Apr 14 2024,negative,so dumb bad acting predictable dumb like really dumb
Apr 14 2024,positive,it is an obvious seven samurai sci fi ripoff seven samurai is an be if my all time favorites  and this movie does it justice the visual effects are outstanding and the creatures are some of the best ever i am very pleased that i turned this on
Apr 13 2024,negative,characters are too dulltoo many unnecessary scenes that tried to look cool no chemistry among the rebels with all the scifi movies and series being released recently this one seems outdated in terms of themes and direction 10 year old kids would love this though
Apr 13 2024,negative,another star wars imitation gone wrong  when the girl brought the bird back to life i just had to laugh what the flip is this 
Apr 10 2024,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever wasted time watching comical how bad this was
Apr 10 2024,negative,visually its a very impressive film lots of great scifi action sequences and the slowmo fight scenes are pretty fun to watch however the overall story feels pretty generic and bland the main characters literally just go on a fetchquest for bunch of people that theyve heard of who can help them on their journey watch as they demonstrate some kind of badass ability or fight and then they join the group thats pretty much it up to the end fight against the main villain which was also pretty underwhelming while it has its fun moments overall it falls pretty flat lets hope part 2 coming up soon expands the story and makes up for the lack of substance in part 1
Apr 9 2024,positive,im impressed with the bad reviewsi loves this series i thing was amazing
Apr 8 2024,positive,everything star wars still wishes it was absolutely brilliant movie
Apr 7 2024,positive,this movie was great  not perfect but great  funny expansive world building familiar but not a duplicate  it was funremember when movies were sometimes just entertaining and fun  when everything did not have to be a shakesperean or orwellian masterpiece and it could just be loud and entertaining and scary and funny and diverting and funwell it was
Apr 7 2024,positive,i really enjoyed the show nd cant wait for part 2
Apr 5 2024,negative,it was rushed and had the most generic charachters and the big finale didnt make any sense a dreadnought that literally leveled planets a minute before gets defeated by a guy with a spear
Apr 4 2024,positive,it was nice break from reality which all this type of movie needs to be looking forward to part 2    if youre expecting cinematic greatness go watch citizen kane or ben hur
Apr 4 2024,positive,i knew nothing about this movie before i stumbled on it wow love the story love the perfectly cast characters it is a great action adventure movie not long before i hit pause to google who the director is no surprise ive watched it twice and will watch it again
Apr 3 2024,positive,rebel moon has rich visual storytelling the opening scene with the narrative of an empirical world who destroyed their planet and the tragedy that forced the loss of their monarchy teasing treachery and political intrigue and strife while introducing an indomitably cruel and sadistic minor antagonist who is but a pawn for the final villain antagonist directing things from the shadows is an ominous launching point for the story      the protragonist kora later to be revealed to be a girl in hiding by another name has an intricately complicated relationship with the final villain antagonist which only strengthens the plot surrounding her journey to gather individuals to her cause that could defeat this indomitable foe    her journey however begins on a planet as a simple farmer but we soon learn what she is and her intricate background soon reveals itself in narrative and action as well as her knowledge of how to deal with the newcomers to the planet veldt which to the imminent peril of the inhabitants of veldt is largely ignored     the history of the story at times is spoken in narratives to move the story along but this seems to be due to the time limits placed on the story which sits roughly at 2 hours and 16 minutes it could have been an 8 hour show filling with  expansive descriptive storytelling about the people the universe and the cultures    the actual narratives accompanied by flashbacks are rich with historical significance and recognizable symbolism and has all the action packed nuance of previous zack snyder works with well choreographed fight scenes that move the story in references to previous scenes and expansion of the influence of powers in the universe these action scenes also offer supplemental knowledge to the dialogue revealing strengths weaknesses and experience of characters that help you understand who they are where they came from and why they are there     this first installment is an incredible introduction into a rich and vibrant universe that has the potential to become more than just the story thats told and i look forward to future installments that continue to create a more vibrant painting of a universe its politics and its people who live within it    with incredible performances by sofia boutella star trek beyond the kingsman the secret service  djimon hounsou gladiator guardians of the galaxy a quiet place  part ii ray fisher justice league the piano lesson  anthony hopkins the silence of the lambs the father one life the mask of zorro and many more
Apr 2 2024,negative,when they walked into a bar full of weird aliens and then immediately picked a fight i told my wife that if they walked out with a guy who had a spaceship to take them to the next place then we were turning it off  so  i dont know what actually happened because i had to be true to my word
Apr 2 2024,neutral,its like it was supposed to be a short series with back stories and subplots but instead we just get little episodes of characters that have meaningless background    cool action scenes but a bit over choreographed    setting changes were jarring and haphazard    and the final scene was completely unnecessary    always good to see my boy charlie hunnam
Apr 1 2024,positive,it wasnt as bad as they say but beautiful visually and we shouldnt forget that 2nd part will also come so just wait and watch
Mar 31 2024,negative,rebel moon starts off quite well but then the actors starting acting and things go way down from there theres also the immense issue with cinematography which is all over the place not bringing the characters to lifeand many many parts of the story feel cheap and hollow    i will not be watching part 2
Mar 31 2024,positive,still enjoyed it thoroughly despite faults
Mar 30 2024,positive,action packed top notch special effects zack has done it again
Mar 30 2024,positive,plot is messy acting is okay too many slow take action scenes but its a solid movie
Mar 28 2024,positive,this was entertaining
Mar 28 2024,negative,dreadful this is why the dc universe was buried watch this then watch dune for a real contrast in film making
Mar 25 2024,negative,two hours of not caring
Mar 24 2024,negative,very predictable storyline     too many cliche characters and introductions of characters with a constant use of average fight scenes to build a connection instead of a compelling narrative     cant go 5minutes without something being in slow mo diminishing actual importantcool parts
Mar 23 2024,negative,why do they have electronic doors but do the rest by hand after this guy has this griffin ride i had enough
Mar 21 2024,positive,could be cool well see if a poor rating from most viewers kills this franchise where it started
Mar 21 2024,positive,yes the dialogue is cheesy yes weve seen all the tropes portrayed in this movie before yes the slomo was gratuitous however the story itself was relatively original most shots were beautiful and theres enough familiarity for any scififantasy fan to just lock in and be entertained for a few hours it may not be groundbreaking but its still a good time and worth a watch if you enjoy the genre dont expect to be blown away by any twists or completely original ideas instead enjoy it for what it is a fun movie with some original creature designs and a classic good vs space nazis plot
Mar 20 2024,negative,absolutely abysmal from beginning to end with laughable action scenes card board cut out characters and the plot my 11 year old self would have written
Mar 19 2024,negative,just a meh i didnt really liked the main character
Mar 19 2024,negative,why introduce man taming griffin when it wont even be of use later
Mar 19 2024,negative,honestly considering how much money and effort was obviously poured into this movie it is one of the worst things ive ever watched there are one or two okay action scenes but even those suffer from being overproduced and pointlessly self indulgent i wish theyd get rid of all the slow motion maybe then theyd have enough time for an actual story terrible dreck but if you are a fan of bad movies a la mst3k there is solid material for riffing here reminds me of battlefield earth
Mar 18 2024,negative,this was nothing more than a pretty collection of tropes
Mar 18 2024,positive,solid scifi movie with tons of emotion a good if not tried and true storyline and one that takes itself seriously in a good way
Mar 18 2024,positive,great movie of every movie iv seen so far in my lifetime this movie along with the scott ridleys alien series with prometheus are thee best i wonder why it only has a low rating do people not know what is good and bad all i can say is thank you zack and cant wait to see the 2nd part of rebel moon
Mar 17 2024,positive,i loved the movie and cast and excited for the second one
Mar 17 2024,negative,i just find it boring it just drags on and then teases a part 2 but i dont care enough about the story or the cliché characters to want to sit through a sequel
Mar 17 2024,neutral,the story is borrowed from quite a few different sources so i felt like id seen the movie several times before in some form or another the fight scenes werent very well done the slow motion theyre shot in looked to me as if they were trying to hide how bad they were but eventually made them look worse     i do give kudos to the worldbuilding visuals they were awesome
Mar 16 2024,negative,while it has some good visuals everything else was just off i found myself struggling to pay attention and the overabundance of slowmotion sequences was downright exhausting
Mar 16 2024,negative,this movie was in the same category as the perils of gwendolyn in the land of the yic yak which i saw on the recommendation of a 16 year old video store clerk 35 years ago lolso that makes it the second worst movie i have ever seen i did force myself to finish it
Mar 16 2024,negative,the movie had a good idea but it looks like they couldnt implement their idea even though its visually brilliant and a good idea the plot doesnt stick together the characters are largely flat to sum up it was a waste of time
Mar 16 2024,positive,i really dont understand the hate i agree its not totally original but i was entertained looking forward to seeing the second half and the r rated versions
Mar 16 2024,negative,yet another seven samurai retelling this time as written by an apparent 15 year old who wanted to incorporate every scifi and anime character they ever encountered
Mar 15 2024,negative,i could only manage 25 minutes of this it is so bad it was awful truly terrible pacing was incredibly slow characters were all people i wish they would all kill one another to save me the pain of watching any more i just couldnt take it anymore after 25 minutes thanks but no thanks
Mar 15 2024,neutral,i have no idea why people equate it with a star wars rip off it seemed much more like a chronicle of riddick missed with bad amime like one piece input vin diesel in the main character and boom same thing its visually good but world building was rushed and clearly made to be 3 movies not one that stands on its own
Mar 14 2024,negative,an absolute mess boring and had really bad acting
Mar 14 2024,positive,i really enjoy this film the colors tone and pace excited to see the directors cut and then part 2
Mar 13 2024,positive,seeing as all the reviews seem to be terrible i have to say i am very surprised by that i found the movie to be very good as i am not one to usually watch scifi movies my father turned it on while playing board games and i surprisingly was drawn to it instantly i think the main issue now days is people not being able to understand some movies arent for them and instead of giving feedback of proscons its a constant attack against the director and actorsactresses excited for part two
Mar 13 2024,neutral,some good materials a real potential but it would deserve more screen time to go into details a series format would have been more appropriate
Mar 9 2024,positive,way better than your stupid plastic star wars  seems to be mockery of every bit of scifi movies for the last decade or two
Mar 8 2024,positive,awesome popcorn si fi flick cant wait till next harsh critics can go fly a kite
Mar 7 2024,positive,as someone who had nothing to do with the making of the film i thought it was a fun new adventure something that wasnt already an established franchise like all the garbage that comes out of the disney franchises these days that everybody seems to want to compare everything else to as if there some kind of masterpiece that being said this movie is not immune to some hiccups   but i was entertained swept up into the universe love the cast and the special effects i was away from the worlds problems for a few hours and enjoyed it which is at its core what entertainment is supposed to do i look forward   to part 2
Mar 7 2024,negative,im just not sure why this needed to be made it felt like the plot for a video game from the early 2000s everything felt rather flat and uninspired and there were too many characters and not enough development or performance to make me care about any of them
Mar 7 2024,positive,i really enjoyed watching and am looking forward to the next movie  i like the different angles and direction the director has used
Mar 7 2024,negative,this was trash going in not knowing anything about the movie i actually paused it to see if it was not the result of some kind of high school project the acting was ordinary possibly the result of a poor script and the story was just lazy it was so bad that it inspired me to leave my first ever review
Mar 7 2024,positive,i dont pay much attention to what the critics have to say about any movie i rate my movies based on if i was entertained and i was
Mar 6 2024,negative,overall this movie is bad but not funny bad the first thing one notices right away are the very unnatural cheesy dialogues that seems to spawn out of the blue then the acting even the main character is really bad maybe they had a really tight budget because they spent everything on visuals which is the only somewhat decent thing in the movie the plot is also fact paced and confusing with many unnecessary details that do not make any sense they use a lot of speech to fill in the gaps but it is not enough and it comes off weird if i have to read the book in order to understand the movie its not a good movie i had to quit halfway because it wasnt fun conclusion rotten do not watch unless you want to waste your time especially if you liked the book
Mar 6 2024,negative,not zacks best work at all i dont want to spoil anything for those who havent seen it but if you watched any scifi of the last 50 yrs you have seen this mess some good actors but a lot of over acting too in strange scenes not edited well
Mar 5 2024,positive,this was a cool movie low score likely from excess of expectations 
Mar 5 2024,positive,i honestly didnt see why everyone was bashing the movie the way they did was a decent action movie with a good special effects for a straight to tv movie yes some of the characters are cliche but you cant be too original now because everything has pretty much been done already id say watch it for yourself before casting judgement and formulate your own opinion on whether or not its a good movie
Mar 4 2024,negative,those were 136 minutes of my life i will never get backsuch potential perhaps the only thing were the special effects everything else was so purely done from the script to the acting to the storyline 
Mar 3 2024,negative,god this movie is awful  the cgi and the action is good but the rest  the characters are boring and forgettable and they are a copypaste of other characters  the villain is the most generic bad dude you could see in a movie  its a ripoff of dragonballstar wars and harry potter  i still ask to myself how snyderbozos like movies like this
Mar 2 2024,positive,it has beautiful scenery and effects the antagonist really leaves an impression the protagonist leaves us wondering a bit  to be honest it feels rushed at some points so its not easy caring about some characters but its a cool actionscifi movie overall  i went in with no expectations and was surprised so give it a chance if you like the genre and do the same if youre looking for something life changing and extremely mind blowing this one might not be for you though
Feb 27 2024,negative,an absolute mess a hodgepodge of the worst scifi elements all in one film
Feb 26 2024,negative,worst waste of perfectly good effects since ad astra why not take one of the great scifi plots radch with a similar setting and make an awesome movie
Feb 25 2024,negative,this is unbearable garbage  23 of the movie is slo motion and the other third is lens flares    i am baffled on how you can rip off so many plot points from other franchises and yet end up with a nonsensical plot
Feb 25 2024,negative,absolute trash in every way just horrible i cant believe theres going to be a second part to this i wont be wasting my money on it again
Feb 25 2024,positive,i enjoyed it looking forward to the extended cut which tends to be snyders bread and butter
Feb 24 2024,negative,garbage i feel sad for all the artists the time and effort to produce this visually just to have the dumbest story i have ever heard     this is my first review of anything ever this is how upsetting i found this garbage
Feb 24 2024,positive,the movie had good visuals and good storyline
Feb 24 2024,positive,as the beginning of a story rebel moon hits all the marks it aims to its a film that wears its influences on its sleeve and still manages to provide a few surprises along the way in particular the films handling of major themes like colonialism and empire are topnotch providing a grounding realism to what could have been simply a flashy space adventure
Feb 24 2024,positive,the first hour felt interesting enough  the second hour felt generic and ultimately not very satisfyingcompelling
Feb 24 2024,positive,it tries to create this big world but gets rushed and ends up to be flat  in summary its a chain of quick quests to get new companions so you can fight the final boss
Feb 24 2024,negative,theres a lot of potential in rebel moons universe but the haphazardly handled mess of a story proves to be a dumb ride from planet to planet in search for a team to fight a battle that never takes place in this movie anyway
Feb 23 2024,positive,i was thoroughly entertained good vs evil i watched it for entertainment only not to pick it apart
Feb 23 2024,negative,slomo more slomo slomo agian it was literally only slomos fight scenes were really bad animals well animated robots having to much of human movement no one asked for backstory got it anyway exact the same scenes from hp star wars etc good plot
Feb 23 2024,positive,the more i watch the better it gets
Feb 23 2024,positive,enjoyable film loved the action and visuals looking forward to part 2
Feb 22 2024,positive,visually stunning but the story plot does need some work all in all i actually quite enjoy this movie honestly dont get why it get so much hate starting to think it got reviewed bombed pay for by disney to keep their starwars franchise on top
Feb 21 2024,positive,despite the vitriol it received i oddly found some enjoyment in this film its concept may not be original but the cgi effects managed to shine hinting at a potential for redemption in the upcoming sequel
Feb 21 2024,neutral,nothing is special about this film and a handful of moments like an acting performance are terrible this was part one of a twopart story well see if i see the second part what i know is that i dont have any investment in the characters
Feb 21 2024,positive,so happy i got to see this in 70mm after a slow start once the movie kicks into high gear it never lets up sofia is a star and a great lead the other characters couldve been more fleshed out but still do enough to be memorable cant wait to see the sequel and the extended rated r cuts
Feb 20 2024,positive,great visual effects pretty trash acting but i think its more due to poor lineswriting and attempts to make scenes grandiose and significant and sooo much slow motion all in all its pretty cringe to get through
Feb 20 2024,negative,omg i cant stand watching scenes in slow motion anymore other than that the movie is only beautiful thats it
Feb 20 2024,positive,didnt blow me away was good to watch worth its time
Feb 20 2024,negative,uggh  this is not an homage to star wars but rather a dull mockery of it so many stolen ideas but even worse so very very boring none of the characters are developed and one feels no investment in any character honestly i was rooting for the bad guys to use their death star spaceship to blow up everything so that the movie would end alas no such luck
Feb 19 2024,negative,this had a lot of potential but the best character in the film is the villain if the film had a longer run time it couldve had the opportunity to flesh out the characters further as you get no time to develop any care for them
Feb 19 2024,negative,this film was lame flaccid boring and had really bad acting i had to stop watching after 45min dont watch unless youre so bored that this couldnt possibly bore you any further
Feb 19 2024,negative,this is literally the worst movie ive watched the last 10 years please dont make a sequel
Feb 19 2024,positive,movie visually wow scenery colors tones depth use of slow motion action scenes look pretty good better with some then others story was basic but that is ok most movies take from others n combined and rename etc i would easily recommend this movie which i hope turns into a universe of its own n competes well with rated r n pg13 titles id love for zack to get a world to display his talents because they r so amazing n this movie shows it omg if u thought light sabers were cool this movie does it way better so stop reading and check it out emerge urself into the world of rebel moon u wont want to leave i promise
Feb 19 2024,positive,i liked it the visual effects are amazing and acting is very good although the storyline seems to be borrowed in parts from different movies such as star wars it is grand epic has a twist and certainly is entertaining the good wins over the evil at the end and thankfully no animals were killed in the process good movie and look forward to part 2
Feb 19 2024,positive,really solid movie i know that due to hype and other factors some had really high expectations but this movie exceeded my expectations 10 out of 10 will watch it again right before part 2 comes out
Feb 18 2024,negative,poor dialog poor character development and even poor action scenes
Feb 18 2024,positive,fantastic fights  female protagonist  whats not to like  simplest dialog i will admit but the fantastic visuals are holding all of your attention anyway  i hope everyone who loves a rebel joins me in watching this exciting movie i cant wait for episode 2
Feb 18 2024,positive,entertaining its like if star wars and dune had a baby
Feb 18 2024,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed this film as a fan of star wars its a big reason why i enjoy it i understand for some it feels like a blatant ripoff in a lot of aspects but i think it still does a good job at being its own thing and having its own unique creatures etc the constant slowmo shots were very repetitive and annoying and would constantly take me out of what was happening but its still a fun movie not the greatest thing ever but also not as bad as people make it out to be really like the main character and im excited to watch part 2
Feb 18 2024,positive,i liked the plot characters were badass effects were decent dark tones and atmosphere i liked the different alien and costumes bad guys were your typical space nazis and the main antagonist has a face that screams punchable
Feb 18 2024,negative,too bad this film couldve really been something interesting
Feb 18 2024,positive,too bad its so cliche and predictable set pieces can be fun at times
Feb 18 2024,negative,this movie was a potential star wars script abandoned adopted and adapted its a dei mess of a movie with zero character development plot line or focus most of the main characters dont even have lines for roughly thirty minutes of the movie the only thing missing from this absolute disaster of a movie is a heist montage to the tune of a rick and morty satire
Feb 18 2024,negative,put in a blender  star wars blade runner the man in the high castle frankenstein and all the other basic clichés of movies and voilà rebel moon 
Feb 17 2024,negative,why even on a part 2 the sound was great other than that a cheesy film with bad acting and directing
Feb 16 2024,negative,you can call this movie war because it too is good for absolutely nothing
Feb 16 2024,negative,if you like slow motion shots then this will be for you as every other shot is a slow motion sequence there were even slower motion moments within slow motion shots  appears if there is a directors cut that kept all the charachter development to itself charachters killed off with the music in the background trying to bring some emotion it seems but we dont know why as a viewer that we should care as dont know anything about them other than they turned up 10 minutes ago with a big build up to it  i am a big fan of the genre but think i will give the sequel a miss
Feb 16 2024,negative,devoid of creativity humor originality and entertainment value as soulles as if it were generated by an ai chatbot
Feb 16 2024,neutral,great cast some great actors in the film i think instead of two part it definitely shouldve been compressed into one movie with a load of the unnecessary scenes cut out they attempted to make some epic character introductions which felt pretty cringe    parts of the movie had literally no impact on the overall story apart from being filler why the heck are some characters speaking in an irish accent the plot twists were mediocre and overall progression of the film was disappointing    its not something you should go out of your way to watch however i will give part 2 a watch as hopefully its a slightly better than part one
Feb 15 2024,negative,extremely slow paced with way too much slomo shots and terrible dialogue feels like star wars meets gladiator but nothing but the boring parts this movie is a skip for sure
Feb 15 2024,positive,good story line great acting will  definetely watch next one 
Feb 15 2024,negative,frankensteins monster of all of scifi movies from last 3 decades
Feb 15 2024,positive,i enjoyed watching this movie more than the star wars movies i hope this movie will be even better in the second part
Feb 14 2024,negative,when you are counting the minutes to get to the ending  the best part of this movie was the credits
Feb 14 2024,negative,it was like watching a bad remake of the magnificent seven only with 4 or 5 of them and quite cartoony as well i expected a science fiction movie and i saw a western
Feb 14 2024,negative,its a terrible version of star wars with a shallow plot characters without any charisma excessive clichés no originality poorly done visual effects  a waste of time
Feb 14 2024,negative,no ideastotally ugly
Feb 14 2024,positive,this scifi action movie was pretty good sofia boutella michiel huisman charlie hunnam ed skrein and the rest of the cast did a pretty good job in this movie the plot of the movie was actionpacked dramatic and thrilling its about fighting against an enemy that wants to destroy everything if you havent seen this movie yet check it out sometime its not great but its still worth it
Feb 13 2024,negative,well its better than the last two star wars filmand the only reason why this film is better than those is because this film is its own universe and they are not breaking established lore this film would be better as a tv series since they can develop the characters and their stories a lot more than a movie can
Feb 13 2024,neutral,really good visual effects but the story was hot garbage and left me feeling disappointed tbh
Feb 13 2024,negative,dumb derivative unoriginal and all too serious about it
Feb 13 2024,negative,i was excited for this but it was really really bad aside from a one good action sequence the acting story and cgi was kind of pathetic 
Feb 12 2024,positive,it was actually really good the story made sense and the graphics were a chefs kiss i like the idea of space bounty hunters and a medieval space war type thing i highly recommend seeing it 
Feb 12 2024,negative,terribly boring i couldnt even finish 60 minutes of this movie and ill watch anything  dont waste your time  watch the local news instead
Feb 11 2024,positive,has awful pacing but has amazing visual effects and great characters
Feb 11 2024,neutral,completely lacking in originality and personality but entertaining enough scifi action and drama with a dark and serious setting  the interplanetary settings and cgi mostly look good as did the frequent action scenes even if the amount of slowmotion was bordering on excessive  the plot is your typical child of destiny starting a rebellion to take down the space nazis by recruiting a multicultural team but the acting felt awkward rather than dramatic and the lower age rating made it feel a bit tame  hopefully the next film will add some depth to the characters and explore the interesting seeds such as the robots humanity
Feb 11 2024,positive,this was such a fun riveting watch not sure why the rating was so low but i enjoyed it
Feb 11 2024,negative,this is a movie depiction of the word bloviate    look it up  its a real word
Feb 10 2024,negative,its nice that im all the scifi to offs and the jarringly dull slow motion action sequences they still found time to rip off harry potter and tame a griffin with a different director and editor this could have been entertaining
Feb 9 2024,negative,bang bang boooom ptow ptow ptow boooom and in slow motion booooooooooooooom noooooooooooo bang boooom    and thats the best dialogue in the film
Feb 9 2024,negative,i like the robot too much slow motion stop idolizing allllllll of the characters
Feb 7 2024,positive,this movie lacks in early character development but doesnt disappoint with a healthy supply of action and plot events  i think it is easy to dock the movie for the early lack of plot but it also must be remembered that this is part 1 and if part 2 delivers the same amount of action and build upon the lackluster story it might blossom into what most of us would consider a terrific sci fi film
Feb 7 2024,positive,gritty stunning builds a universe on the genius of star wars dune bladerunner et al  i cannot disagree with the critics on the concepts stolen but does this movie not combine the best of elements of the above  epic landscapes worlds dedicated to mining human nature at is worst greed and power and best  where it is unique is in not introducing jedi force magic like star wars therein lies the fantasy of childhood dreams   however we do have several magnificent samurai  who although they do not use magic are so incredibly talented that we are being led to believe that they alone can take a stand against a hugely powerful controlling empire like governance  the magnificent seven the samurai too were outnumbered but not outgunned  in this first movie the inspirational characters needed more development they needed to perhaps survive an attack and realize that they needed to split up and rally their own factions over time  the village is merely symbolic here its about the struggle against a cruel oppressive rule a fight for peace through autonomy a drive for fairness and respect in that respect it is or should not be the seven samurai sadly the closing scenes are the seven back on the original planet perhaps the second movie will see people and weapons flocking to the planet but somehow i doubt it sadly those super hero types will be held responsible for the defense rather than use their influence to gather support inspire resistance against the oppressor lead a truly sizeable force  but then will we criticize for copying star wars again easily done but unfair every historical battle has had its unequal sides but always had the weaker been able to take stands against the stronger  should the resistance in this movie franchise start a guerilla war  inflicting stings and retreating into the shadows or will we then criticize it for representing the futility of our own struggles against oppressive governments and controlling mega corporations  ultimately it may come over as a twee feel good movie based on the fantasy that a small number of skilled individuals can single handedly deliver us from tirany  i wish is the downfall of any review lets look at what we have consider the concepts the screenplay the cinematography the predictable script the heroes the obvious weak points in the oppressive regime and realize that those of us who hoped for an adult scifi have sadly been let down at least there wasnt a gun toting raccoon and small taking tree in this one  do we think the producers and directors had to fall foul of the modern movie scourge of general box office appeal  capitalism scores another nail in the coffin of individualism and uniqueness
Feb 5 2024,positive,rebel moon part 1 a child of fire  57  so from the get to i had mixed feelings about this movie it was okay it was not as bad as some or the internet portrayed it to be but it was by no means great it felt like a rushed edgier version of star wars the fight sceens were great that was the bread and butter but the actual character development and plot seemed extremely rushed for starters so the main plot the army needed to take over this planet to feed its entire army and then a gang of like 6 people were going to take on this army seemed very far fetched the twist was unexpected but it was also a character that i most liked so far so that caught me off guard overall it was worth the watch for the fight scenes and pure action alone but this movie is no second coming of star wars or any space saga  hopefully the second part will be alittle better and i will be there to check it out the robot ended up being my favorite character for what it is worth official sundaynightstreaming rating of 57
Feb 5 2024,positive,i realy enjoyed this film best film i have seen this year 2024  lots of action good acting and special effects i also liked the story  part 1 and i cannot wait for part 2   i am going to watch it again and update my review further
Feb 5 2024,positive,five adults watched it five adults enjoyed it of course it is founded on kirosawas  seven samurai and is not the first to do it but does that make it any less fun  not for us
Feb 4 2024,negative,the visuals are interesting at times especially the alien creatures and some of the ship and the sound effects are very good for me i cant think of a single other positive this is simply an extremely poor movie possibly the worst i have seen in over a decade the dialog is just atrocious the acting at best wooden and the plot somehow manages to be super predictable and at the same time absolute nonsense action scenes were so poorly done that they were immersion breaking i struggled to watch    i think the only reason to watch this is for the curiosity of wanting to watch a high budget car crash of a movie
Feb 4 2024,negative,its as if someone with no knowledge of the genre looked at what they thought worked in every other scifi movie and threw it together in a willy nilly way    its as if donald trump made a movie
Feb 4 2024,positive,i dont see how its low rated i thought it was a series and i wanted episode 2 but it was too long to be one episode cant wait for part 2 if the only knock is it borrows story parts from other movies then that tells you all you need to know its a great movie and they just found something to give it a negative review watch it i really liked it anything in space has to be compared to star wars so if its not a star wars story its a problem ridiculous banter i tell you
Feb 4 2024,neutral,ambitiousness and worldbuilding are the key elements of the film but lacks in character depth and originality
Feb 4 2024,negative,i should like this movie it is sci fi action great effects but for some reason i didnt when i thought about why i realised it is because i had no affinity with any of the characters i didnt really care if they lived or died the only one i warmed to was the faceless robot there is no soul in this movie
Feb 4 2024,negative,really pretty scenes with a less than story i actually love all the cast but the script story and pacing were lacking
Feb 4 2024,positive,this story has obvious parallels to the seen samurai the first part is about their selection ending with their return to the village and the resurrection of the evil outlaw part two will undoubtedly continue the saga of the defense of the villagemoon not sure what all the fuss is aboutits like complaining the magnificent seven wasnt as good as the original samurai film just make some popcorn and chill
Feb 3 2024,positive,if you love scifi and love fantasy rebel moon will not disappoint     zack is building such an epic universe and this film feels like its only scratching the surface     sofia boutella is an incredible leading lady and ed skrein as admiral noble is terrifying     if you cant wait for the rrated cut i highly recommend picking up the novelization the pg13 version doesnt do the story justice
Feb 3 2024,negative,beyond bad incoherent derivative sloppy boring the narrative was nonsensical the action was boring the stylish cinematics were interestingin 300 now they are just tired massively overdone and forced  the movie was overly long while still managing to feel like another two hours were needed to actually clue the audience into the motivations of the many characters none of whom were anything but one dimensional caricatures of bad tropes to begin with  i truly wish i could get the time back in my life that was wasted on this utter garage of a movie  i knew exactly what was going to happen at the end even while there being nothing whatsoever that could have clued the audience in why because it was the stupidest possible thing to happen and that tracked with how bad the movie was  the only halfway decent thing about the movie were the special effects too bad they were so horribly wasted on this trash movie  now pardon me while i leap is slow motion through the air in exactly the same way nearly every character does to come crashing down with whatever random weapon assigned to me onto something that will have zero actual consequence again oh just for giggles again once more because its apparently my signature and my fans wont know that its my review without it being done again and again seriously this movie sucked
Feb 3 2024,negative,omg the slowmo shots in every action sequence the story was simple worldbuilding mediocre a fine movie wish it was set in a richer universe star wars
Feb 2 2024,positive,a visually stunning and engaging movie like any first entry the focus is on world and lore building so the story does come across a bit linear and straight forward but there is definitely depth and lots more to know before it can be termed simply as a star wars rip off maybe this was what the new trilogy should have been 
Jan 31 2024,negative,film with a fantastic heroine a phenomenal killing machine the depicted world is somewhat absurd plowing the land using a horse and plow accompanied by spaceships simplicity mental shortcuts and stereotypes
Jan 31 2024,positive,i think people need to not be so over critical about this movie yes it not very original but what is these days the cast is impressive and delivered in the acting department the story was predictable but the majority of stories are these days i say its not about if it is original but how well the already done ideas were executed i personally thought this movie was executed very well hell i liked this better than the first part of dune and i love dune scifi movies are mostly garbage right now so this was a breath of fresh air for me i just think everyone should give this one a chance or even a second chance if they didnt like it the first time
Jan 30 2024,positive,not a great movie on many levels i still watch part 2 though maybe somehow this gets better part of the world is intriguing
Jan 30 2024,negative,the action sequences are ruined by the constant use of slowmotion the story does not make sense and the characters are bland
Jan 30 2024,positive,the action and visuals are great some of the choreography appeared slow at times though  the villains are vicious story can be predictable but so was dune still a good watch
Jan 29 2024,negative,the movie ruined my saturday evening but i couldnt turn it off because i kept hoping it would get better    i knew about the bad reviews and the story which is quite close to star wars i usually dont mind that at all and i thought that the bad review could have come from a lot of star wars fanboys who just wanted to hate around    unfortunately the movie is really bad its like someone watched star wars drunken while reading a fantasy novel and the next morning made a movie out of what he could remember     in one of the comments i read something about dazzling lights or dazzling scenes thats not an exaggeration and it is not meant in a figurative sense really disturbing
Jan 28 2024,positive,highly recommended not sure what is wrong with the critics as they seem to have forgotten what pure escapism is
Jan 28 2024,negative,fun visuals terrible terrible terrible writing
Jan 28 2024,positive,im glad that i didnt listen to the reviews i really enjoyed it maybe no emmys in its future but worth the watch
Jan 27 2024,positive,id describe it as a star wars wannabe movie  pretty much the same plot line  but they didnt quite pull it off  visually it was excellent but character wise and plot wise it just didnt resonate all the way  really bewildering character decisions that keep the plot going or turn it on a dime like putting a weapon in the hands of your enemy telling them to do one thing then being surprised when they use it on you kind of thing also the actors and actresses were a little to glam looking for the character experiences they were representing that didnt quite work for me
Jan 27 2024,negative,just another lowquality girl boss movie with exceptionally mediocre acting and i have so many questions why does charlie hunnam just stand in the background not talking for almost the entire movie why keep introducing main characters halfway through the film how is it that the farmers have no weapons wouldnt they all be dead long ago too many plot holes
Jan 26 2024,negative,cringing in slow motion  this is a difficult movie to watch to the end the beginning the first 5 minutes is so absurdly bad that it feels like the film is a sarcastic parody of star wars but the narrative tone suggests otherwise it seems like a script that wants to be taken seriously but lacks a compelling story is verbose constantly overexplains itself with many loose ends in the plot caricatured characters lacking charisma and clichés the cinematography is poor the choice of lenses is subpar with characters participating in a scene appearing out of focus or blurred always always slow motion cheesy soundtrack this is bad in everyway
Jan 25 2024,positive,not bad not really great though flingers crossed the director cut will make this movie really shine cause i wouldnt say any scenes were bad enough to take out they just didnt really add up to a whole lot the actions cool characters were given a good start in this film it just felt like right now we dont have enough at least not yet
Jan 24 2024,negative,the movie was so bad that i registered on this site just to write a review the story is plain stupid just doesnt make sense casting is bad characters are flat acting is really bad  i only watched it till the end because it was the only thing i downloaded for a flight dont make the same mistake its a waste of over 2hrs
Jan 23 2024,positive,more seventh samurai than star wars and i dug it a lot loved all the scenes with jimmy and kora    most of the issues i have with the pacing will hopefully be fixed in the directors cut nice introduction to this world that sets the stage for part 2
Jan 23 2024,negative,bad poorly writen movie    in just 6 minutes the movie alread remakes the morpheus speech in matrix reloaded in a poorly way that is  just the genining of a convoluted movie with nonsensical plot points bad dialogue e boring action scenes the pay offs are so close to the set ups that never gives you a sense of satisfation not recommend i would give 25 if it was a normal movie but for a pretentions one it only deserves 15
Jan 23 2024,negative,visually spectacular otherwise its just every trope from star wars dune and 300 put in a blender with no character development surprises or story arc to speak of amazing to me that it got made with such a poor script
Jan 22 2024,negative,was expecting a bad movie really liked zacks justice league bat v sup 300 etc i dont hate the guy  i get his vibe  but this movie started so slow  than it was wrapped up in 10 min and it didnt end a part 2 and 3 look to me like a really really long boring movie and still felt like quality somehow skinny girl beating up grown man wasnt to much some things didnt come across it had so character development in a way but not really it felt like explained character for a new franchises universe boring waste of time and jet  i didnt hate it it was only just before the battle sequence i started looking at my phone  thinking of some random thing the movie lost me would i watch the movie knowing what i know now  probably not do i feel like 3 hours of my life got stolen no would i watch part 2  probably not unless im bored
Jan 22 2024,positive,i took forever to watch the movie due to the bombreviewing of internet but in my opinion the only fair complaint is the bunch of unnecessary slow motion other than that the movie is pretty good
Jan 22 2024,positive,expecting the worst but found it quit good
Jan 22 2024,positive,its okay i like the idea but i think its too much star wars its like irish farmers that meets nazi people that beat the others with a stick i dont have a good view on the characters and they have a bad dialogue
Jan 21 2024,positive,fantastic from visuals to charactersactors and storyline  cant wait for part 2
Jan 21 2024,negative,slow motion vfxcgifight scenes are good  story script  screenplay are very weak
Jan 21 2024,positive,its a good movie the beginning is slightly cheesy but it the quality improves drastically as the movie progresses i dont really understand the harsh reviews its entertaining and keeps you watching
Jan 21 2024,negative,action packed and a good visual flair great but the story is terrible too many characters we dont know anything about or care about the movie has to provide exposition or statement about the character because even if they have been with the group for half the movie we dont know who they are or care about them
Jan 21 2024,positive,art should be appreciated for the effort it takes clearly great effort and good story
Jan 21 2024,positive,it was visually appealing interesting storyline i like zack snyders directing dialogue isnt tarantino but it doesnt have to be story is a little fuzzy in transition but overall every entertaining cant wait for the next episode
Jan 20 2024,positive,a unique start for an imaginative new universe clearly in need of the extended cut but a really good movie in its own right
Jan 20 2024,negative,nothing original predictable with bad acting and poorly designed characters
Jan 20 2024,negative,wanted to like it but in throughout the entire runtime nothing really happens the movie introduces several different characters but doesnt give any one of them enough screen time or backstory to make you actually connect with them in anyway just a completely forgettable movie
Jan 19 2024,positive,rebel moon is basically if star wars was good seems very similar but missing the wildly cringey and horrible special effects of star wars excited for the next one
Jan 19 2024,positive,really enjoyed the movie set up a foundation for characters great world building and amazing visuals looking forward to part 2
Jan 19 2024,positive,i was excited to see this one with all the hype around it but it really didnt live up to expectations it was entertaining and ill probably watch part 2 but im not chomping at the bit waiting for it
Jan 19 2024,neutral,it feels broken and has so many plot holes i just gave up im blaming the writers for this bad score the actors did the best they could
Jan 19 2024,negative,flashy visuals and character design cant save this warhammer 40kstar wars mashup
Jan 18 2024,positive,the cinematography the everything it was like a greek tragedy but with the scale of science fiction
Jan 18 2024,negative,boring not a clear storyline
Jan 17 2024,negative,ive seen a lot of reviews talking about how much of this movie is borrowed from better ones but i think the writing and story direction are still its biggest issues the characters barely talk to each other and it is often actively painful to listen to what they do say its so boring and disjointed i actually missed them recruiting that general not that it mattered because he barely does anything
Jan 17 2024,negative,this movie is so bad i actually got a rotten tomatoes account so i could tell everyone how bad this is    some people say quite generously i think this is a space opera in the vein of the seven samurai    that is an insult to at least six of the seven samurai    this is more like a over cgd version of battle beyond the stars which in itself was a poor copy of the seven samurai but at least the characters were well developed    rotten tomates is making me rate this movie by the use of stars    i gave it a half a star but if it were up to me i would give it half of a protostar    to be honest much like a plate of brussel sprouts i couldnt finish watching the movie but i had eaten enough to know it had a terrible taste and needed a couple glasses of something to force it down my gullet    they could have reformed alex in the movie a clockwork orange by making him watch this instead of ultraviolence    could have cured him in half the time imho    when part ii comes out please find something less painful to do like have a fullyclawed cat high on catnip check your head for lice i dunno
Jan 17 2024,negative,i had high hopes for this but it felt like it left a lot on the table as to what it could have been
Jan 17 2024,negative,plot and story lines disconnected and confusing
Jan 16 2024,positive,plenty of action and great acting  i cant wait for part 2 people that never like scifi should stop reviewing things they inherently dislike
Jan 16 2024,negative,horrid i cant believe this was made
Jan 16 2024,positive,its so so good space fans will love it
Jan 16 2024,negative,you must have to have read the book first even with the part 1 warning this movie really goes nowhere and takes it sweet time doing it  the second half will have you asking is this the same movie ive been watching  i may not be who can tell
Jan 15 2024,negative,i wish i didnt have to give this half a star this was so bad just because you have the budget to put in everything doesnt mean you should i felt like i was watching 20 different movies in the span of two hours no world building no character development  and an unnecessary amount  of slow motion
Jan 15 2024,negative,dont waste your time it is literally a copy of everything and nothing the characters have no strength charisma or character the special effects are good but you cant base a movie on cgi it is also absolutely predictable from start to finish
Jan 15 2024,negative,couldnt even get past the 30 minute mark terrible movie
Jan 15 2024,positive,honestly based on the reviews i initially anticipated this film to be nearly unwatchable however when my wife and i decided to give it a chance we were pleasantly surprised    while the film introduces viewers to a rich and expansive new universe with intricate characters and deep motivations it is not without its flaws the main issue lies in its duration as it undeniably needed an extra hour or more    the pacing feels rushed and if the intention was to encourage viewers to watch the extended cut it would leave me feeling somewhat deceived    i find myself wishing this were a series rather than a film allowing each character the opportunity to shine with a longer runtime from the start this could potentially evolve into a new cult classic and the decision not to provide it with ample time was a significant oversight
Jan 15 2024,negative,did i just watch a slow motion star wars film
Jan 15 2024,negative,there is something like tooooo much slowmo and rule of cool  more story and not so obius nsc characters would help  and what the hell was with the teeth    only good thing are the visuals    the saddest thing is that i was kinda looking forward for this franchise
Jan 15 2024,positive,mehwas not a fan of all the slow motion fight scenes just gets annoying if i happen to miss part two not the end of the world
Jan 15 2024,positive,it was refreshing to see something new
Jan 15 2024,positive,fun movie it has some pacing issues but its not terrible
Jan 15 2024,positive,i loved it but i love sci fi and fantasy
Jan 15 2024,positive,storyline was great super fantasy graphics amazing action keeps you on your feet character development is in tact not sure why so many low ratings am i missing something cant wait for part 2
Jan 14 2024,negative,very slow and not well written the dialogue is weak and the entire movie relies on visuals and well worn scifi character tropes very disappointed it wasnt more original
Jan 14 2024,negative,a cliché built from various other works that didnt have as striking an impact as their counterparts coupled with lapses in the remembrance of characters in the storyline and somewhat weak cinematographyconfusing action scenes and unnecessary framings
Jan 14 2024,positive,it wasnt the best movie but not the worst either very predictable girl boss scifi flick some nice visuals but terribly simplistic dialog
Jan 14 2024,positive,great movie to watch with the kids beautiful scenery thanks for making this
Jan 14 2024,positive,i liked it for the wh40k vibe
Jan 14 2024,positive,love the scifi and the special effects but the story line is so so however ill wait for part ii
Jan 14 2024,positive,loved it  great world building  cant wait to see where they take it
Jan 14 2024,positive,its not the most amazing or original movie but its entertaining and the visuals are great
Jan 14 2024,positive,epic space fantasy incredible representation of other worlds a wonderful escape from  well my daily life     i dont agree with the movie critics who appear too hung up with derivative references to other movies and consequently and imho inappropriately rating movies down i have worked for many years with professional music recordings and quite frankly everything is derivative  and it is of little relevance this movie was an epic emotional and experiential escape  and yes it is a movie  and not a tv series like star wars andor where the time for solid character development is readily available nevertheless it was easy to connect and empathise with the salient protagonists against the nazilike galactic regime and enjoy the journey and vision delivered in rebel moon
Jan 14 2024,positive,its a good action movie typical for this genre charactersnice plot great visuals truly i dont understand why so many people dislike it i cant wait for the next chapter
Jan 14 2024,positive,ticks all of the boxes nothing new but lots of shazam and everything i needed in a great scifi movie i loved it
Jan 14 2024,positive,i did not expect this movie to be this good me and my wife loved it and i can not wait for part 2
Jan 14 2024,negative,shame  the first part is ok nice setting and visuals a bit slow the movie starts derailing pretty hard at the star wars like saloon scene after that its a crazy rush sequence of characters and story threads with no rationale whatsoeverall random
Jan 14 2024,positive,could have should have been much better visually beautiful like everything he does but the story which had potential was extremely rushed part one should have ended with the search for the team instead we get the team no character development or attachment then battle some die dont care
Jan 13 2024,positive,not a bad movie if you dont expect much it feels like a combination of sci fi and fantasy movies from the past but it was entertaining and beautiful to watch
Jan 13 2024,positive,i knew nothing about this going in unlike other reviewers who thought the movie opened slowly i thought the first halfhour was terrific leading up to a satisfying action scene that set the story up beautifully then it turned into seven samuraithe magnificent seven but in space and i was fine with that but the script had to give each warrior a developed backstory that made their joining the crusade plausible in the first place not just a great fight scene
Jan 13 2024,negative,after i watched star wars as a kid i was drawing vader his tie fighter lightsabers xwings and star destroyers death star of course and tons of other designs  i want to ask modern kids  do they remember anything from this film worthy to draw
Jan 13 2024,negative,what a sad movie my husband and i were really looking forward to it but we turned it off half way through because we got bored we turned it on again the next day i think sad that i cant remember for sure but it was all just too violent for us the effects were amazing of course but far behind what we were hoping to see overall
Jan 13 2024,negative,planet of hot farm workers lol
Jan 13 2024,negative,ive never rated a movie on this site before and i probably never will again i disliked this movie so much that i created this account just to tell anyone who reads this to stay as far away from this movie as you can please for the love of god save your 2 hours and 14 minutes go do anything else with the limited amount of time you have left on this earth
Jan 13 2024,positive,i love the world that was created and cant wait to see where it leads
Jan 13 2024,positive,it isnt bad but not great it is basically a remake of battle beyond the stars
Jan 12 2024,negative,overreliance on cgi and action sequences a plot that doesnt make any sense and poor character development this movie is absolutely not the next star wars
Jan 12 2024,negative,the story seemed rushed and acting was horriffic
Jan 12 2024,negative,where to start cgi was acceptable for such production i would expect much more blurriness was always there the movie could have been 1hour less with proper slow mo it has the slow motion of all the matrix 300 and all the max payne games combined acting mediocre the protagonist was one of the worse so that doesnt help the rest of the cast didnt do any favors too scenario meh i think these are more than enough to not have to go even further
Jan 12 2024,negative,the story was bad the accents annoying and the camera work could have been a lot better
Jan 12 2024,negative,horrible movie feels like it should have been a tv show tries to hard to be something special and was very boring
Jan 12 2024,negative,visually stunning but mainly terrible very poor character development clash with a story that has been told a hundred times before
Jan 12 2024,negative,i really wanted to like this film i love zss other films for the most part this turned out to be such a poorly conceived story and production that i am writing this review at the 2 hr mark because i just cant take it anymore this is painful to watch casting was good but the acting direction is all over the place sets had visual flair but theres just so much nonsense going on that its distracting whatever made zss other films so good is clearly missing from this production watchmen and 300 were incredible films zss dc films were good sucker punch missed the mark and on that same level this film did the same characters are contrived this is poorly written i cant believe how much i dislike a film i really wanted to love
Jan 12 2024,neutral,felt rushed and disjointed no depth to any of the characters or the places visited visually stunning and great idea behind the movie just poorly executed
Jan 12 2024,positive,loved it its hard not to love an epic spacescifi movie with sofia boutella in the lead every movie cant start out with an enormous budget the size of a modern day star warsmarvelavatar movie the critics will look for imperfections in the details like always but in the end theres only one thing about a movie that truly mattersare you not entertained
Jan 12 2024,negative,not good not good at all it felt like a jumbled mess of little bits of other movies
Jan 12 2024,negative,i finished this film more confused than i began perhaps it is my own ignorance but i couldnt identify a halfway decent motivation  behind a single characters actions we were bombarded with characters and information without the slightest attempt at explaining or expanding on any of it   the main character barley exchanged two words with half her team mates and they were convinced to join her  not to mention the shoddy patchwork of scifi clichés it felt gimmicky at best and just embarrassing at worst i hope part two will wrap up the many loose ends but oof
Jan 12 2024,positive,i dont get the trashing this movie has received its wonderful fantastic even feels like a space opera and harkens back to that classic serialized feel thats full of nostalgia add great effects score and solid acting youve got a wonderful thing going here loved it
Jan 11 2024,negative,this was so bad it was laughable i wish i had the sense enough to turn it off earlier but i kept thinking it had to get better we deserve better i didnt care about a single character the stupid villain trying to get the villagers grain lol the manipulative slowmotion action the terrible acting who thought it was a good idea to blatantly rip off so many great films from the past and smash them together in one big glossfest with no emotional connection we are not 12 years old
Jan 11 2024,positive,this movie definitely deserves 4 stars its different and some very good special effects and i enjoyed it
Jan 11 2024,positive,was disappointed  this seemed to be a homage toremake of the magnificent 7  7 samurai  it is stilted and looked like a series if storyboards put together to address the 7 samurai plot    did not justify the hype  can only hope part 2 will have a more original plot and continuity
Jan 11 2024,positive,it was ok but introduced an overwhelming  amount of characters very quickly so you really dont get invested into this world all action and little substance  the action is great so kind of a fun watch
Jan 11 2024,positive,i dont understand the hate was it amazing eh lol but i know a bad movie and this isnt is lol it felt like star wars which this was pitched by synder to lucas film before disney bought them i enjoyed the movie its pretty much free give it a watch im looking forward to part 2 
Jan 11 2024,negative,bad acting from all maybe its the script but i felt nothing for anyone bad guy is not bad enough and we all know a good villain makes a good movie
Jan 11 2024,neutral,hodge podge of various scifi movies nothing original and no character development even down to the cantina star wars scene and jax solo entertaining enough to watch but far from good
Jan 11 2024,positive,great movie cant wait for part 2
Jan 11 2024,positive,visually stunning and great acting
Jan 11 2024,negative,poor story line horrible graphics below average production
Jan 10 2024,negative,too sad to never watch something as bad as this
Jan 10 2024,negative,no means to insult 12 year olds but this feels like the definition of made by a 12 year old the script and dialog is just horrible the cinematography overuses so many tropes including in the wrong places it feels like a movie where somebody just got 166m to make whatever their want and that whatever wasnt very good
Jan 10 2024,positive,not even close to a bad film but the cut scenes are obvious great world building that is enhanced with pretty visuals and led by a strong performance by sofia boutella despite pacing issues and more development needed for the rest of the rebels rebel moon is a great start for the part 1 of zacks new space fantasy tale
Jan 10 2024,negative,the visual effects are good that is where it ends you can tell the makers have trolls writing good reviews because there is nothing good about this movie the actors are ok but the writing is so poor you never care about their stories they are comic book characters with poor links between chapters i felt like i was watching a video game where you advance to the next level once a key was found and there was no connection between the levels the writing is so poor i watch hundreds of movies and this is top 5 in my worst movies ever made i am sure part 2 will make it there also save 90 minutes of your life and avoid this disaster
Jan 10 2024,negative,the movie could be like an hour shorter if you cut out all the unnecessary slomo that is way over used here character development felt rushed or completely nonexistent story was literally just a worse version of samurai 7 watch that instead
Jan 10 2024,positive,good movie better than half the marvel poop comming out
Jan 10 2024,negative,a 2 hour snooze fest that was so poorly written and hard to watch that i made an account for this review it will leave you wanting to throw rocks at your tv for it to be over but you feel obligated to continue because you already watched an hour of this nonsense talk about cliches no character development and scenes that look like a computer wallpaper dangerously unenjoyable
Jan 10 2024,negative,a poorly executed  indifferently acted version of the magnificent 7 just awful echoes of star wars mad max and numerous other sci fifantasy movies almost as if it had been written by ai incredibly average special effects i couldnt find anything to like
Jan 10 2024,negative,spoilers ahead    there was nothing original in this movie i love 300 and am a huge star wars fan so went in with an open mind but this movie was seven samuraimagnificent seven set in the star war universe with gamora from marvel as the main character koras backstory is exactly gamoras girl on a planet that is slaughtered by a megalomaniac she is spared adopted and raised by said megalomaniac becomes a super soldier and then decides to fight against her adoptive father they even had an actor from gladiator portray a general who was betrayed and ended up in a gladiator fighting pit in a coliseum     i actually really wanted to like this movie but it was so unoriginal and had so little character development that i just couldnt get into it     it only really got my attention with the last shot of the anthony hopkins robot wearing the antler crown i doubt ill watch part two but ill at least read the wikipedia plot synopsis to see what that was all about
Jan 9 2024,negative,boring pointless shallow and a waste of time
Jan 9 2024,negative,so so so so bad it made me angry never rated anything here first time now gave 05 star cause i cant give it any less
Jan 9 2024,negative,zach synder has reached the limit of his potential and should not be allowed to make any more movies he is a one trick pony with slow motion and it now looks horrible i love sci fi but this is shallow zero character depth huge story holes its really one of the worst movies i have seen in some time
Jan 9 2024,positive,its shallow and a bit unrealistic but there are moments that dazzle and those are worth seeing its an entertaining enough two hours
Jan 9 2024,negative,i was really looking forward to seeing this dont get me wrong the visuals were amazing but i really dont know what they were trying to do with the plot it was just a mixture of different scifi films with way too much slow motion
Jan 9 2024,negative,i find more plot cohesion and character development in my six year old recapping his half remembered dreams from the night before i truly cannot believe how utterly empty this movie is for all its bells and whistles
Jan 9 2024,negative,bad acting ridiculous dialogues unappealing characters etc the list goes on just cliché af one star only coz the visual is amazing
Jan 9 2024,negative,completely void of any content oh wait the droid was kinda interesting too bad it wasnt in most of the movie
Jan 9 2024,negative,what was that why did i expect so much from this director whose only good work was  300 not going to waste my time on him
Jan 9 2024,negative,horrible horrible film
Jan 9 2024,negative,predicable cliched unoriginal garbage
Jan 9 2024,negative,this movie has to be one of the worst movies of the decade i cannot believe people actually have this movie a good review horrible acting and the plot made zero sense what a waste of two hours i would rather watch paint dry wow
Jan 9 2024,positive,best science fiction movie i have seen in a long time
Jan 9 2024,positive,this movie was great and im sure the extended directors cut will only add on to improve this beautifully stunning sci fi space opera
Jan 9 2024,negative,the ridiculous ninjasamurai lady and the native american hawk whisperer had me in utter disbelief the fact perdonpeople got paid to write this nonsensical jargon is shocking please stop any more production immediately rewrite it and do it over only this time write it for people who can actually process a few smallcomplex ideas such as turn left or turn right or push the green button 
Jan 9 2024,positive,this movie is so very underrated i think its quite good is it star wars nope vut its still pretty good
Jan 9 2024,positive,i went it with almost no expectations and i loved the movie forget what it was originally supposed to be and who made it and just watch a great scifi revenge movie
Jan 8 2024,negative,just as bad as i thought bad acting unispired characters awful villain terrible story if i tried to make a more generic scifi movie i couldnt oh and the slow mo shots wtf is that terrible movie deserves every single bad review it got
Jan 8 2024,positive,i enjoyed the cinematography plot most characters and the visual escape for a couple of hours its only part one so i expect that the whole will be better
Jan 8 2024,positive,loved this story just refreshing aand exciting to watch great characters visuals and story yes starwars esc and 300 but still great
Jan 8 2024,positive,the dialog is the biggest weak point and most of the characters are a bit shallow however the visuals the atmosphere and overall feeling of this movie are awesome the world and the story have a lot of potential and make it worth to watch   im looking forward to see what part 2 does with this stunning world
Jan 8 2024,negative,what a disappointment i only watched because of snyders name on it and time wasted successfully
Jan 8 2024,positive,i loved the visuals and action scenes the art style is great as are all of zack snyders movies that is the reason im giving it 4 stars i came in expecting it to be pretty and fun to watch the story and dialogue wasnt good but i knew it wasnt going to be this movie entertained me enough to want to see the next one
Jan 8 2024,positive,have to admit it this way i actually loved this film i know some negative reviews are trying to be harshly against the film because it was inspired by seven samurai and most other types of films but honestly which other films havent been that way before this however is definitely not a ripoff of star wars at all it is a completely different story compared to star wars it appears such expectations were too high with not enough open minds to take it all in differently at least i went into this film just open minded lowering my expectations without nit picking on parts of it like i used to because i enjoyed this for what it is and thats that its only a story to setup more happening in part 2 which made total sense rebel moon part 2 the scargiver needs to hurry up though because it will truly explain a lot more and go deeper this is part 1 after all its a twoparter type of film and patience is the key to slowpaced films like this hopefully more installments take place after
Jan 8 2024,negative,this was a mess beautiful visually but the plot pacing characters etc are all painfully boring i really wanted to like this but its some of the worst sci fi ive ever seen
Jan 8 2024,positive,visually stunning a good story and great ensemble of actors its everything the new star wars movies should be this is the start of a big franchise
Jan 8 2024,negative,i really wanted to like this film there has been a desire among older star wars fans to see something more grown up this should have been it but sadly no whether it be the numb and pointless story or the flat and weird characters  rebel moon is a grab bag of pure awful   i also cannot understand the decision by a streaming service to offer a recut of a movie before its even out  other than to somehow use it as a gimmick to earn more views im not wasting more time watching an alternate cut when this has already been a truly rubbish viewing experience  i need to go watch rewatch andor to get this terrible taste out of my mouth
Jan 8 2024,positive,i kept an open mind understanding that there will be a part 2 that will complete the whole movie  i thought the action sequence was great
Jan 8 2024,positive,the movie is entertaining the effects are good the story could be better but that could be said about many scifi movies looking forward to part 2
Jan 8 2024,negative,it was really beautiful and completely devoid of anything worth your time did you feel like a bugs life needed more sexual assault then this might be for you
Jan 8 2024,positive,good start to the franchise looking forward to the other movies and for more context and characters
Jan 8 2024,neutral,i liked the action scenes the characters need more backstory and dimension this concept has some real promise but the rushed pace makes me wonder if this woulda been a better episodic tv show rather than a movie if you wanna shut off your brain for a couple of hours its a fun ride without much to think about and zero surprises due to lots of clunky telegraphing that said the worldbuilding is uglybeautiful i like some eye candy in my science fiction and this flick has lots of gorgeous backdrop with a wellworn livedin authenticity i could practically taste and smell if only the storytelling had kept that kind of genuine flavor
Jan 8 2024,negative,so boring and the the film did not make sense at all
Jan 8 2024,negative,i watched one episode and i was done not interested
Jan 8 2024,positive,fantastic from beginning to end
Jan 7 2024,positive,i cant believe how astounding this movie is and yet how many bad reviews it has received it does follow the seven samuraithe magnificent seven set up i love how it has that spaghetti western grittiness to it but that it also has a slower pace in storytelling watching this movie made me feel like i was reading a good novel the flashes of reveals in koras past the mystery over who killed the royal family the glimpses of how the imperium does things it is so rich in cultures in its storybased universe    i will say now that i am a huge star wars fan and i am happy to see another space opera coming out so others comparing it to star wars and are angry that it is not star wars need to chill this is a different story     the cgi is smooth and enjoyed seeing the styles of the spaceships i am so happy to see a griffin loved that part and loved the fight scenes  kora can kick serious butt    but anyway despite what the haters say rebel moon is a good movie with plenty of intrigue lots of fights and its story has a beginning middle and an end that promises continuance into movie 2 yes the plot is familiar because it is a scifi version of the seven samurai yes we know what is going to happen next but i simple cant wait for part 2 and see what other twists zack synder comes up with
Jan 7 2024,negative,no original plot dismal dialogue mostly terrible cgi tired action scenes the dialogue is so bad that its laughable and not even experienced actors can save it if i see another damned slomo fight scene im gonna wanna gouge my eyes out what a mess
Jan 7 2024,positive,23 rotten tomatoes how why it was amazing i cant wait for part 2 way better than star wars well done
Jan 7 2024,negative,even though it has its visual stunning moments all of that eye candy gets lost in a pile of inconsistent narrative
Jan 7 2024,negative,some of it looked nice so theres that    everything after leaving the farm was a mess and the farm doesnt even make sense     its derivative and nonsensical offers nothing new i really hoped the professional critics were wrong they were not
Jan 7 2024,positive,the plot has its weak spots but cinematography is great and if you have a fully equipped surround sound with powerful base your whole room shakes and rumbles i look forward to the second part even though i wished for a different ending no spoilers
Jan 7 2024,negative,it looked nice thats it  awful script and acting  rehashed boring story so many plot issues  costumes copied from 40k  anticlimactic final fighti assumed there was more coming  but we watched it all and occasionally there was a nice side on shot  bonus star for anthony hopkins robot
Jan 7 2024,negative,best viewed with a scifi trope bingo card and an understanding that you wont be shown but you will be told anthony hopkins is the best part of this and i hope he gets more screen time in the sequel watch ut on a sunday afternoon in a food coma
Jan 7 2024,positive,solid scifi soooo happy they didnt give rebel moon the star wars treatment where in a an attempt to appeal to everyone it excites no one  i liked it looking forward to next installment
Jan 7 2024,positive,well its probably like or dont like with this one i found it entertaining and am curious for the 2nd part
Jan 7 2024,negative,no plot and the movie is all over the place
Jan 7 2024,negative,this is what happens when corporations with a corporate director decide that they can make money on garbage like this absolutely underwritten underacted over produced and hollow you will not care for characters its just a smashed together mess of slow motion fabric to emphasize drama because all other aspects are lacking
Jan 7 2024,positive,good film nice action and setting the scene for what i hope is an ongoing franchise
Jan 7 2024,negative,this movie shows how to waste money on generic plot   costium design was just bad another evil character in nazi uniform another asian character with sword rebels looking like vacnda forever  rest is just rip off from better movies we have star wars here harry potter the last mohican and gladiator  i knew this film will be bad but still i was surprised how bad it was
Jan 7 2024,positive,rebel moon part 1 has some good visuals and passable performances from the cast there was also a clear attempt to take the worldbuilding seriously which i appreciate and it didnt go down the marvel route of forcing inane jokes and zaniness on the audience every ten seconds in case boredom sets in these desperate attempts at humour are often the most boring part however thats all the praise i can give the film wouldve benefited a lot if the characters had more presence and personality as few of them stood out as memorable at one point theres a supposedly emotional moment where one of the good guys heroically sacrifices himself but it has little impact given that we know nothing about him and his personality is 100 interchangeable with several other characters  the story feel formulaic at times  go to planet recruit another hero dump some exposition rinse repeat  and theres nothing in the plot you wont have seen at least a hundred times before so this movie doesnt have anything that marks it out as excellent but it passes the time amiably enough if you dont expect too much from it
Jan 7 2024,positive,loved every bit of it
Jan 7 2024,positive,nice sunday movie enjoyed it and looking forward to part 2
Jan 7 2024,positive,great scifi movie with good action
Jan 7 2024,positive,i would have liked to see the main characters fleshed out a little bit more but an enjoyable movie nonetheless great action scenes and it sets the stage for more to come i am looking forward to the next movie
Jan 7 2024,negative,too much slow motion in inappropriate paces
Jan 7 2024,negative,i really wanted to like this movie and i really enjoyed the first 25 minutes but after they left the farm it became and absolute drag theres nothing redeeming even though its glorious to look at but you just simply dont care about whats going on
Jan 7 2024,positive,fantastic space western edgier than star wars some room for more character growth but otherwise loved it
Jan 7 2024,positive,fast paced villans done well looking forward to part 2
Jan 7 2024,positive,awesome sci fi movie refreshing to see something different people need to stop nitpicking and enjoy the ride
Jan 7 2024,negative,i cant believe so much wasted money could go into such a horrible predictable pick up quest of a movie  dont even get me started on the slow moor the accents i wont name names
Jan 7 2024,negative,this one evil guy just wont die very annoying
Jan 7 2024,positive,entertaining enough good visuals  reasonable plot twist
Jan 7 2024,negative,rebel moon was absolutely terrible copious amounts of slow motion just everywhere the acting was on par with the room setting farming planet where people are dressed like theyre from the 1800s even though space travel and laser guns are everywhere space nazis land and demand most of their harvest but these space pig farmers are ready for a fight queue in a space samurai for dramatic effect its an absolute disaster caught on film with an all star cast like strong female role walgreens brand hugh jackman and anthony hopkins robot strap in for rebel moon written by a five year old on monster with an ai bot
Jan 7 2024,positive,it is good some things i think could have been cut and or replace some of the stuff was predictable
Jan 6 2024,negative,seriously one of the worst movies ever made
Jan 6 2024,positive,all the one star ratings gave me low expectations  to my pleasant surprise the movie was better than expected and i will definitely watch part 2 i  want to thank all those one star negative reviewers too bad you didnt like it 
Jan 6 2024,positive,i liked the start  and the general outline of the story but film probably needed to be longer for more character development for us to have a connection to the characters and there fate at the end and main character her actor lacked any gravitas when she was trying to show anger or inspiration
Jan 6 2024,positive,zach out lucass george lucas in this moviecant wait until the r rated version is released
Jan 6 2024,negative,boring was expecting so much more the visuals were fantastic but this was star wars a new hope in everything but name only i was so looking forward to seeing the movie pity
Jan 6 2024,positive,i wasnt sure what to expect but i enjoyed it curious to see what they do with part 2
Jan 6 2024,positive,visually stunning and a very fun watch plan for an intermission 12 way through cant wait to see part 2
Jan 6 2024,positive,amazing unsure why so many bad reviews great film great action scenes emotional deserves a much higher rating than it has
Jan 6 2024,negative,cinematography is great but the writing and storyline is soooo bad they really needed someone to editclean up this draft before it went to production the dialogue is weird and cringe just overall a bad film and we really dont need a part 2  3 
Jan 6 2024,negative,i could only stomach the first 20 minutes that was too long to do that to myself and i convinced chatgpt wrote the script
Jan 6 2024,negative,great visuals albeit way too much slomo some nice scifi designs but a plot so thin it hardly counts as a story and not a drop of character development   zack is great a visuals but not a good writer or storyteller because he never spends time between action scenes to get us to care
Jan 6 2024,positive,story is awesome characters are great and the movie looks fantastic  possibly best movie i saw this year and one of snyders best so far as well  excited for part 2 to come
Jan 6 2024,negative,the script feels like it was written by ai so messy
Jan 6 2024,negative,fx were good but just about every other aspect of the movie the story the characters the gratuitous use of slowmo were bad
Jan 6 2024,positive,thats so epic wow 
Jan 6 2024,positive,honestly just alright dont think its as bad as people say and also not as incredible as what was promised it lacked a lot of character development but it was truly an assemble the team movie that included a lot of exposition i think good things can come from this ip it just needs some time
Jan 6 2024,negative,just alright terrible acting
Jan 6 2024,positive,it is a nice popcorn cinema the first part ist mostly buliding charakters and a preparation for the second part nothing wrong with it
Jan 6 2024,negative,the dialogues i just cant where are the real writers of hollywood
Jan 6 2024,positive,i really enjoyed this movie it feels rare to see this level of world building in movies and especially world building done fairly well the film did an excellent job showing rather than telling and the characters felt like pivot points on a web connecting and expanding the universe i am excited for the next in the series
Jan 6 2024,negative,if i had one good thing to say about this movie i would put it here
Jan 6 2024,negative,huge fan of the genre but the movie was boring and often nonsensical the acting was poor too
Jan 6 2024,negative,cliched  trite  overworked  if you want to watch a bad star wars then watch anything after return of the jedi  even they do better than this
Jan 6 2024,positive,this movie is badass i love space and the ass kicking i hope in the next movie or whatever the good guys win space is dope the aliens are hot
Jan 6 2024,negative,ive never seen a worse film to the credit of this film  not only is every scene a joyless exposition dump or a slo motion fight youve seen 100 times now but many of the elements most bad movies do ok on are also done terribly here the cinematography is bad the cgi is all over the place the dialog is horrendous and most of the scifi or fantasy elements are very very obviously ripped from dune or star wars you would think that if you got the chance to make a scifi and fantasy universe youd make your own original things but nope the bad guys are a mix of nazis and warhammer 40k there are griffins and most of the plot is just a terrible and boring assembly trying to mimic seven samurai     diarrhea is a better time than this
Jan 6 2024,negative,story line was weak  im surprised they made this movie
Jan 6 2024,negative,if some kid wrote a movie using scenes from their favorite films you would come out with something better than this seriously the story is stolen from star wars battlestar galactica the seven samurai and every version ever made including a bugs life road warrior furious road harry potter pirates of the caribbean  anastasia and so forth then you do slow motion in every battle scene you have zero backstory for any of the character so you cant name them or care when they die and a lot of how convenient twists come up with ridiculous plot twists like an interstellar battle dreadnaught is brought down with a hand spear and so forth and so on sheesh oh and focus focus
Jan 6 2024,negative,disjointed rambling rutterless a very very poor attempt at trying to steal then sniff lucas junkstrap   soo thousands  thousands of people died in a misguided effort to save 50 meaningless farmers lead by a small band of misfits who all met in like a day and risked their lives for free i was so incensed i actually signed up for rotten tomatoes just to save another life from wasting over twohours of their lives scratching their head over this drivel it seemed to have a decent budget mostly wasted on endless slomo when they should have hired some decent writers  this is not the scifi youre looking for
Jan 6 2024,positive,great production and performances by the cast but it seems so unnecessarily rushed and a mishmash of some pretty tired scifi tropes
Jan 6 2024,negative,bad acting boring and predictable story and overall just dumb not worth watching
Jan 6 2024,positive,not sure what the haters dislike about it most of them seem to think it fails in comparison to star wars which is one of the most overrated storylines in sci fi movie history an enjoyable 2 hours with a clear beginning middle and third act
Jan 6 2024,negative,cheesy dialogue which couldnt even be pulled off by the great actors involved storyline was nonsensical like they tried to cram a whole miniseries into 2 hours might have been a little better if i had known the entire story before watching because they didnt give you enough story to understand what was going on fancy computer enhanced fight scenes does not a movie make
Jan 6 2024,positive,a great movie one of the best ive seen on the last ten years a must see for everyone
Jan 5 2024,positive,have some issues but i really liked
Jan 5 2024,positive,painful to get into it overdone in my humble opinion but not the typical type of show id go for found it worth time spent in the end
Jan 5 2024,positive,if you liked the movie 300 you will like this film too i enjoyed the movie and am looking forward to the sequel and directors cut
Jan 5 2024,negative,some of the worst writing and acting i have ever seen in a highly advertised movie worst movie i have seen in close to 10 years
Jan 5 2024,negative,its so stupid you cant enjoy it and despite what people say about synder this movie does not look good cardboard sets everywhere the rest is just slomo fights slomo farming slomo walking slomo
Jan 5 2024,negative,sadly i had high hopes for this movie iflt had parts that were very cool then parts that bored me to tears the scripted needed a rewrite and it could of been awsome ohh well i will skip part too
Jan 5 2024,positive,at first i was hesitant but not too hesitant so i had decided to check this movie and see it for myself unlike some people who are too far in negativity and listen to just critics all the time these days movies dont have to be perfect oscar worthy or anything close but this one was really good to see im not sure what these 1 star low rating people were expecting at all you expect almost too much and then youll never like it probably not going to enjoy anything thats a simple movie i went into it with lower expectations and it paid off cant wait for part 2 haters gona hate but not me or many others around yeah 
Jan 5 2024,negative,such a disjointed sluggish boring mess the title should be called and then because its just a bunch of random flashy lights stitched together devoid of charm characters or personality i really wanted to love this movie but was so disappointed
Jan 5 2024,negative,i watched the film in its entirety but it wasnt a movie worth wasting popcorn on    the beginning of the movie kept me engaged but it lost me later on overall rebel moon has boring and unimaginative characters dialogue and plot topped with poor pacing and an overuse of slow motion i feel as though the worldbuilding has some potential and despite my rating im interested on how the sequel will turn out
Jan 5 2024,positive,this is a great way to kill boredom for a couple of hours  is it oscar worthy  no  do i care no  liked it fine
Jan 5 2024,positive,lets not forget this was originally pitched as a star wars movie so move past the obvious parallels and see it for what it is yes its obviously derivative reread my previous sentence but its an impressive attempt to move beyond being rejected by the franchise and carry on regardless and sofia boutella is absolutely awesome in it yes the empire have been replaced by half arsed nazi knockoffs and the back story is never adequately explained but the action set pieces are really well executed i really dont get the complaints about the amount of exposition i cant say i noticed it being particularly dry and if youre world building some context is necessary there are some ropey characters that let it down a bit but overall this was enjoyable and the trailer for part 2 looks even better
Jan 5 2024,positive,absolutely loved it so many negative reviews nearly put me off i sat back watched it with zero expectation and thoroughly enjoyed it for something with so many inspirations and an obvious plot i honestly could wait to move from scene to scene i think the fact it doesnt try to hide the story or the influences oddly gives it the freedom to be its own thing     great bit of shameless fantasy in space i think some people forget what makes a movie great
Jan 5 2024,negative,i dont know  it has potential but the antagonists were a bit derivative
Jan 5 2024,negative,dreadful forgettable incomprehensible i know what this film wants to be but unfortunately the film does not and struggles to be even a mediocre star wars rip off i mean battle beyond the stars the roger corman star wars rip from 1980 is an absolute master piece compared to rebel moon this is not a rebellion worth joining
Jan 5 2024,positive,tentpoles of an idea with no actual story and rushed to conclude early with an unsatisfying ending you spend the whole time waiting for a storyline that never comes the movie started with a cheesy but perhaps promising premise and went downhill fast the use of freeze and slow effects were annoying and contributed nothing the new character introductions were set across all different genres including western and roman and were timed exactly as they were completing some heroic action strangely with no normal human reactions from the other people present but they were cliche and predictable even the epic speeches were so cheesy it was painful and nevermind their motivations everyone signing up with no money or incentive was just ridiculous and not thought out at all each scene seemed intended to push the story along as quickly as possible to get to the main battle with this elite super special team but they shut the end of the story down early with the suddenness of a film that ran out of time or budget it didnt leave any kind of cliffhanger or arc to give the disappointed viewer any interest in the next film i havent watched a film this bad in a long time
Jan 5 2024,positive,not the best but definitely not the worst movie ive ever seen story needs more depth and the characters stories were not as intriguing as they couldve been but i will watch part 2 when it comes out
Jan 5 2024,negative,poor story a cliche
Jan 5 2024,negative,from the very first seconds of the movie we can understand that it is going to be a total absurd 20 farmers on a moon plowing soil using horselike animals no electricity no robots no gadgets and they trade their crop to intergalactic rebellion with spaceships warpdrives and stuff   acting dialogue and the scrips at its weakest superslomotion is annoying and absolutely unnecessary
Jan 5 2024,positive,entertaining scifi action
Jan 5 2024,positive,derivative yes entertaining yes
Jan 5 2024,negative,terrible absolutely
Jan 5 2024,negative,easily the worst big budget  scfi  action movie ive watched in my opinion there was no character development which meant  i didnt care about any of the characters throughout the film there were many slow motion scenes throughout the movie relating to character moments suggesting those scenes were meant to be poignant and suggesting the audience should feel something for the character in that moment but i never did in stead of world building i would say it was simple location building given nothing was explained about the different planets the movie introduced maybe a movie that would have worked with way more character development or before gathering the hero team together each character had already had there own movie to fully establish there past and audience cared about who they are endured and would bring to a team i didnt think much of the cgi where most of the movie appeared to have been shot on a green screen stage and everything looked flat lastly the movie stakes is one ship threatening a farm hamlet of maybe fifty inhabitants  as seen in the movie not really the type of stakes i was expecting of a scfi movie pitched in the trailers as having a galactic enemy the empire    the movie was just awful
Jan 5 2024,neutral,it will never be an epic but this movie is not 1 star or 24 google users give it 77 likes a bit to high but this movie is a solid 25 to 3 stars 5066 nice special effects decent acting good story but script could use way more work we will see what the part 2 will bring sometimes i wonder if the professional reviewers are high or just blind good thing that these days i rather trust goigle reviews than some stucked up reviewer
Jan 5 2024,negative,whoa what an absolute stinker of a movie there is no sense even going into it i dont want to think about this movie anymore brain just move that 2 hours to repressed childhood memories thank you very much
Jan 5 2024,positive,i love this movie im want to see the second part
Jan 5 2024,neutral,this first installment was rushed  and probably should have been a ten show season  as it is the characters jumped from place to place having brief encounters with others only to jump to the next location frankly they could have filled in a lot more activity at each location and given the characters more heft  as it is it is passable  the general story arc is good enough that if they had taken the 2 hour show and instead produced 10 1 hour installments eg a full season of shows this could have been an excellent tale
Jan 5 2024,positive,it was enjoyable you can tell this is the setupget the band together installment this is not a star wars movie if you are expecting that youll be disappointed     if you like scifi youll enjoy this can you pick it apart if you want to just sit back and enjoy this for what it is a new scifi world with characters i hope they expand on
Jan 5 2024,negative,this movie is like watching a drunk toddler try to explain star wars
Jan 5 2024,positive,must watch cannot wait for the superior version
Jan 5 2024,negative,half way into it and its ok the dei characters makes me think this is a disney movie pretty lame this is not like a true star wars movie maybe similar to 7 8  9 but those were garbage even this better than those
Jan 5 2024,negative,this movie takes the worst of many scifi tropes and ruins them forever is there any original ideas left in hollywood how did this movie ever get made see seven samurais and view the masterpiece in its original form i hope part two never gets released
Jan 5 2024,negative,this movie borrows far to much from other sci fi movies although it had a lot of potential it didnt reach expectations its beginning is strong to build a world but it loses all sense once they reach the 30 minute mark if you really still want to watch a movie like it watch star warsalso i really hope that the second part can redeem this movie
Jan 5 2024,positive,its part 1 its all build up but anyone who knows the story of the seven samurai know what they are watching incredible movie looking forward to part 2
Jan 5 2024,positive,read the bad reviews and watched it anyway  i enjoyed it and it was nice to see something relatively original and i look forward to part2
Jan 4 2024,negative,a movie with an interesting universe but absolutely horrendous pacing it feels as if someone wrote a season script for a tv series then took the footage and concenced it into a feature length film the action is solid but also ludicrous     i am not watching part ii but if they make a tv show set in this universe i might take another look at the universe on offer
Jan 4 2024,positive,splendid visuals asperous yet beguiling music grounded characters medieval yet very grandiose atmosphere decent plot 1010
Jan 4 2024,negative,i dont understand how anyone could enjoy this movie its just a bunch of recycled scenes from other bad blockbuster movies there are tons of plot holes and thats saying something because the movie barely has a plot to begin with
Jan 4 2024,positive,i think the movie delivers what it promised the story in this first part of rebel moon is somewhat shallow but filled with good intentions anime and science fiction enthusiasts will be thrilled by the breathtaking scenes    the visuals truly captivate offering a feast for the eyes the characters while not deeply explored in this installment show potential for growth and complexity in future parts of the series the film successfully captures the essence of both anime and scifi genres creating a visually stunning experience that resonates with fans    however a more intricate plot development could enhance the overall storytelling despite its current simplicity the film sets the stage for potential expansion in subsequent installments the combination of stunning visuals and the promise of deeper narratives leaves audiences eager for what comes next in the rebel moon series
Jan 4 2024,negative,felt like watching an episode of mediocre star wars bootleg that dont deliver failed to deliver emotion under average choreography lazy writing
Jan 4 2024,positive,great movie almost like dune but more action
Jan 4 2024,positive,full throttle sci fi epic movie that manages to actually have a great story wonderful characters actors that make them seem real and special effects that enhance the cinematic experience rather than overwhelm it  i know there are a lot comparisons to stars wars however to me this is much better and a little more akin to the the expanse  my only disappointment is only two movies really would have liked to have a one time eight to ten episode mini series where the story could delve deeper
Jan 4 2024,positive,visually striking and powerful the world building and introduction to all of the characters and their unique personalities abilities and pasts was perfect meanwhile also telling and moving through the story the pacing was very smooth     the creatures as they travelled to the different moons in search of other rebels were intense beautiful and one of them rather spine chilling at first glance harmada but in a way i also felt for her too to be scared but also sympathize is something the directions did very well here     i have to admit my favourite scene was a beautiful moment that made me tear up between jimmy and sam by the river when he was telling her about princess issa how she reminded him of her and you could see how broken he was that he was not able to protect issa in the way he was programmed to as she was killed the way sam sat completely immersed in what he was saying but also making a flower crown from daisies and placed them on his head it melted something inside of him she showed him warmth and kindness and i think in the future films  film he will be sams biggest protector     a really beautiful and visually dazzling movie filled with action but also holds these delicate moments where you really fall in love with the characters 
Jan 4 2024,negative,i normally enjoy science fiction even bad science fiction i was expecting to enjoy this but it wasbad the script and dialog are just horrible its disjointed and just feels really pointless its like the worst parts of the modern star wars movies but with any remaining charm sucked out the characters are incredibly one dimensional it just feels like a scifi movie designed by an ai
Jan 4 2024,negative,nothing short of a disaster
Jan 4 2024,negative,shut it off after 30 minutes i was rolling my eyes at ham fisted characters poor character decisions and cliche tropes im not interested in wasting my time on poorly written shows anymore
Jan 4 2024,positive,interesting characters good pacing yes its kinda sorta like star wars but that is not necessarily bad it kept me awake which 95 of movies i watch do not i have watched many well reviewed bad movies this is a poorly reviewed good one
Jan 4 2024,positive,rebel moon looks absolutely fantastic however it feels like somebody put all scifi tropes in an ai blender and this movie is what came out
Jan 4 2024,positive,a bit heavy handed and too many girl bosses but otherwise pretty funbetter than disney era star wars
Jan 4 2024,positive,visually stunning lacking depth see where 2 goes
Jan 4 2024,negative,seriously the writing is rubbish and the story is pathetic this needs some serious work
Jan 4 2024,negative,to be brutally honest this is by far the most badly and lazily written plot ive seen in a while with some of the most underwhelming character development to ever serve as contrast for other films    the very obvious copy paste writing of too many elements from other movies that dont make sense was the absolute worst    visual effects and actions scenes were okay
Jan 4 2024,negative,unethical garbage not only is it one of the worst written things to have been conceived in quite some time but its also unabashedly unethical in how it excessively plagiarizes others works and how it presents itself as a movies as a service
Jan 4 2024,positive,looks like people just want to bash the director than watch the movie the movie is entertaining its a space adventure movie people talk about pacing and editing its not that hard to follow people its a fun entertaining movie thats all it is to it 
Jan 4 2024,negative,boring and dragged out awful acting
Jan 4 2024,positive,its like star wars for people who dont need forced cute product placement
Jan 4 2024,positive,overall i thought it was a really good movie  worth watching an alternative to starwars
Jan 4 2024,negative,not only was this a sad attempt to replicate star wars it was a waste of time and money for everyone involved the dialogue is a joke the characters are shallow and the cgi looks like it wasnt fully developed or finished not to mention the random slomo moments during fight scenes render any seriousness completely ridiculous at first i thought this was based on a video game because the amount of lore dumping in this is insane however impressively enough despite the dumping you spend the entire movie wondering what the hell is going on im giving this half a star because it wont let me give it no stars but honestly it deserves half a start for impressing me with its cataclysm of confusing plot line
Jan 4 2024,negative,formulaic sci fi garbage bored me enough that i didnt even finish it
Jan 4 2024,negative,i believe someone lost a bet and had to make the worst movie possible it needed to come with those three dudes sitting in front of it from mystery science theater horrible acting dialogue was beyond stupid terrible music the fight scenes make wwe look realistic other than that its great
Jan 4 2024,negative,pooooooooor script too much slow motion zero charisma  too bad for charlie hunnam totally wastedhe deserves better movies
Jan 4 2024,negative,if you want to see this movie good luck enjoying it worst movie of the year
Jan 4 2024,negative,this movie had so much potential but it wasted it the basis for the plot isthe big empire from earth goes to the outer planets to find some rebels and harassers a small farming village of like 40 people the farmers go out to find other people who want to defend them from the empire which is the majority of the movie going to location and picking up people my whole issue with it is that the people they pickup are just some randos with no story and no reason to join helping these few farmers when they have nothing to give them as a reward the whole plot is dumb  what they could of done is make the movie into an exponential plot which keeps increasing the scope like gurren lagann  help a farm save a city defend a planet galaxy at war
Jan 4 2024,positive,look its not a cult or a classic weve all seen the plotlines before it is though a great mindless bit of very well executed sci fi drama ed skrein in particular puts in a gloriously ott performance as the archetypal sadistic villain its just entertainment folks fast paced and punchy the over harsh critics need to see this film while wearing the right glasses perhaps they can be excused as the film does occasionally vear towards delusional pretensions of grandiosity if you ignore this you are left with a terrific action adventure to settle down into and enjoy
Jan 3 2024,positive,great movie the only thing i didnt like was the slo no action scenes way too many of them of overall good film
Jan 3 2024,negative,this was a hard watch personally im a huge fan of fantasy scifi films but this was a struggle the dialogue was like a copypaste version from other films of the style the slomo shots were too long too many and unnecessary what worked well in 300 doesnt work here the theme of explaining who people are was painful to sit through unlikely to bother with the sequel
Jan 3 2024,negative,this movie sucked tbh
Jan 3 2024,negative,a movie to define the word bland
Jan 3 2024,negative,this film felt as if it were just a collection of action sequences interspersed with lackluster dialog the plot was one that has been seen a thousand times before and the visuals that cost so much money fluctuated between mediocre and downright awful some cgi felt akin to cutscenes from a decade old video game much like the hobbit trilogy the poor use of visual effects really takes you out of the film     ed skriens performance was the only part of the film i enjoyed although he was let down by the material he was given     it beggars belief that anyone greenlit this woeful production
Jan 3 2024,negative,uninspired tech demo unengagin story  characters maybe im just getting too old for american good vs evil type of movie
Jan 3 2024,positive,fun exciting and compelling characters some say it borrows too much from other films but i wasnt bored or taken out of this movie once you could see how it would have fit into the star wars universe but this is honestly better than anything star wars has put for a while
Jan 3 2024,positive,amazing it makes you think that even when everything is lost you can try again and others will follow you visuals and efects are outstanding
Jan 3 2024,negative,im sorry but this movie is bland unaspiring and cant hold a candle to star wars
Jan 3 2024,negative,cool visuals but what a bad story line poor dialogues bad acting bad stunts full of ineptitude
Jan 3 2024,negative,this movie looks downright silly with all of the unnecessary slow motion overdone character shots and tropey looking aliens and space nazis honestly this seems like a parody rather than a real movie the story is bland the character motives nonexistent and the dialog is pure cringe
Jan 3 2024,negative,overall very disappointing despite being quite interesting in the early scenes as we meet the characters but soon goes downhill comically pantomime nazi villains poorly directed actors emoting all over the place and being allowed to do their best epic performances   being a star wars type space fantasy where a ragtag band of rebels take on the established order against the odds isnt necessarily the problem if this had any charm characters we cared about or the feeling anything really was at stake other than the next slowno action sequence it could have been fine
Jan 3 2024,positive,the movie was excellent amazing visual effects strong ending loved the characters if youre looking for something to watch with a friend or family this is a great choice ignore the critic reviews they are all miserable people
Jan 3 2024,negative,the movie was all over the place with inconsistent storytelling and poor plot development hours were spent introducing new characters for no reason very predictable moments and a poor ending too much emphasis on dramatic moments prior to cutting away to a new scene
Jan 3 2024,negative,imagine the worst star wars rip off you can imagine  you have that in your head now  okay now make it worse
Jan 3 2024,positive,is this a perfect movie no is it confusing at time yes its a new story so of course it is this movie reminded me of playing mass effect this movie has upside and very entertaining is it for everyone probably not im invested and think people should give it a chance
Jan 3 2024,negative,not that great of a movie huge disappointment but this is par for the course now these directors want their movies to look good without actually being good the characterization and storyplot are just bottom tier childs play dont waste your time
Jan 3 2024,negative,honestly this film is major chore to watch it wasnt till the 3rd watch through i was able to pay attention the film really doesnt know what it is starwars wow and narnia combined into an amalgamated mess that hurts the soul to watch   snyder shot for the moon but fell down the stairs with this one
Jan 3 2024,positive,overall an ok movie some of the action scenes could have been better the movie feels a bit rushed i am looking forward to part 2
Jan 3 2024,negative,turned it off after 25 minutes poor acting corny story not for me
Jan 3 2024,negative,it is a very uninteresting story line and the aliens are an insult to all imaginable life forms
Jan 3 2024,negative,if you like characters with a depth of a puddle plenty of bland settings cookie cardboard villains and slow motion of slow motion slowed into oblivion you might get a few good moments out of this otherwise if you are looking for entertainment give yourself a papercut  i can guarantee you will have more fun with it than watching this something
Jan 3 2024,negative,if you are thinking about watching it dont because it is a waste of time everything after the first 30 minutes was super rushed so many new characters are introduced and join the team without any good reasons and the character development is not existent do not recommend
Jan 3 2024,negative,it feels like it was written by a 9 yo i thought it would be nice but the storyline is a mess no affection was made with the characters boring cliche story progression
Jan 3 2024,positive,star wars vibes  great casting and i really liked the whole movie
Jan 3 2024,negative,so blend poor action choregraphy it makes no sense and not explained why a 130 lbs girl beats 8 200 lbs soldiers by herself they have guns she doesnt no plan simply suicidal and brooding the whole movie the movie takes 1 hour to start then the next 30 minutes they have 8 new friends ready to die for a unexplained cause i finished it only hoping it would get better but no   and the racesworld is boring or disgusting   such a waste of money and opportunity to make something good and longlasting
Jan 3 2024,positive,stars wars copycat  it was okay but nothing special  and the villain character doesnt even come close to darth vadar  when you are trying to copy and fail that much it takes away from the story  they tried to top star wars instead of just creating a new story
Jan 3 2024,negative,i was really looking forward to rebel moon whilst it looked pretty the storyline was awful  i managed 30 minutes first time around whilst the lead character was great her companions were just so dull and out of place gave it another go and managed to get to the borg queen fighting the jedi samurai before giving up again it will probably appeal to harry potter fans more than star wars fans
Jan 3 2024,negative,i want to use mib neuralyzer to go back to the way i was before watching this
Jan 3 2024,positive,it 348 am and i stayed up the whole night to watch this i dunno whats wrong with humans or where yall state of mind is but this was amazing i definitely want more great way to start the new year i hope theres more to come just excellent to watch id rate it 10 stars if i could definitely a must watch
Jan 3 2024,neutral,had so much potential
Jan 3 2024,negative,not a complete waste of time but besides the visuals there is nothing to it the story is flat full of cliches i am not sure i will watch part 2
Jan 3 2024,positive,excellent  costumes so many favorites i cant decide the cinematography had epic shots hands down the stunts were well thought i loved how they gave more emphasis to a female lead in part one the special effects was wonderful it gave me star wars or mandalorian vibes
Jan 3 2024,negative,i really enjoyed laughing at the reviews i read while watching this unfortunately terrible film i love scifi and i wanted to love this i do feel bad for the writers visually rad but so so dumb
Jan 3 2024,positive,the film definitely borrows thematically from historical science fiction westerns like star wars and dune but i dont see that as a negative i really enjoyed the film and i especially enjoyed the universe it is creating if you are looking for a science fiction world to be created in film with action and the classic oppressors vs the opressed you will enjoy this i grow tired of lack of character development arguments from film critics regarding every scifi film because they are complaining about something which is of minor relevance to what this film is supposed to be it is not tied to a specific characters development it is creating a universe these same character development critics probably complain that a jeep wrangler isnt refined if you want refined buy a mercedes you buy a jeep for the ruggedness if you want a ton of character development watch a historical fiction drama if you want a new scifi universe watch this film
Jan 3 2024,positive,a bit confusing to start scifi and fantasy movies are generally poorly reviewed but i thought id watch this anyways and i thought it was great less childish than starters i would love to see more character development but overall i found it to be very entertaining excited for the next one
Jan 3 2024,positive,what a visual spectacle a fantastic story and reat action
Jan 3 2024,negative,i still didnt  understand what the movies is trying to showits starwars harrypotter gladiator 300 all mixed up visually we see bits and pieces of every civilization of earththe movie lacks imagination and story
Jan 3 2024,positive,it was better than expected   i really hope they release the extended cut
Jan 3 2024,negative,again a female protagonist front and centervery tired of this trope thats been forced upon us for the pass 15 yearsand in a very poorly written and acted story
Jan 3 2024,positive,if you are up to watch good punching fights and muscles  this is your movie
Jan 3 2024,positive,great movie  everyone i asked loved it an exiting movie till the end of part 1 five 
Jan 3 2024,positive,totally awesome storys a bit dull and the fights scenes need more juicebut the overall visuals are absolutely stunning
Jan 3 2024,negative,a movie written by ai text generator   it is shapeless and senseless without a compelling plot or characters we care for in the slightest
Jan 3 2024,negative,an absolute waste as a huge scifi fan i went into this movie with excitement and hope for something completely new how often do you get to see an entirely new world with this type budget and cast behind it but this movie was so disappointing there was no story nothing new or interesting at all just copy paste from a bunch of other stories there are parts of the movie that are visually very stunning but thats not enough to make up for how bad the writing is
Jan 3 2024,negative,garbage a critic called it derivative and wow were they correct
Jan 3 2024,positive,i enjoyed it  could use less dei posturing as it doesnt need it
Jan 3 2024,negative,great visual effects and poor script all plots are very previsible and the character development is full of holes
Jan 3 2024,negative,its kind of fitting that the best character in this movie is a robot because while rebel moon has interesting visuals it lacks humanity ironically that robot possesses what little humanity exists and once he leaves shortly after the first act gets going its all downhill from there     the bulk of the movie is a planethopping recruitment drive for npcs each has a name a microvignette where they demonstrate the functionality they bring to the party and a brief dialog tree that once clickedthrough alas no skip button is available adds them to the group then they fade into the background never to be heard from or interacted with againexcept to take their turn in each round of combat sometimes accompany their attack action with a random bark of npc dialog     coollooking armor and 5minutes with a charming tin man are not enough reason to sit through this film skip
Jan 3 2024,positive,its an enjoyable movie just for super fans of the genre  the fx are good enough and the fighting scene are fast  unfortunately the plot its way too basic and the characters had literally zero characterisation for a movie wich bet more than half run time in recruiting characters they didnt do a minimum effort in give them a proper introduction its all very rushed like they meet they talk 1 minute to each other and they get convinced to join the cause not plausible at all
Jan 2 2024,negative,absolute dog sht i almost never cant find something to relate to or enjoy this movie was a colossal disaster
Jan 2 2024,negative,nah vfx are goods i felt dizzy on every minutes of slowmotions lol the main character meh    other cast meh story super meh 2hrs or basic story telling
Jan 2 2024,negative,the film solely featuring aesthetically pleasing and hence sometimes uninteresting actors encounters challenges in its direction the execution falls short with issues in blocking and timing affecting the overall cinematic experience the narrative setup lacks the necessary differentiation and depth rendering it somewhat simplistic and naive the portrayal of culture appears to be approached with a somewhat idealized perspective resulting in a cookiecutter representation furthermore the characters unfortunately come across as onedimensional and predictable    one is left pondering the significant craftsmanship and time invested in the creation of the story however the absence of a robust foundation in worldbuilding and emotional relatability diminishes the impact of these efforts a more comprehensive exploration of these aspects could have elevated the overall quality of the film    regrettably due to the aforementioned shortcomings i found it challenging to immerse myself fully in the film ultimately leading to an incomplete viewing experience
Jan 2 2024,positive,it was goodgreat story and good visualsi think it deserves better critics thats why im ranking it 45 
Jan 2 2024,positive,some of the character development is a bitrushed but this feverdream mismash of  scifi is pretty and engrossing  the character development is a bit rushed but the general flow of ideas and worldbuilding is pretty spot on  i would like to see both the directors cut and second part of this series and will recommend it to my friends    upon a bunch of further introspection i think i get why this movie is so divisive  i think perhaps the professional critics and a fair bunch of the nonprofessionals are pretty uninspired by this film because they want to take it as an individual piece of art and a complete work  this is the new normal where a production house can take ten or twenty hours to deliver a story that once had to be encapsulated in 120 minutes or less    this has to be viewed through the lens knowing that this film is only the first part of the narrative and a truncated version at that  when you only get to see the first act you only get exposition and not the character development or building that will happen in the second act and the full heros journey wont complete until the third    i think the reviewers here that think this movie is great are viewing with this episodic lens  i know that watching this i know that there are further episodes coming and i am curious to see how the story develops and what ideas will be presented later on  i am also anxious to see the full release of this episode later as this will also reveal the true vision of this first act hidden here by the pg13 rating requirements  
Jan 2 2024,negative,we are in luck because of the dazzling visuals very nice it is also the only thing that kept me watching since the plot is so focking bad its like a speed run for the most clichés in 1 movie this feels like a collection of every storytelling aspect i hate characters are given personalities that are totally not explored and feel very unnecessary running through the story and leaving immersion and depth at the side the plot could be so much easier but they made it complicated wich is not a problem but please do enlighten us with the complexity of your universe and story it feels like skipping from branch to branch   bad cliché but nice cgi
Jan 2 2024,negative,not sure where to start the story screenplay acting  characters all seem horrendously shallow cheesy and cringe its basically a kids films story with a pg13 theme which underdelivers and therefore isnt one or the other as the depth feels extremely watered down they planet hop to spend 15 minutes on a supposedly secondary character for them to only have 3 more lines for the rest of the film there are times where i dont think the main characters speak for extended periods of time i liked the world building around the current story the flashbacks and the aesthetics but everything else is a huge miss even the action feels janky and stupid with their huge lean on slow motion i have no idea how they were comfortable publishing this the reason id watch the second one is to see how much worse that is
Jan 2 2024,negative,more effort was placed into making this film look pretty than anything else defend your settlement from raiders  fallout 4 go on a quest to gather a host to defend your settlement  dd a bug story throw in a forgettable cast a slice of every scifi ip out there and you have this movie also    i am pretty sure this movie is taking a big ol dump on warhammer 40k in hope of putting a negative light on the franchise belisarius mechanicum reaally i am expecting to see spacemarines the inquisition and titans in the next chapter     my eyes were exhausted and i got vertigo from all the eyerolling and cringe pretty but dumb so pretty dumb
Jan 2 2024,positive,this is a film that serves its purpose nothing more nothing less to say its great or terrible is nonsense this is a flawed but entertaining piece of scifi   the silver motion
Jan 2 2024,neutral,a pale imitation technically nice but philosophically emptyall the historical influences from cinese ming empire to greeks to ussr to nazis to zoulous to american gold rush are melted in that movie
Jan 2 2024,negative,zack sander does it again not in good way
Jan 2 2024,negative,too much pathos zero humour mediocre acting and storyline should have stayed in the farmers village the only likeable characters were there feels like a videogame
Jan 2 2024,negative,what is the point of this film
Jan 2 2024,negative,havent  seen the movie but i know it sucks cause synder sucks
Jan 2 2024,positive,the films visuals are good but the amount of elements based on trendy films from recent decades was exaggerated the story was shallow no different from the fashionable space adventure films of the last five years but the twist at the end and the outcome i found interesting it motivated me to see what comes next
Jan 2 2024,negative,slightly interesting in the beginning but from then on the story and the acting just goes downhill way too much color and as in most of snyders films too much color and effects that just feel like an attempt to cover up poor storytelling and shallow characters
Jan 2 2024,neutral,cinematography and action scenes were good no story line to tie or show character motivations just paint by numbers when assembling the heroes a lot of potential with the story but didnt feel fully fleshed out hope part 2 will improve
Jan 2 2024,positive,weak plot like seriously  however great visuals and music decent movie overall but nothing special its not one of them movies that you would like to rewatch
Jan 2 2024,negative,knew it was going to be bad 5 minutes in but watched anyway please may i have the two hours of my life bad one of the worst movies i have ever seen only good scene was a combat robot shooting a bad guy in the head without aiming truly horrendous in all respects
Jan 2 2024,negative,it seems like it was written by a 11 year old who saw star wars and heard about seven samurai both long and rushed somehow there is no difference in the walrus assembled other than how they look  also the empire can fire from low orbit so what are warriors with swords and guns going to do a single peak mountain with water falls  wheres the water coming from bland and every style of clothes is found on earth
Jan 2 2024,positive,i have been very disappointed with movies for the past few years rebel moon brought something fresh and interesting i enjoyed the story the action and the acting i wish they would have just released the directors cut first i cannot wait for part 2
Jan 2 2024,positive,its a good movie  yes it has a somewhat star wars vibe and maybe other fantasy movies  give it a try with an ope mind instead of expecting to hate it   most movies being put out these days arent good  this one was  some people are just bitter and cant enjoy a movie  these people giving it one star will still most likely be watching part 2   they have to know what happens     im not getting the comparison with the robots to star wars  transformers maybe in the what was it  5th one  star wars no  theyre also not really in the movie much
Jan 2 2024,positive,once you accept there are no truly original ideas and that every story draws upon the many that came before you can set aside your high horse and ask yourself was i not entertained this universe was visually captivating and the story was exciting the characters had as much depth as possible in less than 2 hrs not a whole lot but still had me rooting for against them a child of fire has me excited for part 2 and is worth watching for any fan of scifi and actionadventure
Jan 2 2024,negative,i am not sure i have the vocabulary to describe how bad this film is     the script is more banal than a three year olds storybook the plot is a hackneyed take on stars wars mixed with the magnificent seven and the characterisation is nonexistent leaving the viewer not caring at all who lives and who does not    add to that the feeling that the universe has now become the wokeverse and it is a movie to avoid at all costs
Jan 2 2024,negative,a bunch of stuff happens to people no one cares about     rebel moon is one of those movies that focuses more on visual appeal than telling a story people care about its far too plot driven while the characters sit in the sidecar its not worth watching beyond the first act which was just ok
Jan 2 2024,negative,disappointing for an original it seemed anything but imagine a mix of dune star wars and the kriptonian design of ships  a costumes from man of steel with a healthy dose of the pandering that was referenced in south parks panerverse episode  super cheesy tropes and thats my best summation of this one wildly disappointing  dont think ill invest another 2 hours to see part 2
Jan 2 2024,positive,while character development might be lacking in the second act rebel moon  part one a child of fire is a visually stunning and actionpacked film with good worldbuilding i look forward to seeing what happens next
Jan 2 2024,positive,the film is solid the visuals are great the critics are either stupid or full of hate maybe both 
Jan 2 2024,negative,its just a boring combination of other movies but at least some nice visual effects  still it generates zero excitement i will skip part 2
Jan 2 2024,negative,one dimensional characters with absolutely not a thing as depth or credibility  mostly awful universe  empire acting like bullies on a small random village for no reason villain acting like a spoiled child and this is hard to see trained soldiers acting like a school drama   people joining the crew with no reason whatsoever even the action parts are mediocre at best bits of story everywhere that could have been fleshed out but were not  i find it disturbing to know that a lot of people have been paid for making this thing
Jan 2 2024,negative,truly terrible each character introduced gets about 2 minutes of screen time before joining the rebellion and thats about all the character building you can expect from this movie    the romance if it can be called that is shown by a few impassive glances    the action scenes are unfortunately no better pointless lasers flying around while main characters stand in the open waving around sticks and swords    the only positive is in its unrealised potential as a world it shows a few glimpses of an expensive and interesting universe that could have been but never will
Jan 2 2024,positive,thin characters yes but still an enjoyable ride
Jan 2 2024,negative,it had great visuals but i was very bored it was basically a bunch of short stories and overly done slow motion scenes
Jan 2 2024,negative,i saw direct rip offs of star wars serenity starship troopers and lara croft all in the first 15 minutes not a single original idea in it all with snyders usual visual tropes wont be watching any directors cut and certainly no sequel
Jan 2 2024,positive,great watch dark and very entertaining miles ahead of recent marvel  superhero garbage coming out lately looking forward to part 2
Jan 2 2024,positive,good action film  not much plot but good characters
Jan 2 2024,positive,yes it borrows some elements from other movies but i dont think it is as horrible as others say its hard to maka a classic fight an evil empire story without doing something thats already been done  my biggest grief is that the soldiers left to guard was over the top evil to obvious apart from the above a solid movie with stunning visuals enjoy
Jan 2 2024,negative,bad story telling super bad effects
Jan 2 2024,negative,worst than i thought it would be  it felt like a too serious version of star wars without any memorable characters or a resemblance of a coherent storyline  boring and not what i expected  pass on this one
Jan 2 2024,negative,the story was formulaic and predictable the villains were space nazis certain plot points made no sense overall there was too much cringe
Jan 2 2024,negative,corny and disjointed it lacks the ability to anchor the viewer within the story there are some visually pleasing scenes but they do not make up for the rest of the heap
Jan 2 2024,negative,the worst movie ive seen in recent memory i heard it was a rejected star wars movie pitch and it shows the worldbuilding is lazy and uninspired mostly delivered through excessive and tedious exposition and monologues the story is yet another shameless ripoff of seven samurai with a random collection of scifi tropes thrown in for good measure twodimensional characters and wooden acting are the final nail in the coffin i stopped and started the movie about four times trying to give it a chance and hoping it would get good i turned it off with about 20 minutes left because i couldnt bear it anymore
Jan 2 2024,positive,its nice to have a regular schmegular heros journey movie thats scifi they havent made anything epic since the early 2000s ignore critics if youre a regular person they like atonement enough said
Jan 2 2024,positive,good movie funny and great fx
Jan 2 2024,positive,you have to be in the right mindset for this movie if you think you wont like it chances are you wont but if you keep an open mind youll see the movie for what it really is i thought it was pretty good and im looking forward to the other movies
Jan 2 2024,positive,from reading the reviews i guess boomers dont want their memories of star wars be besmirched  it was great  casting acting the sets story was a great heros journey the best space movie since the original guardians of the galaxy
Jan 2 2024,positive,this is a goodlooking scifi movie of the typical heros journey story genre are there parallels to star wars yes because that is another heros journey story written as a scifi space rebellion arc i liked the characters and villians in this story the acting was well done the story is interesting and written well i await the sequels to see how it all endsor continues
Jan 2 2024,positive,whilst a slow burn i found myself on the edge of my seat the world building  introduction of characters has created space for what is sure to be an epic saga whilst the storyline is something that has been told before that is the case with most scifi  fantasy novels its a heros quest for redemption  for what is good in the world the visuals were epic  the characters have depth that i look forward to diving into as they the journey continues  cant wait for part two
Jan 2 2024,positive,ignore the critics this is a brilliant first part to a new space adventure looking forward to part 2
Jan 2 2024,negative,it was nice to see a new sci fi film and i was really ready to enjoy it but it was so completely unimaginative there was so much room to develop characters more but they didnt the story was boring so everything felt predictable it took too much from other stories and just seemed lazy and cliche my partner loved it though because he doesnt overanalyze
Jan 2 2024,negative,it keeps a fast pace of an action movie but the story is uninteresting and the characters shallow  the villain goes around with a a large bone in hand while commanding a ship that is worldender the physics and the anachronism of the movie are so bad that would wake you up in case you fell asleep between some slowmotion combats scenes
Jan 2 2024,positive,i think this movie is severely underrated i love a good futuristic sciif and this movie checks all the boxes the special effects dont look cheap like most movies with that much background animation the action scenes are very well done and super entertaining to watch the fantasy aspect is captivating and visually appealing
Jan 2 2024,positive,rebel moonpart 1 a child of fire meh i watched it alot of obvious see me camera angles music ok not great the usual underdog  treachery backstabbing underhandedness supposed to be 1 in filums underwhelming  650
Jan 2 2024,negative,absolutely awful a bunch of random scifi and fantasy tropes smooshed together with some decent special effects story was ridiculous fight scenes make less than 0 sense i would trust an 8th grader to come up with a better movie plot
Jan 2 2024,positive,amazing movie disney screwed up letting this one slip by
Jan 2 2024,positive,interesting movie and characters
Jan 2 2024,negative,backstory the movie
Jan 2 2024,positive,good scifi and have potential story
Jan 1 2024,neutral,this film felt extremely generic as a big scifi fan i wanted to like it but it just came down to the same old tropes with un interesting characters
Jan 1 2024,positive,this movie is pretty good  im not sure what people want there hasnt been a war based sci fi film that isnt a remake that got good reviews in forever  be thankful that this one is pretty good
Jan 1 2024,positive,loved it something different for a change
Jan 1 2024,neutral,basically a remake of battle beyond the stars some good visuals baffling accent choices yes of course the villain went to eton clearly laying some storylines for future parts but ultimately nothing to justify the money spent  no better than many straight to tvstreaming films that cost a fraction of this budget  glad i didnt pay to see at the cinema but entertaining enough to watch through
Jan 1 2024,negative,its classic space opera the problem being that if already with the pilot  it accumulates lots of negatives  far too many unnecessary lengths  narrative exposition which weighs down the already not good pace as much as the 1st fight in the camp is nice  punchy the 2nd in the inn with the badguy wanting to fck one of the characters but its sooo slow a sensation that will come back ofteen 
Jan 1 2024,negative,watched because of the great actors movie really sucked storyline was very weak just like the movie in general
Jan 1 2024,positive,loved the imagery story and characters while familiar it was still unique in its undertone focused on empathy and kindness as n such a harsh world beautifully filmed and fight scenes choreographed
Jan 1 2024,negative,justice league vs the space nazis  poorly shot weirdly lit medley of every scifi trope available set against a backdrop of cheap cg and peppered with wooden acting
Jan 1 2024,positive,excellent movie fresh different yet everything you want in a sci fi movie
Jan 1 2024,negative,i watched the entire movie
Jan 1 2024,positive,forget about critics reviews the movie is great
Jan 1 2024,positive,love the start of a new story the visuals of each planet has its own beauty there are also shots in a scene that make you wonder if a hidden image or meaning exists in that shot there are characters in this film that one can identify with some of these characters you just love to hate and theres still more back story and future story to tell with these characters i understand that part one has set up the team i am so ready for part 2
Jan 1 2024,positive,universe is cool would have liked to see more than just a pit stop at planets
Jan 1 2024,positive,thoroughly enjoyed it many artful scenes
Jan 1 2024,negative,i cant really describe how boring this movie felt everything seemed so generic i felt no involved at all with the charatcers that felt incredibly dumb at times i mean is it so hard to write something a little interesting slow motions and lens flares are not enough to make it a decent movie i usually tend to finish watching even things i dont like but im not going to watch part two
Jan 1 2024,negative,i dont even know where to start with this one the pacing was horrible they had a crazy overreliance on slow motion they introduced a bunch of super interesting characters with little to no backstory or development and the main character is and i cannot stress this enough literally gamora but instead of being adopted by thanos she was adopted by the empire from star wars this movie was horrible
Jan 1 2024,positive,i liked rebel moon it was not perfect but it was a fun watch
Jan 1 2024,positive,very entertaining  a fun ride from start to finish
Jan 1 2024,positive,what is wrong with you guys i cant even remember in the last 15 years when someone delivered an scifi like rebel moon this movie should be above 70
Jan 1 2024,negative,how did they ever get funding for this an unending row of cliches unbearably bad
Jan 1 2024,negative,give me back two and a half hours of my life my god what ever expectetion you have for this movie make it lower
Jan 1 2024,negative,not enough time given to develop each of the characters and sooo full of fantasy stereotypes this is a story that would probably be better as a 3book trilogy and then another trope can be checked visually pretty
Jan 1 2024,negative,for once the pro critics are right
Jan 1 2024,positive,300 meets star wars love them both and love rebel moon
Jan 1 2024,negative,the lack of creativity is strong here the cynical way of trying to get away with copying various science fiction masterpieces verbatim so much visual garbage unnecessary vfx abuse and painful slow motion  and snyders said his cut is the best save time and avoid this mistake
Jan 1 2024,negative,dull wooden script and acting and so much slomo you have time to take a nap during action scenes
Jan 1 2024,positive,well done but nothing new its pretty formulaicalthough im looking forward to the sequel
Jan 1 2024,negative,zack should let actual writers do the writing and not force them to insert his ideas into the narrative ever  rebel moon is nothing but a collection of scififantasy tropes cliches dressed up with tired and overused designs swipes from video games comics and other better movies and tv shows  rebel moon is absolute garbage  yuk
Jan 1 2024,positive,i am not a big scifi person but i actually enjoyed this and looking forward to next part of the series
Jan 1 2024,positive,for first time it is huge thumbs up nice visual effects i will watch again in few months definitely waiting for the sequel coming in april 2024
Jan 1 2024,negative,maybe its so bad its good the dialogue is cheesy and thereby hilarious and overall its stupid i watched the whole thing
Jan 1 2024,neutral,it was visually very nice but felt like a mash up of star wars guardians of the galaxy and dune the winged creature was stright up from hogwarts but in night mode if some one hasnt seen any of the movies they would find it cool story line is pretty formulaic so much so that you can predict whats gonna happen in the next movies
Jan 1 2024,positive,i delayed watching this after reading the critics review so was surprised by how much i enjoyed rebel moon  yes its derivative but so is almost every modern sci fi film ive ever watched with the possible exception of blade runner and inception  the backstory narratives were important to set the scene for the series the acting was good and pleasantly lowkey the dialogue was nicely minimalist the cinematography was wonderful and the action was gripping    and the magnificent seven was an excellent remake so using seven samurai as inspiration is a bonus  we need to stop with the whining star wars fanboy reviews or well never see part 2
Jan 1 2024,positive,its like watching a bad superhero moviemeh
Jan 1 2024,negative,this was nothing more than a rip off of the very first star wars movie rebels weird music and characters in a bar finding rouge pilot to fly you to look for more future  rebels fight off empire fleet while vastly out numbered acting thats not even that good and to make it even worse enough cgi to choke a horse if you want to see this kind of movie watch star wars 100 times better
Jan 1 2024,positive,it looks great and if youre inclined you can spend your time guessing which movie a scene has come from or see how many of the actors appeared in game of thrones but to be honest it is over two hours long and thats only part one i dont think were gonna make it
Jan 1 2024,positive,great story a lot of fun to watch
Jan 1 2024,positive,awesome movie definitely cant wait for part two
Jan 1 2024,negative,im glad i didnt pay money to see this in a theater even starting out with no expectations it was still a disappointment
Jan 1 2024,negative,what did i just saw    such bad and lazy script writing
Jan 1 2024,positive,im not sure why so low rating here but i enjoyed a lot such a mix of dune starwars and everything i liked aesthetics
Jan 1 2024,positive,300 meets star wars the storyline is flat and the effects are really good an enjoyable watch but nothing that will surprise you or make you think
Jan 1 2024,positive,i was entertained yes its derivative not nearly so much as john wick 4 but i liked all the movies it stole from so yes i was entertained and look forward to the second half
Jan 1 2024,positive,very good start to the saga waiting for the sequel which seems promising
Jan 1 2024,negative,if you like watching other people play video games then you might enjoy this there is no acting required for this film the dialogue is either voice over exposition or grunts and orders during fight scenes this is an idea for a movie but not a realized vision
Jan 1 2024,positive,the movie was not a masterpiece but entertaining and hopefully it will get better with part 2 the universe has potential i like   the movie
Jan 1 2024,negative,poor battle beyond the stars rip off with a modern diverse cast
Jan 1 2024,positive,if youve seen enough of zack snyders movies this is typically how they are as long as you go into knowing his style youll really enjoy the movie ignore the critics the movie is a great watch
Jan 1 2024,positive,first 5 minutes was a little worried but quickly found myself drawn in fun universe he created very star wars meets cyberpunk im excited to see the next part in april
Jan 1 2024,positive,visually stunning it is a good idea but the choppy story weakens the film and the at times patronizing dialog suffers youll get mad at the films potential to be great but in the end youll have enjoyed watching it
Jan 1 2024,negative,awful character developmentwriting worst movie ive seen in a while
Jan 1 2024,neutral,boring storyline a duplicate of familiar stories
Jan 1 2024,negative,there are movies made as if the setting and the heroes inspire and invigorate the authors this movie is opposite i got a feeling personally that the authors were as much bored and disgusted with it as was i
Jan 1 2024,negative,superb special effects cannot help a story built on tropes of the star wars series rebellion by downtrodden characters against an evil intergalactic empire a lovable robot a weird assemblage of aliens in a space bar etc there are certainly moments of a little tension but the outcome is never in doubt add to this that the inconsistencies are alarming  a society where people plough with horses hunt elk and cook over fires yet have automatic sliding doors and electric lights spend your time on something better
Jan 1 2024,negative,tries hard with plots and lines from  other various scifi movies but fails some good effects but not that engaging
Jan 1 2024,negative,its pretty its familiar its mildly entertaining and will fill in two hours dont come here looking for anything original though     take the best most cliched parts of all the scifi and classic western movies ever made and put them together into one scifi movie be sure to go extra heavy on the star wars franchise take inspiration and the best bits from everything from slang and clothing from gangster movies mafia movies action movies and even a smidgen of harry potter beasts and voila youve got it its rebel moon     entertaining pretty but not an original bone in its body
Jan 1 2024,negative,i want to like sofia boutella in something but even slowermo isnt going to do it
Jan 1 2024,negative,unnessesery long jumping to fast between sets bad characters over using of slow motion and the visuals are somethimes blurred and not sharp for any reason
Jan 1 2024,negative,awful accent  unwatchable please redub
Jan 1 2024,positive,i dont get all these bad ratings if you dont like sci fi movies dont watch them just to give them a bad rating this was a really entertaining movie really well done 
Jan 1 2024,negative,sw is bad enough these days do we really need more hacks attempting to duplicate their mindless drivel bad scifi bad writing bad acting no originality
Jan 1 2024,negative,this movie gave me diarrhea
Jan 1 2024,positive,i cannot understand any of the hate towards this movie quality acting quality graphics quality production predictable  sure  but in no way hurts the amazingness and enjoyment of the experience watch it and enjoy and stop being such critics
Jan 1 2024,positive,not as bad as critics make it out to be i actually watched the whole thing
Jan 1 2024,negative,writing was god awful not sure how much that affected the really bad acting but it certainly didnt help
Jan 1 2024,positive,the visual effects were superb throughout with compelling characters and outstanding performances especially cara the plot and setting reminds you of several universes but it never detracted from the viewing experience i thought one scene at the trading city bar was reminiscent of the star wars cantina but that was the only blatant borrowing i saw obviously it is about a group of rebels that rebel against an empire so you can see some of the parallels to star wars i also felt it had some homage to dune and chronicles of riddick the movie plays quickly at 215 i never felt it dragged and let me just say there is a twist near the end that surprised me and something unexpected i understand this is a multipart series so hopefully it will develop a following if you love scifi give it a chance and enjoy it for what it is and do not try to overanalyze it
Jan 1 2024,positive,i would give it a 4 out of 5 for what its worth it was obviously a star wars rip off but it was a rip off i enjoyed while i hated the character development pacing and length it was a movie i enjoyed and excited to see the future one of the reasons why i am writing a positive review is because it is only the start of something and has great potential
Jan 1 2024,positive,the writingdialogue felt very juvenile and the multiple grandstanding slow motion sequences felt cringe and pointless    i wasnt impressed
Jan 1 2024,negative,the plot is bugs life in space they did get warriors instead of circus performers
Jan 1 2024,positive, rebelmoon pg13 cómo película cumple todas las expectativas es entretenida tiene muy buena acción buen vfx hermosa cinematografía y un excelente score una problemática bastante relacionable y con una historia facil de seguir   esta versión abarca lo suficiente en cuanto historia y desarrollo para introducirnos a este universo y a estos personajes y justamente al mostrar solo lo suficiente para comprender la trama y personajes te hace querer conocer y ver mas dándole a la audiencia el ideal de seguir enganchado y querer ver la parte dos de esta historia y el futuro corte del director para indagar en el pasado de los rebeldes y en el trasfondo de la historia aún mejor rebel moon va directo al punto una dinámica que se puede percibir tal vez apresurada pero para lo que intenta ser esta versión lo logra muy bien una introducción épica pero sencilla al público a un nuevo universo     rebelmoon as a pg13 movie meets all expectations it is entertaining it has very good action good vfx beautiful cinematography and an excellent score a very relatable issue with an easy to follow story  this version covers enough history and development to introduce us to this universe and these characters and precisely by showing just enough to understand the plot and characters it makes you want to know and see more giving the audience the ideal of staying hooked and wanting to see part two of this story and the future directors cut to delve into the rebels past and the background of the story even better rebel moon gets straight to the point a dynamic that can perhaps be perceived as rushed but for what this version tries to be it achieves it very well an epic but simple introduction for the audience to a new universe
Jan 1 2024,negative,poor character development and boring
Jan 1 2024,negative,quite possibly the worst movie ive ever seen  its not original at all its directly a 1 for 1 rip of battle beyond the stars for the first half  nothing in this movie is actually original  its as if the writer took his favorite clips of movies hes watched and fed them into an ai script generator and filmed what came out the other side   also 75 of the film is purposely blurry for artistic reasons but only served to annoy me
Jan 1 2024,negative,not only did it steal ideas and styles from the likes of star wars star trek and lord of the rings but it looks like they also stole their makeup and props  add that to the two characters with absolute awful impersonations of northern ireland accents for whatever that was meant to add to the story  it was a god awful movie  please writers and actors go back on strike looking back that was a much happier time for the viewer
Jan 1 2024,negative,watch the seven samourai 1954 or the magnificient seven  1960 and you will get a better movie actors and better script
Jan 1 2024,negative,this movie is like a very bad composition of star wars star trek ghost in the shell warhammer 40k and even some mythology element wtf there is literally no build up of the charaters and no climax i felt like i was watching a very low budget scifi movie both the storyline and the directing are exeuted extremely poor this is definitely one of the worst movies i have watched in 2023 if not the worst
Jan 1 2024,positive,this movie was so good unbelievable graphics were great a nice mix of medieval times and new technology the story was beautiful and the fights were incredibly good cant wait for part 2 of the movie
Dec 31 2023,positive,loved it cant wait for the full length r rated version to see more
Dec 31 2023,negative,terrible save yourself the embarrassment of having a part 2
Dec 31 2023,negative,it just wasnt my cup of tea
Dec 31 2023,positive,it definitely gives off star wars vibes however the storyplot is what id call decent it at least keeps you watching i am disappointed its in parts as id prefer more finalization the ending is a bit unrealistic and frustrating the cgi is a little meh during some scenes but overall visually appealing some parts are predictable almost painfully so  but doesnt hurt the overall movie the acting could use a little polishing as some seriousdramatic scenes were almost comical and im sure that was not intended i do plan on watching further parts for finalization to the story as it does have my attention as id like to see where this story goes
Dec 31 2023,negative,visually great once the storyline evolves its all downhill from there i really feel that this was one of the 1st movie scripts written fully by ai the writers fed it 5 other successful scifi movies and said turn all of these into 1 movie giving us rebel moon
Dec 31 2023,positive,i liked it i knew it would get bad reviews before it came out it held my attention and was a lot of fun and i cant wait for part two so there
Dec 31 2023,neutral,seem like copy paste from random movies magic sifi mixed with olden times wtf its like chatgpt created it
Dec 31 2023,negative,nonsensical tripe zero sense of scale or appropriateness eg rustic cottages with sliding doors but lets use a horse drawn plough  for agriculture
Dec 31 2023,positive,this movie is great a great start to a new universe i cant wait to see more amazing visuals and great action
Dec 31 2023,positive,agree with other reviews  still enjoyed the movie and will watch second one but fails to establish an enduring ip  liberally takes from other scifi ips starwars  foundation even potter to name a few  and does not invest enough in character development  general titus tarlak  nemesis and others all deserved more time in their background to make us care and get vested      will be mostly enjoyed and forgotten fast
Dec 31 2023,positive,derivative in details but solid story core even if based off of seven samurai i think this would have been better as a series more time for character development would have benefited the story very entertaining just dont go into this movie thinking star wars be open minded
Dec 31 2023,positive,i thought this movie was epic the first fight scene where shes protecting the girl literally got my heart pounding i dont understand why so many disliked this movie because i thought it was amazing and i cant wait for part 2
Dec 31 2023,positive,the film major inspirations include star wars and game of thrones there are interesting characters and the visuals are excellent however the film is too predictable and could have a much stronger plot to be better i did enjoy watching it but it could have been better overall i recommend it especially for fans of the scifi genre
Dec 31 2023,positive,it was fine and that is all the cgi was decent the acting was pretty good but the story was seriously lacking i feel like a whole lot of nothing happened i have a feeling when part 2 comes out well be saying they could have cut both films down to make one movie
Dec 31 2023,negative,nice visuals terrible script terrible acting improbable scenarios  i dont mean the scifi elements of course more the human interactions which are weak and too easy too obvious its the magnificent seven of the 21st century done very badly i wont be watching part ii if it were to be released
Dec 31 2023,positive,movie has flaws but very enjoyable it doesnt deserve all the negative reviews
Dec 31 2023,negative,the character development plot melodrama all horrible its like if you asked ai to make a movie mashing up star wars harry potter the matrix lord of the rings and vikings theres no reason to care about the characters or their struggles just instantly drama theres no humor most of the characters arent even likeable the action and the plot are very contrived you can tell whats going to happen before it does just more terrible scifi garbage  we want good scifi movies again this aint it
Dec 31 2023,negative,so stereotyped and hackneyed it looks like a parody until it becomes so violent it becomes torture porn truly an unpleasant experience  i cannot imagine how depraved the directors cut must be if this is the cleaned up version
Dec 31 2023,negative,a thick base of star wars seasoned with a dose of lotr plus some elements of dune with a pinch of gladiator and a little harry potter plus anything you want to add thats the recipe
Dec 31 2023,positive,very predictable at times but enjoyable like game of thrones meets star wars excited for part 2
Dec 31 2023,negative,overall not great not likeable characters overall poorly casted way too much slow motion scenes which is a zach trademark 
Dec 31 2023,positive,dont believe the hate hype  the movie has a unique fascinating aesthetic an action oriented plot and an intriguing premise  comments that criticize a disjointed and incoherent plot are completely misplaced  the story is more than easy to follow and the character flashbacks are well introduced can not wait for part 2
Dec 31 2023,negative,its star wars meets game of thrones meets harry potter meets the avengers   are there no new tales to tell bowing to a hippogriff to tame it really the graphics were nice but seriously the story line was predictable by almost everyone over the age of ten years
Dec 31 2023,negative,felt like someone told chat gbt to make a western scifi movie with nazis and slow motion wast of time watching it ive seen better stories in mystery science theater 3000
Dec 31 2023,positive,this is one of those movies that hits all the right cliches to make it a good waste of an hour and a half if youre up for it
Dec 31 2023,negative,nothing original plain predictilable storyline everthing look like everything done before
Dec 31 2023,positive,i really liked rebel moon despite the critics reviews it had great effects and cgi a storyline to get behind and interesting characters enjoy it for what it is  an action packed visually dynamic film all in all very entertaining and looking forward to the next chapter
Dec 31 2023,positive,it was going for complex and ended up being too simple of a story visuals were perfect its like a space 300
Dec 31 2023,positive,it was not what i expect from this film but it was cool
Dec 31 2023,positive,it has been a long time since i watched an epic scifi that doesnt have any kind of source material rebel moon part 1 has amazing casts and premises cgi is also very satisfying sound design and scores are great to hear the only thing that i think rebel moon can improve is the action scenes since ive been exposed to john wick most action scenes in movies just feels off will watch part 2 and if there is a directors cut absolutely will watch also
Dec 31 2023,negative,great visuals but thats it the story is a mixture of a dozen other movies character development is not existing if you are home alone the weather outside is awful and you did like star warscomicsdune go for it
Dec 31 2023,negative,has the feeling of being written by someone who watched star wars once and stepped in to become a writer during the strike
Dec 31 2023,negative,so many tropes theres no room for characters to breathe its so inspired by others that it could be a sequelprequel to any movie big waste of everything for everyone
Dec 31 2023,negative,over the top bad guys turned me off too much and stopped watching after about 30 mins
Dec 31 2023,positive,isit an oscar worthy film worthy of 5 stars no     but it is entertaining visually amazing and its a completely new universe no source material     yes it borrows elements from other movies but what movie doesnt these days     at worst this film should be 5 stars imo     average at the very least     will watch the directors cut and part 2 for sure
Dec 31 2023,positive,i love it an entertaining movie with incredible photography and that is not more than what it promises but not less either
Dec 31 2023,positive,superb  slow paced at times but that gives you time to appreciate the stunning visuals  battle sequences are remarkable  music score is perfect looking forward to seeing part 2 
Dec 31 2023,negative,basically a starwarslike version of seven samurai 1954  kurosawa akira   only with far more poor story   and poor trying hard to be cool action scenes    dont waste your time on this one go see seven samurai instead
Dec 31 2023,positive,this movie is a masterpiece
Dec 31 2023,negative,bland derivative boring honestly just painful to watch especially when it had a lot of potential visuals were honestly pretty good but the plot the writing the dialogue the characters just made me want to put a gun to my head or atleast switch to a better movie like dune star wars ect because at least its then the source material and not just a lazy poorly executed knockoff
Dec 31 2023,positive,of course when you watch the first part of a new movie with no advertising or book hype its hard to understand the plot like maze runner but this movie is awesome graphics and plot are awesome i love it cant wait for part ii
Dec 31 2023,positive,reminds me a lot of firefly  the origin story made it is a little disconnected but it has a lot of potential
Dec 31 2023,positive,it seems to be a mix of many scifi movies it has you rooting for the protagonist  decent story  good effects entertaining
Dec 31 2023,negative,wanted it to be akin to star wars but wasnt the case just another 500 knockoff with badannoying cinematography and a loose plot turned it off after 10mins wish i wouldve sooner
Dec 31 2023,positive,great movie i was entertained i loved the characters and the storyline was interesting
Dec 31 2023,positive,if you like the magnificent seven or you are a big fan of scifi and fantasy this movie will feel like your happy place sure it pulls from a lot of previous work but it is pure fun and visually awesome dont let the curmudgeon skeptics dissuade you watch it
Dec 31 2023,negative,no creativity no story coherence just a bunch of clips from star wars matrix the 5th element gladiator brave heart etc and whats up with the overuse of slow motion along with dramatic music every  5 minutes it became tedious to watch so i ended up muting the movie and scrolling my phone
Dec 31 2023,positive,great action slo mo wasnt bad stop nit picking good story was like dune but the idea was pitched to star wars before the most recent movie of dune came out great characters excited for part 2
Dec 31 2023,positive,great move loved the story and the vfx
Dec 31 2023,negative,this was a very big disapointment wow  the only thing i will give credit to this movie was anthony hopkins voice being used and some of the visuals were quite good  this was awful
Dec 31 2023,positive,exceptional cast build up and story line
Dec 31 2023,positive,entertained me so its fine
Dec 31 2023,positive,the movie is funny and have scenes joinfuly it doesnt change your life but its easy to see until ends
Dec 31 2023,negative,i was so excited about this movie but it was so stupid and boring a few fight scenes were amazing the lead actress is amazing but the rest of this film is trying too hard to be an alternative scifistar wars esque type film there was just too much from 300 as far as style and film tricks and the rest was just plain stupid im so sorry to say all of this just over it already ugh
Dec 31 2023,negative,its not the worst movie ive ever seen character development sucks characters in general suck but its semi entertaining
Dec 31 2023,positive,not bad but not great either kinda like a star wars sequel with less familiar characters and elements of dune and foundation
Dec 31 2023,positive,really liked the movie so many movies the critics get wrong like this one
Dec 31 2023,positive,to say it is a masterpiece is an understatement the only thing that can be criticized is the length since it could easily last at least an hour more to better develop the plot but despite of that the movie delivers cant wait to see the part two
Dec 31 2023,negative,very boring far too long and the usage of slow mo was so completely pointless it was like someone just hit the slowmo button at random times and far too often as if my 4 year old was manning the button the characters and acting were boring weak and just plain bad the plot was so simple and the costumes also made absolutely no sense nothing about the movie was coherent
Dec 31 2023,positive,only gets 3 stars for me due to production and visuals     movies started with potential for me but plot couldnt carry it through to the end
Dec 31 2023,positive,very entertaining movie cant wait for part two
Dec 31 2023,negative,if this wasnt written by ai im not convinced it wasnt we can use it as a reminder of how derivative things already became before ai took over
Dec 31 2023,positive,actually like this im just annoyed that we have to wait for part two
Dec 31 2023,positive,yes it pulls from an array of scifi and fantasy themes however its very well paced and quite entertaining if you are a fan of star wars and lord of the rings you will definitely enjoy this movie 
Dec 31 2023,negative,isnt this just battle beyond the stars  seemed very derivative
Dec 31 2023,negative,prob the worst movie ive seen this year
Dec 31 2023,negative,one of the most uncreative movies ive seen the visuals are amazing but the story is basic this feels like a bad mix up of dune and star wars im kinda done with space nazis too
Dec 31 2023,negative,the film is interesting but the script is weak and meaningless
Dec 31 2023,positive,very entertaining people are jumping on the bandwagon of recent film flops this one is not one of those it is a very stylistic  visually compelling film while it plays on tropes much like any genre it sets up for a story and sci fi world that has been missing in recent film ignore the bad reviews sick film
Dec 31 2023,negative,substance lacking derivative scifi that invokes no feelings in the viewer towards the characters or plot unfortunately isnt made up for in action with slow style fight scenes making it an unengaging and dull watch
Dec 31 2023,negative,really bad not just bad but really bad weak storyline bad acting accents that keep changing irish one moment northern irish the next plot non existent no idea why there was so many slowmos it was like i was back in the 1980s or maybe it was an attempt to divert attention from just how shite this really was
Dec 31 2023,negative,writing was pretty poor the acting was not very good lots of inconsistencies and jumps if this is supposed to be a brand new movie and not just the star wars rip off than it needs to fill in the gaps and explain the motivation of the characters a lot of the characters just were given one or two sentences and suddenly just jumped in and started helping the protagonist a lot of the acting was just grossing chewing and just not a very entertaining movie
Dec 30 2023,negative,absolutely not a single original line trope nor character takes itself way too seriously without delivering any kind of actual plot storyline or arc that anyone over the age of 11 would care can be visually stimulating at times but pushes epicness so much that it becomes annoying theres only so much slowmotion smoke lens flares and epic chorus you can take in a movie
Dec 30 2023,negative,naaah you would think that with all the present technology and ai it should be amazing but its just ridiculous to watch
Dec 30 2023,positive,rebel moon an space opera that is mostly based on previous scifi movies but  photography is excellent scenarios are net and believable the characters still are not developed only introduced the rhythm is fast and enjoyable but probably is missing at least one hour of deeper content sure will be delivered on part two its only the part one of two careful with that the characters and encounters are fun    so for now we can see only half of whats to come for me was fun entertaining and solid basement for the climax on part ii     the references for this film are star wars warhammer 40k and 7 samurai
Dec 30 2023,positive,visually stunning  good special effects and cast a lot more gritty and bloody than star wars i enjoyed it and recommend it to all
Dec 30 2023,negative,it started out well enough but fell apart as it went very jumbled middle act and poorly done final act not great but somewhat entertaining in parts
Dec 30 2023,positive,great movie haters gonna hate
Dec 30 2023,negative,a truly awful waste of a scifi film it is so rare to have an original big budget scifi in a scene dominated by star wars superheroes and adaptations unfortunately this is anything but original its a new hope meets seven samurai whilst trying to be dune but it fails on all fronts every single line of dialogue is exposition or a cliche inspirational diatribe just a really dumb and boring film
Dec 30 2023,negative,same old story been done over and over to the point youd think they would know how to make interesting characters and there are writers and directors out there that can make a good story and interesting characters they just werent involved in this movie one word to describe   lame
Dec 30 2023,positive,this was something different i gave it a chance and i loved it way to go zack  brilliantly casted  story line was a bit rushed but i know the real cut would have filled missing pieces great movie
Dec 30 2023,positive,this is great plenty of drama tension and action in a well realised universe
Dec 30 2023,positive,great movie must watch
Dec 30 2023,positive,this film proves that critics dont matter period
Dec 30 2023,negative,the movie is basically a mesh of marvel movie stereotypes mixed with references to other franchises mainly wh40k in a bad way and star wars  was expecting something less sexualised i dont mind some sexual undertones but here they where just awkward  it was trying to be deep and funny at the same time without managing to do one  and get ready for slow motion shots every 5 minutes  tldr  stereotype mess bad storytelling and shitty slow motion
Dec 30 2023,negative,a woefully deritive cliche    i dont know how seven other directors havent sued over the blatant plagiarism of star wars lord of the rings game of thrones guardians of the galaxy and thor to name a few its not even subtle that might be just about be excusable if they could disguise it inside a half decent story line but this is just one pantomime cliche followed by another in a sequence that could be predicted by a 5 year old a real shame given the extent of the casts potential talent they must have known how basic this was smells rife of cash before quality    jj
Dec 30 2023,positive,its a great movie with clear flaws the main cast arent very interesting too many slowmo scenes and some bad cgi but i respect zack snyders vision for this movie and i did enjoy it its clearly influenced by star wars but still does it own thing people expected star wars and did not receive it  which is good in my opinion looking forward to part 2
Dec 30 2023,positive,beautiful fx and nice visuals but the story and characters needed major development it had a lot of potential but fell short of snyders much older movies  story and plot is everything nice cgi and fx can only take you so far
Dec 30 2023,positive,i dont understand all the negativity about this movie i watched it with an open mind other than hoping for a star wars experience the original trilogy not the other money making dross that came after and was pleasantly surprised  rebel moon is much needed in the recent times of marvel domination in that its a film that does what it should entertain   and on a plus point it sets up that feeling of anticipation for the next part of what has been billed as a trilogy and until then a syndercut
Dec 30 2023,positive,why must all of these critics and keyboard warriors expect that media is going to change their lives seriously its a move and a good one it doesnt have to convey some kind of life epiphany are you not entertained these are the same people that hated empire strikes back aliens t2 and matrix before they loved them
Dec 30 2023,positive,great visuals story falls flat but still an entertaining movie
Dec 30 2023,positive,i wanted to like it but its just a copy of other sci fi films you having a feeling of deja vu as your watching it also slow motion is fine in small doses but this film is loaded with em
Dec 30 2023,negative,a half arsed copy of star wars and a few other franchises i was constantly distracted by how bad this movie was written the narrative was so lazy every twist is predictable youll feel used at the ending
Dec 30 2023,neutral,from the very first scene i knew the movie had all the right elements action great characters stupendous fight scenes and a worthy heroine then the gloss wore off each of the fascinating new seven samurai characters were tossed in without explanation or background we were expected to mentally pick them up and ride with it this movie that should have been at least split into two and given more effort given to character development sadly disappointed
Dec 30 2023,negative,shitty star wars copy where no one is interesting at all
Dec 30 2023,positive,very good movie kept me interested from start to finish
Dec 30 2023,negative,was a rehash of better science fiction films only more boring
Dec 30 2023,negative,a waste of time and money
Dec 30 2023,negative,this movie would be 30 minutes long if it werent for all the slomo
Dec 30 2023,negative,a story as obvious as it is pleasant to view
Dec 30 2023,negative,its like watching a parody movie without the laughs epic scifi effects fail to resurrect a slow dying pile of sheep poo
Dec 30 2023,positive,the movie is good and i really love it looking forward for part 2
Dec 30 2023,negative,its sad to see someone at the end of their career this desperate
Dec 30 2023,positive,was entertaining and the characters werent too bad but for the ending i like the play on the bolshevik revolution and evils of communism however the climax falls into the cliche and lazy writing of getting backstabbed by the guy we all saw a mile away but the heros easily turn the table and use the situation to their advance to put a nice closing for them
Dec 30 2023,positive,we need a 20 movie universe outa this
Dec 30 2023,negative,everything in this movie was obvious and flat the art direction was flat bland ships weapons locations the cgi was flat obvious and distracting the story was flat and built entirely off cliches shirtless american indian who easily communicates with animals asian sword matter cartoonish villains that are full of bloodlust and quest for power et al the acting was flat but they didnt have much to work with the excessive slowmo scenes felt old and recycled i guess they best thing about it was the action choreography but that isnt enough to sustain a movie for me    in the end i felt no emotions at all in this entirely forgettable movie    in the new scifi space the creator was much better in all aspects story characters worldbuilding art direction cinematography writing et al
Dec 30 2023,negative,definitely the worst movie i have watched in the past decade not sure how this even gets greenlit 
Dec 30 2023,negative,half way through and i lost all interest at the point that a particular us wannabe biker actor appears with a truly terrible irish accent playing a character so obviously based on han solo i understood why this film has so frequently been described as derivative especially as the prior scene is so obviously reminiscent of the bar scene also from the star wars films maybe it gets better but i cant be bothered
Dec 30 2023,positive,looks to be the beginning of a pretty cool and entertaining franchise  action sequences are downright awesome
Dec 30 2023,negative,a mashup of other better movies writing was weak as was the acting this story has been told much better before
Dec 30 2023,negative,the first half hour is promising but then its clear this is just a poorlywritten scifi 7 samurai the scenes where youre introduced to a new samurai are painfully cliche  almost like they were jacked from another movie like avatar i cant remember the last time i literally thought why the fk should i care this is happening     impossible to suspend disbelief and enjoy this movie if your brain isnt damaged or youre like 12 hot expensive overhyped garbage
Dec 30 2023,negative,i wouldnt even call it a fullfledged movie its more like a collection of gathered and cut stories that resemble teasers for different parts of the same game where you have to assemble a team of companions to fight the main boss none of the characters evoke any emotions neither good nor bad and the action is set up very boringly its a dumb dull graphically poor stylistically unrefined movie deeply disappointed
Dec 30 2023,negative,premature joke of a movie with below mediocre cgi zero character development tropes galore unrealistic converstions and around 14 yearold mental state for every character it is deliberately chosen probably for the target audience above 16 years of age this movie not recommended to watch cause it is cringe and tropefest all the way world design is bad and incoherent zero environment details zero environmental story telling bad cgi is all you get the supermodel heroine pulling the plow is the icing on the cake more lame cannot be waste of money waste of time
Dec 30 2023,positive,i know weak story and some copied characters from other movies but the visuals are really beautiful
Dec 30 2023,negative,the story is superficial and predictable and the acting is quite poor i was expecting at least some engaging action and cgi bit this also falls short and feels gratuitous
Dec 30 2023,neutral,visually impressive yet the story fails to deliver a heavy enough spark think a bugs life only live action and in space with heavy star wars influences
Dec 30 2023,positive,im going to classify it as the best movie of the year it is impressive and impeccable every detail shot and setting actually met my expectations
Dec 30 2023,negative,i love pretty much all of his movies but this weird failed star wars movie is absolute trash look forward to his next project not rebel moon
Dec 30 2023,negative,a purely visual spectacle and not even a great one at that hidden behind a muddy filter every scene is farcically derivative of star wars battle beyond the stars warhammer 40k turok and many other better sources boutella just isnt leading lady material characters are zero dimensional points its gratingly expositional and the action scenes are comically ineptly choreographed burdened with jumpcuts and slowslowslowermotions it feels like an episodic tv show crammed into a badly edited 2 14 hours that feels much longer and ends with a jarringly pointless to be continued  but why film why  why continue
Dec 30 2023,positive,i thought it was a good movie  i really enjoyed it 
Dec 30 2023,positive,if you like action and fantasy you will like this 
Dec 30 2023,positive,great movie great director  eager to see the 2nd part
Dec 30 2023,negative,visually pretty terrible story telling
Dec 30 2023,negative,i dislike that movie who greenlit it the story the pacing and the acting is horrible the lead actress cant act and the others have basically no lines it shouldnt be hard to deliver a 2h14 good movie from a veteran filmmaker without having to wait for the rrated version with s blood and probably more interaction between the lifeless characters i hope it stops here
Dec 30 2023,positive,this movie had everything i love about scifi including some fun new concepts and presentations the cast did a great job and had some of my favourite action stars what i wasnt expecting was everyone to be so dang easy on the eyes miss boutella did a phenomenal job as usual and the action sequences did not disappoint i cant wait for the next one 
Dec 30 2023,positive,i love a scifi but as i watched it i realised its the magnificent seven more or less but it was okay
Dec 30 2023,negative,nothing is a boring as cgi without a compelling story or interesting characters
Dec 30 2023,negative,was it terrible no it was just ok enough to want to see the next scene they stole from a different scifi movie think this would be a great drinkingtrivia movie for sure
Dec 30 2023,negative,predictable boring uncharismatic characters  ungrateful true people give too much hype for a director who is just ok deal with it
Dec 30 2023,neutral,the best scenarios getty god 
Dec 30 2023,negative,how anyone finishes the movie is a mystery to me the acting is atrocious the story is boring and predictable i think they filmed a scene and wrote a story around it it was so slow i the action scenes werent enjoyable
Dec 30 2023,negative,honestly and i dont want to be a hatter it was the worst movie of 2023 that i watched and i watch almost a movie every day everyone had high expectations for the movie some said it could even surpass star wars original movies overal horrible story bad performers abusive sgibut the worst was the disconnection between everything trying to mix several stories into one with zero originallity and abusive slow motion scenes
Dec 30 2023,negative,a story so tiredcharacters so twodimensionalhow does a budget this big get wasted on tripe like this
Dec 30 2023,negative,succinct review  epic cringe
Dec 30 2023,negative,all the money but storylines and attention to detail was way off some very very good scenes but as a movies goes no good
Dec 30 2023,positive,good not the best its what it is
Dec 30 2023,negative,honestly one of the worst movies i ever watched    visually you can see the millions that went into it but everything still looks incredibly cheap and badly made there is motion blurr everywhere and slomo in every single fight the characters and story progression dont make sense at all    it feels like it was written by ai to include all major tropes big budget effects and character archetypes and just randomly string them together without reason or cohesion no sequel can fix this mess of a story    snyder is a bad cinematographer but an even worse director
Dec 30 2023,positive,movie was good looking forward to part 2
Dec 30 2023,negative,baddies are coming get some goodies destroy the baddies by pulling a lever   nothing new nothing exciting looked like a perfume ad imagine creating a universe as dull as this
Dec 30 2023,negative,so much slow motion letting you see how boring the film is in detail and so many accents
Dec 30 2023,positive,sci fi fantasy nerds this is your mixtape i loved it and my brain checked out trying to count the bits and bobs from my most favorite in this genre it was fun
Dec 30 2023,negative,not an original idea in it oh this is the seven samurai this part is stolen from star wars on and on like that
Dec 30 2023,positive,zack snyders rebel moon catapults audiences into an expansive galactic odyssey that blends dazzling visuals with an intriguing narrative as a fan of snyders distinctive style i eagerly delved into this space epic snyders signature visual flair is evident in every frame elevating the movie to a cinematic spectacle a child of fire serves as the inaugural installment in a series of adventures one notable aspect is its ambitious attempt to construct a comprehensive universe however its drawback lies in the challenge of functioning seamlessly as a standalone movie the films emphasis on universebuilding while commendable may hinder its effectiveness as an independent cinematic experience
Dec 30 2023,positive,great movie love it
Dec 30 2023,negative,this was painful to watch a frankensteinesque patchwork of déjàvu scenes from harry potter the witcher lotr hunger games dune and many many more sewn together with blurry seams a a heavy coating of snyderslomo   basically no original thought would not be surprised if it was later revealed that chatgpt was behind it from the start
Dec 30 2023,negative,unoriginal and forced
Dec 30 2023,negative,really really bad the story line was very basic and uninteresting the only entertainment from this movie was the visual effects and the eye candy actorsaside from that there is absolutely no substance to the story very disappointing
Dec 30 2023,negative,simply bad story full of characters you dont care for sequence of scenes that supposedly had to help build the world and characters but fails to drag the viewer in watching it i only wanted it to finish and entertained myself with thoughts in how many different ways same story could be told in much much better ways
Dec 30 2023,negative,cant even give movies good ratings for effects anymore  good effects are so common now  this story set new levels of cliché it is so unoriginal and forced that it is actually painful to watch
Dec 30 2023,negative,simply it just sucked slow and forgettable
Dec 30 2023,positive,great movie dont know why it got so much hate that much slo mo and im all for it i dont know why people see that as a problem i feel like the people who do not like this movie are just nit picking its hard to please the nerds
Dec 30 2023,negative,formulaic and predictable made it about 75 of the way through before giving up having seen this before in about 100 other uninspired movies pretty though
Dec 30 2023,positive,very engaging and visually appealing rapid sequence and enmeshed interplay of characters hopefully we will get more emotional depth as the series expands but most definitely worth watching
Dec 30 2023,positive,i found it was enough to keep me interested  almost a mishmash of a bunch of sci fi stories that isnt bad but isnt great either  again enough to keep me entertained by a non existent plot
Dec 30 2023,negative,rebel moon is what you would get if you ordered star wars from wish
Dec 30 2023,negative,putting lipstick on a pig doesnt make it any thing else same old overpowered female trope im rooting for this insurgency to be crushed
Dec 30 2023,positive,nothing ground breaking here but all in all good cinematic good ai effects ok though predictable plot and something fungreat to watch  for what it is trying to be its 5
Dec 30 2023,neutral,harry potter from 2001 had better cgi than this
Dec 30 2023,negative,it was butt not worth the bandwidth to stream it
Dec 30 2023,negative,the characters are shoehorned into the story the plot is railroaded and completely rebooted from star wars nearly scene by scene but hey the parts that arent unnecessarily blurry are really pretty
Dec 30 2023,positive,i enjoyed the movie the storyline was cool and it had lots of cool graphics
Dec 30 2023,positive,great visuals and character development for pt 1 overall history  world building seemed interesting space fascist are always a great enemy i did unfortunately dislike the climax as it seemed very rushed predictable and honestly just dumb imo
Dec 30 2023,positive,much better than i expected it was fantastic
Dec 30 2023,positive,very cool movie pretty good original story with awesome special effects despite the critic reviews which i dont trust these days i think this movie is going to catch on the so called professional critics definitely got this one wrong this movie is going to be huge and finally for once we dont have to wait years for the next part to premiere 
Dec 30 2023,negative,the worst storyline i have seen in years written by a 13 year old or an ai
Dec 30 2023,negative,this is not a good movie i wanted to be entertained but nothing here is entertaining nothing at all original uninspiring boring so much slo mo even the big dramatic scenes were laughable  i just wanted this movie to end  its battlefield earth all over again
Dec 30 2023,positive,it just looked great and had cool characters 1 of zacks best work cant wait for pt2
Dec 30 2023,positive,this was a great movie great story awesome fx amazing cinematography the pace was a little fast but i think it worked in the movies favor it keeps your interest with the plot and plot twists cant wait for part 2
Dec 30 2023,negative,i dont care who made it its drivel way too many good actors cant save this nonsense rips off magnificent sevens story and does nothing with it all in slowmotion
Dec 30 2023,negative,enough with the girl power nonsense 120 pound cutie single handedly takes out like 20 jocko looking dudes and thats just in the first 30 minutes and the rest of the movie is equally stupid
Dec 30 2023,positive,overall it is a great movie had my attention it was not cliché but you need to pay attention to details to really see how the story connects itseft otherwise why would the motherboards admiral go to such small farmer village  i hope they improve few things for part 2 like to better developer the characters
Dec 30 2023,neutral,i was hoping for better nothing ground breaking but also not horrible  the movie was shot beautifully but the lead who played kora felt wooden with her acting and the side characters werent provided enough screen time to flesh out there characters  explaining their backstory is different than getting a feel for the characters through their interactions with each other
Dec 30 2023,negative,couldnt even finish it it felt like someone told ai to create a movie from star wars game of thrones foundation and maybe macgruber im putting together a team and this is what it spewed out admittedly i have found most of zack snyders work bad to very bad so maybe im just a hater
Dec 30 2023,negative,this is such a dumb movie  it started off dumb and just kept getting dumber  a world with spaceships that can destroy civilization and bend space dont need bushels of grain from psuedo futuristic farmers that use horses to till and a fireplace to warm their homes yet have a metal electronic sliding doors that i assume use electricity  of course how can i forget the weird kings army that has uniforms that are a cross between a nazi army ancient persian military looking alien advisors and halo dressed warriors    fancy special effects cant make up for this terrible movie    dumb dumb dumb
Dec 30 2023,positive,battle beyond the stars  magnificent seven with better production values and a higher budget denzel did it better
Dec 30 2023,negative,it felt like 10 scenes were given to 10 different writers and none were allowed to speak to each other  this film is an incoherent rambling mess
Dec 30 2023,negative,nothing terribly compelling about it   its long and slow and not terribly original  there are too many scenes that are so evocative of star wars that you wonder how much they just copied from them  i dont have any real excitement to see part 2 when it comes out  but if it gets good reviews i would
Dec 30 2023,negative,this was a star wars moviel had no idea also there was better cgi 20 years ago
Dec 30 2023,negative,i knew it was going south as soon as the cliche of a horse drawn plow and farming village collided with them using electric lights    stir in a few imperial soldiers with zero discipline and a physics defying waterfall from a hill  you have probably the worst opening of any movie ever    just unspeakably bad
Dec 30 2023,positive,the movie is different  and liked the action sequences some of the art was really good i cant wait to see the 2nd one
Dec 30 2023,negative,quite the train wreck of scifi tropes and blatantly ripped off material and no meaningful story
Dec 30 2023,positive,derivative and largely unoriginal yes but better acting sets story and acting than most of the star wars films its worth a watch
Dec 29 2023,positive,visually stunning  being a long time scifi fan this has elements from all the classics  it also has a destiny feel to it imho
Dec 29 2023,positive,theres a lot of logic gaps  why would a dreadnought ship want to buy 10 bushels of something from a farm in the middle of nowhere  theres almost zero humour why not tell a few jokes    people shouting and running when blasters are being fired is silly theyre not running faster than the plasma bullets  they probably need a lightsaber type person to deflect bullets to make it interesting because it doesnt matter how strong someone is they can be easily shot and killed  the imagery is impressive and its emotionally moving in parts rebel commanders death just the tone is almost continuously orchestral  its hard not to be impressed but it does let itself down    finally why are the evil guys all talking with irish accents
Dec 29 2023,negative,nothing new or original and the slow motion in every action sequence gets old very fast
Dec 29 2023,positive,this is what the star wars sequels should have been like great action and great special effects and also great actingi am looking forward to part two
Dec 29 2023,positive,found the last action predictable but the story is original more or less great acting and cinematography  its the beginning of a great story  worth a watch
Dec 29 2023,negative,well what can i say this is my first review this is how much i want the two hours of my life back this film is a star wars rip off i mean they had to go to a dump of a bar to find a pilot i think i think was was drooling at this pointthe characters have nothing going for them you dont learn anything about them its the story has been told about a million times and its not worth your money jump over just what star wars the first one and each something 100 better even c3po legged out of this film only to turn up at the end and the slow motion i honestly thought i was going to see my first ever slow mo toilet seen its bad the cgi is good in placeshow can nothing happen for 2 hours the pilot is wait what am i saying i didnt dectet a plot just a load of shirtless olid up studmuffins just sat there waiting to win there fight i cant think of anything to compare it to just a star wars rip off dose hollywood just throw money at anyone now days if so i am on it with my script called the shin strap redemptionpeace out
Dec 29 2023,negative,really bland and forgettable the characters were so underdeveloped and it was so derivative in the story department would not recommend at all
Dec 29 2023,negative,what a mess visuals were unnecessarily blurry a sideeffect of the lens used during filming unfortunately poorly colorcorrected and a fair amount of the effects looked unfinished     neither the plot nor character arcs go anywhere meaningful even if this is a part one of two situation charlie hunnams performance in particular is one of the worst ive seen in some time and sofia boutellas can be described as nothing more than quiet farmer wearing a cape     people say there is a longer rrated cut of this coming and ill be completely honest here if the first cut of your film is this bad youve killed any interest i had in a directors cut
Dec 29 2023,positive,thought the movie was well done kept me entertained throughout the pacing seemed just right to me i liked the way they introduced characters all in all i thought it was great and ill be looking forward to part 2
Dec 29 2023,negative,formulaic star wars wannabe  no new ground broken here  the characters are stiff and onedimensional if that and completely uninvolving it feels like it should have been based on a book which might have given it some excuse to say that it hewed too closely or strayed too far away from the original but apparently thats not the case  theres no one else to blame  if it were free and running in the background while you were on a treadmill thats about the right level of investment  definitely no need or desire to see a part 2
Dec 29 2023,negative,boring and so forgettable very disappointing
Dec 29 2023,negative,where to start with this waste of 2 hours    look i will just answer the parts you all care about the action scenes even suck now that thats out of the way and you know you can skip it    the dialogue seems to have come from a middle school level drama the character development is really quick and in your face at first then suddenly just disappears its absolutely jarring the pace is atrocious and the amount of holes in the movies plot and development could fit the milky way im really not sure what to think i know im not going to be looking for episode 2 as this shamble of a show illustrated that maybe zack should stick to directing others writing as his is pretty much bottom of the barrel
Dec 29 2023,neutral,the movie isnt that bad but it is very choppy and doesnt flow very well the visuals are really pretty good the biggest problem that this film has is sofia boutella is completely unlikeable the hero needs to be somewhat likeable and heroic sofia boutella is neither of those she makes you want to cheer for the bad guy
Dec 29 2023,positive,this movie has a bit of everything from bugs life to star wars to game of thrones  excellent scifi
Dec 29 2023,positive,this movie took a little bit to introduce the characters and storyline lol thats normal of a new movie that is trying to create a bug world this movie was awesome and the future movies i hope are just as good
Dec 29 2023,negative,where to begin tropish cliche pretentious and boring its a rip off of every other sci fi  western plot the bar scene was pulled right from star wars
Dec 29 2023,positive,entertaining no its not superbly original or groundbreaking but it is visually interesting sports characters that you can root for and paves the way for a universe of heroes and villains fun 
Dec 29 2023,negative,what an absolute mess of a movie a dogs breakfast of dialogue disconnected scenes boring snoozeinducing back story clueless over the top all madman bad guys groan and more bad accents all at once than some crazy overdubbed 1990s anime just  yikes not sure which i care less about the good guys weak the bad guys dumb or the i watched the seven samurai in college thirty years ago wafer thin plot 100 forgettable
Dec 29 2023,positive,honestly what more do you need epic sci fi more please
Dec 29 2023,negative,bad scénario too slow slowmotion scenes totally boring i stopped after 37 min i like scifi but this film was worse than cheaper series from canada 
Dec 29 2023,positive,literally the best scifi movie in the universe
Dec 29 2023,negative,it looks fantastic but the writing and pacing is lazy you want it to be good and it could have been so good but the melodrama and regurgitation of every other scifi and action trope makes for a confusing hodgepodge you feel like youre meant to care but you cant think why
Dec 29 2023,positive,this could have been so much more as it was the plot was without imagination and lacked creativity acting was over the top with a lot of screaming while shooting kind of thing visually it was nice overall as a scifi fan it was good better than a lot of scifi out there but it could have been so much more and so much longer and more detailed its like zak tried to crush 6 hours of a story into a 2 hr movie
Dec 29 2023,negative,words fail me lifeless empty just boring
Dec 29 2023,positive,i can see why the top critics panned this film i nearly gave up after the first few minutes as it looked like it would be a weak low budget boring affair but how wrong i was once the characters are introduced and developed over the first part of the film the pace slowly ramps up and up and i got carried along on what is an exciting ride with great characters as good as those in the super hero movies and you could almost see this film in manga form with its style and action sequences im glad i stayed the distance and cant wait for part 2 already dont believe the downbeat critic reviews which whilst understandable from the first few minutes i think are disappointed its a fairly simple premise like star wars was lol a fabulous film but at its core good vs bad albeit done with incredible mastery by all concerned give rebel moon a chance i dont think youll be disappointed and maybe youll love it as much as i do bring it on
Dec 29 2023,positive,visually stunning overall thought it was entertaining
Dec 29 2023,negative,rating says meh it passed the time but it felt like i wasted my time nice visuals and makeup the plot and pacing though were ridiculous  more like watching various cutscenes from an epic video game and with similar plot jumps  go here collect character build party have fight  pass trial and absolutely no context  the spider thing continue on almost zero character development beyond the main character     spoiler  got to the last big scene  fight of the movie and i thought wait this isnt the end of the movie already they basically got tricked to land at the equivalent of a warehouse loading bay andoh the big bad is here uh tension capture escape fight explosions loss of importantbutnotreally character reflect on challenges overcome oh and apparently a fivestory space warship can be crashed by flicking a single switch from the gunners chair  sp off    check that i cant even give it two stars the more i think back    if you completely check your brain at the door or like to download and watch fancy scifi screensavers then you might get 2 hours of entertainment out of this    just pass on it until the full cut is released next year  maybe that will be worth it
Dec 29 2023,positive,fun space opera enjoyable characters epic scenery and exciting fight scenes  story line typical of scify space operas
Dec 29 2023,negative,one of the worst films ive ever seen pacing feels completely wrong and so many unnecessary moments
Dec 29 2023,negative,this is definitely the most ridiculous movie ive ever seen so bad that i had to keep watching expecting it to be less bad i was surprised that they came up with this movie a copy of at least 5 different movies my god the even copied the gladiator and brought the same actor  the worst movie
Dec 29 2023,positive,exceptional this will be the first brick of a marvelous universe
Dec 29 2023,negative,the writing is soooooo bad  no wonder lucasfilm did not want it sooooo soooooo bad
Dec 29 2023,positive,i am really sick of critics especially after it became the fashion among them to pan this film i waited for the dull plot to begin dragging down the action ummm it never happened i watched as all sorts of twists and turns kept me riveted the action was spectacular and the special effects awesome your critical reviews were strangely alike and totally worthless i cant wait for part 2
Dec 29 2023,positive,i actually liked it despise bad reviews it wasnt something spectacular but it had ok plot and really beatiful looking worlds it was full of cgi but it was still well made movie im waiting for part 2
Dec 29 2023,positive,its like warhammer 40k mixed with star wars vikings and heavy metal  whats not to like
Dec 29 2023,positive,very well done   i do wonder how many times i must read professional reviews that repeat themselves saying i want something new but these reviewers  repeat themselves nothing is new for them   while not a perfect story we travel to world were we entertained and can pass the time  snyders style is his creative many time times with new ideas many times looking and using the past all movies and books do the same  great way to pass a few hours i look forward to part 2
Dec 29 2023,negative,he should have just come out and sad he was doing a sci fi remake of the magnificent seven i have watched it twice and this movie is just a mess
Dec 29 2023,negative,is bad how they did the history is interesting but they make it so dumb for a 4 year old kid sad it is as these way made producer or director error horror 
Dec 29 2023,neutral,ive seen everything before in other films that told their story better however the movie is nicely made and i miss good science fiction so im still waiting for part 2 and i regret that this one is not better it has potential
Dec 29 2023,negative,this is a less compelling version of a bugs life the characters are either dressed as 1800s american settlers or as steampunk nazis i hope the good bugs band together to defeat the grasshoppers in part two
Dec 29 2023,positive,i really dont understand the vitriol i thought it was great was it like other scifi space operas yes was the story super original no but it was visually stunning and engaging enough to not be even close to boring sofia boutella is amazing as is ed skrein ray fisher is always solid i loved it and cant wait until the part 2
Dec 29 2023,positive,i felt the movie was a good shootemup with lots of action i respect rebels because they have to fight the man and it is tough to fight the man the rebels were heroes and they were fighting a very mean establishment that establishment was seriously mean and snaky although i shouldnt call them snaky because snakes are just doing their thing mean has nothing to do with it
Dec 29 2023,positive,this was a really good movie storyline and cinematography was different from the norm not sure why it has bad reviews
Dec 29 2023,negative,i was excited to see this but after 20 mins i turned it off it was boring then i thought i will give it another shot maybe it will get better it didnt i only watched 45 mins it is so bad i rarely stop watching a movie so for me to stop watching it it has to be really bad
Dec 29 2023,negative,incredibly bad film repeating the main devices and plotlines of classic scifi films would be fine if they could make the story or the characters even remotely interesting and engaging you feel no connection with the characters and its unclear why many of them are even there the costume summed up the movie when they put the bad guy into a shirt and tie yes in a scifi film set in another timespace where apparently the hardest thing to do is grow some food absolutely ridiculously bad film never seen anything worse
Dec 29 2023,positive,not a great movie but good and i was entertained it is way better than the low score the critics gave it
Dec 29 2023,neutral,i really wanted this movie to be great after what disney has done to star wars i was hoping someone would give us a new scifi franchise that was exciting and interesting but unfortunately rebel moon isnt it i feel it would have made for a better series than it did movie it felt rushed and it didnt give me the character building and back story i was wanting hopefully the extended version and part 2 will give me more of what i was hoping for it was visually appealing but way too much slow motion
Dec 29 2023,positive,i actually like it a lot sure they borrowed things from here and there but really who doesnt the only really original scyfy i can remember is leviathan the serie from au  now what i did appreciate superbe visual and someone who knows what atmos sound is really about now i saw the trailer for part 2 and what everybody say is missing will be reveiled to me it was great entertainement
Dec 29 2023,positive,is was goodnot great glad the part 2 isnt as long of a wait as the part 2 of mission impossible
Dec 29 2023,negative,terrible such a waste of potentially great premise
Dec 29 2023,negative,really interesting visuals and special effects but the storyline and script was trash
Dec 29 2023,negative,awful weak plot visually appealing zero relationship building between characters who after a short interaction got recruited into a rebellion dialogue was just sad i wanted to like this save yourself some time and skip it 
Dec 29 2023,negative,this was a hard watch the scenes many of which seem to be repurposed from older scifi films seemed almost entirely disconnected from each other the character writing is nonexistent there was no reason to care about any of them although the movie is nice enough to tell us about a romantic subplot it never showed its not actually a story just assembling a thin cast to tell us there will be a story if someone took the opening scenes from suicide squad removed the music and stretched them out to a full length film you would have about the same experience with more color
Dec 29 2023,negative,derivative and a poor repeat of seven samurai
Dec 29 2023,positive,fantastic film the action plot and performances were excellent this movie was a pleasant surprise
Dec 29 2023,positive,great popcorn movie does what it needs to do entertain chapter two looks very promising and really look forward to it
Dec 29 2023,negative,i was excited for this movie and ended up being extremely disappointed  i tried to find one conversation in the entire movie that actually felt real ie would real people actually say this  the beginning was ok the viking village was a cool idea  the slow motion was awful  i could write several pages with all the issues i had but to sum up its honestly the worst movie ive ever seen and that was so disappointing because i had genuine excitement for this film  the trailers were very good
Dec 29 2023,negative,star wars for ptsd affected lgtb  interstellar losers
Dec 29 2023,negative,the film is awful and especially the scenario how something that bad exists 
Dec 29 2023,negative,just terrible derivative story woeful script gormless acting laughable cgi bizarre directorial choices a lens flare for every scene aeons of exposition leaden pacing from the opening sequence when our hero is lovingly grasping fistfuls of soil in a quasisexual manner through the tortuously uninteresting assembly of the seven nouveau samurai and on and on through the swamp of dull setup for part two this film goes nowhere and does very little and what it does do takes twice as long as it should it wouldnt know an original idea if it jumped up and bit it unless its out of morbid curiosity id avoid this lumpen mishmash of other peoples poorly rendered ideas at all costs 2 hours and 14 minutes of your life youll never get back
Dec 29 2023,positive,loved it and im so looking forward to watching the extended version and part 2  charlie hunnam as kai is amazing  
Dec 29 2023,positive,for some reason critics can no longer be trusted this was fantastic with lots of action and some good laughs is it a 1010 story no is it a highly entertaining scifi action movie yes
Dec 29 2023,positive,this movie is getting bad reviews because it glorifies a rebellion against an empire thats not been allowed since the original  star wars because it inspires firefly tried it and was sabotage only two succeeded after it was canceled i loved this movie you will too
Dec 29 2023,positive,it was actually a lot better than i was expecting    my only real gripe was how similar some scenes felt to other movies oh and the bad guy wearing a shirt and tie like he was going to the office was pretty stupid looking
Dec 29 2023,positive,great movie cant wait for part 2
Dec 29 2023,positive,normally i feel the critics are accurate with their reviews i dont get the negative vibes for rebel moon the action set pieces are fantastic the diverse cast give strong performances the story is a bit predictable but most science fiction flicks are these days the film does a nice job of telling a story introducing characters while setting the stage for the 2nd film my teenage boys loved it a good popcorn movie
Dec 29 2023,negative,this movie is among the most stupid ones ive ever seen everything is so literal the characters spend their time explaining why they do what they do to make sure that we the poor stupid audience clearly understand what we absolutely must understand the characters have no stakes its blatantly obvious its unbearable i hate it when a director treats me like an idiot
Dec 29 2023,positive,absolutely amazing movie exactly what keeps driving science fiction and fantasy films a must watch
Dec 29 2023,negative,the constant slow motion cinematography felt so out of placed and over used that the actual effect it was supposed to have became a miss the cast was heavily underused as the film tried to balance itself between being a scifi thriller and a grind house film     plot was extremely lacking as the entire glue for this ragtag band of heroes was to protect a farm from a force that we seen on screen level an entire kingdoms and worlds but 5 people could really whip farmers together to fight off that military force    the story seemed to have great things but they feel hidden behind a paywall made of a directors cut and a part ii
Dec 29 2023,negative,id echo what some of the critics have said a    boring star wars like rip off with no story there is nothing moving or motivating but pretty pictures and really good looking slomo
Dec 29 2023,positive,i enjoyed this movie because it has a really good story the cinematography is beautiful and the music fits perfect i wasnt sure if i was going to like it but i loved it very entertaining and i highly recommend watching it and having some popcorn with it
Dec 29 2023,positive,the movie was really good if you like scifi cool unique worlds and racesaliens dont read any further if you like what i just mentioned and just go watch it and enjoy     i believe it was intentional to not have all questions of the characters backgrounds answered more questions will likely be answered and certain things addressed in part 2 critics argued that it lacked substance but then if all questions would have been answered the critics would say the film was pandering nothing will ever please critics of most scifi because they have no imagination and make it difficult for the genre to succeed my only dislike of the film was the overuse of slow motion in action sequences it was still cool but a bit unnecessary i think
Dec 29 2023,negative,tasteless movie shallow plot rushed action scenes caricatured characters im not picky when it comes to action movies but this is the first time ive stopped watching before the end
Dec 29 2023,negative,absolutely waste of time incoherent storytelling and a blatant ripoff of warhammer 40k
Dec 29 2023,neutral,its an enjoyable watch there is just nothing new or interesting about it
Dec 29 2023,positive,ignore the haters and think for yourself finally an original scififantasy movie that lacks the nauseating stench of lucas i loved sharing some bonding time with my teenage daughter with this film and were excited for whats to come the effects were a health mix of cgi and mind bending live action stunts the story was a great set up for more stories to come the acting and script writing is far above par for genre i cant wait for more
Dec 29 2023,negative,i also made an account just to comment on this like a lot of people said it was predictable the acting was literally atrocious i knew right away that the brother wasnt going to be important dont know anything about any of the characters no background at all just quickly introduced them like we already had an idea didnt even see a connection between them to join up together no chemistry also how quick and easy it was to convince them all it was just lame
Dec 29 2023,positive,literally think this platform sucks but i logged in to give this movie the rating it deserves
Dec 29 2023,negative,visually spectacular but a 5 year old could tell a better story half of the scenes were incoherent and immaterial to the story and the reasons given for every plot development were shallow and frankly stupid
Dec 29 2023,negative,starting watching with my 11 year old son he said it was too cringe and boring then there was some action then more unlikable characters then we watched fail army instead its really bad
Dec 29 2023,negative,i cant believe someone spend all that money and wasted all those talented actors time in a movie as bad as this i mean the plot is a patchwork of non related topics most of which are dropped without any reason the characters a really poor caricatures and you dont get to connect with any of them and most of all the number of references if youre being nice or as i would call them straight up plagiarisms are the final detail on a total waste of time and money probably   i mean we got 7 samurais star wars wild west stuff gladiator and when you think its over even matrix on it and it still sucks    give yourself a favor and never watch this
Dec 29 2023,positive,what a good start to refuel all 0f us baby boomers
Dec 29 2023,positive,overall an enjoyable film though it is a bit derivative and is strangely paced the main set pieces are very watchable and have some interesting visual touches theres a lot going on and it seems that it would have been better as a miniseries with time to flesh out each of the characters the general structure of the seven samurai is to spend time building up the characters of the supporting squad so that their eventual deaths are meaningful here we spent a little too much time on the bad guys and search for the squad rather than on the squad themselves  thus we really dont care enough about the crew perhaps that work will be done in part two    in any case the visuals and action were enough diversion for a few hours
Dec 29 2023,negative,too many similarities with the story of thanos going into defeating multiple worlds saving a girl similarities with star wars and ray it definitely wasnt a clever storyline most of them were stolen ideas the action couldve been more gory and detailed the preview was definitely way more entertaining than the actual movie i give it one out of five stars i wish i could get my 2 12 hours back
Dec 29 2023,negative,bad movie obviously inspired in the seven samurai movie poor acting poor special effects
Dec 29 2023,positive,where it misses the mark in character development and plot it far exceeds in excitement and imagery the rt pro reviews say more about them than the movie
Dec 29 2023,negative,probably good for a teen going through their edgy phase but other than that its filled to the brim in cringe
Dec 29 2023,negative,it wasnt good it is a combination of every generic action scifi movie trope there is storyline is weak and character development is severely lacking the actual video looked nice with pretty solid special effects
Dec 29 2023,positive,a fascinating introduction to a new universe i want to see much more definitely much more interested in this than new star wars stuff
Dec 29 2023,positive,i really enjoyed the movie from start to finish i think critics are always searching for oscar performances and forget that movies are to entertain
Dec 29 2023,neutral,the film was entertaining from a visual effects perspective i appreciated that the story moved quickly however the plot was predictable and somehow felt like its been done before i found myself anticipating outcomes which materialized unfortunately this can make a film lack luster rating of 25 stars hopefully part 2 will provide unforeseen plot twist and more action
Dec 29 2023,positive,i think the movie would have benefitted from more back story about the ruling force but that being said it was enjoyable and worth the watch hope part two builds a more complete picture of this universe
Dec 29 2023,positive,its a great movie its enjoyable the scenes are great with acutal locations and cgi  the story is relatively simple and watch this to enjoy
Dec 29 2023,positive,enjoyable film it does have familiar themes but they are good themes
Dec 29 2023,positive,it must be cool these days to dump on movies as a past time this movie had good actors and actresses a decent story and great visual effects not every movie has to be thought provoking
Dec 29 2023,negative,look did i enjoy it yes it was worth the watch but was it great no far from it actually the best i could describe how i feel about this film was that it felt like a sequel film you get into these characters lives with barely any context or build up which creates the inability to buy in to the entire story i loved the casting they had the talent for an amazing film but scripting and character depth kept it from that this could have easily been a three part series again if youre just looking for a film to watch on a rainy day watch it
Dec 29 2023,positive,i loved the movie but you get tell that the pg13 version isnt the final version so much is missing from the action scenes but beyond that the characters i could connect with on an emotional level
Dec 29 2023,negative,this movie was total and complete garbage  no character development plot was lame and the cgi was horrible  a majority of the movie was like the rick and morty espisode where they make fun of heist films where they assemble a team of randos for the heist  hot freaking mess of a movie
Dec 29 2023,negative,terrible rehash of the seven samuraimagnificent seven and other films with a terrible nod to star wars    just trash story bad acting and poor lighting
Dec 29 2023,positive,yes its a broth of various scifi stock that said it filled a gap in the market for a decent space opera and i loved it may the schwartz be with you
Dec 29 2023,negative,so movie was very derivative   basically if you have seen seventh samuraimagnificent seven  star wars you know the basic plot   heck a post apocalyptic seventh samurai could be interesting but the character development is 0 in this movie so it misses the point  over used dark filter just further drags down the movie as everything is washed out   just overall not a good movie and not worth the time to watch it
Dec 29 2023,positive,epic filmmaking is what you get in rebel moon beautiful imagery with an interesting story does it hurt that you only get part of the story in one film maybe but im willing to wait until april to get my answers do you see reflections of other scifi franchises in rebel moon sure you do same as you do in most any scifi film im sold on the vision ready to wait for the payoff
Dec 29 2023,positive,loved this movie i think critics tend to hate most of these movies and thats ok great action i really enjoy the universe thats building it feels like a star wars universe but it isnt
Dec 29 2023,positive,was a brilliant movie and a breath of fresh air to see an original film series start out my only criticism is that it did not go on long enough    brilliant visuals unexpected twists and a story and characters that i loved almost immediately
Dec 29 2023,negative,visual effects and music and the effort of the actors is why this gets 2 stars other than that booooo
Dec 29 2023,negative,every part of this is predictable poorly written and pretty much just star wars i hope they dont make more
Dec 29 2023,negative,i made my first account to comment on this film please never again zero stars who ever directed this should be flipping burgers for a living
Dec 29 2023,positive,wtf how is this so low did i watch a completly different movie than the other 37 procent so happy this movie is breaking records and being no1 worldwide more of this please
Dec 29 2023,positive,actually enjoyed this despite the negative reviews follow me on instagram legendsloungetvandfilm
Dec 28 2023,positive,now this is cinema
Dec 28 2023,positive,i hade the great honor watching this movie with my parents we all loved it it was so fun fresh and vibrant can not wait for part 2 this is truly one of those movies for the fans not critics
Dec 28 2023,negative,every scene and every line is dark and depressing throughout  not one character is worth caring about  it was just a dark pointless waste of a few hours  ive seen b movies with better characters and production
Dec 28 2023,negative,complete and utter trash  i really wanted to like this but i knew this movie was in trouble when the first scene is a ship and portal that resembled genitals   really  the dialogue was bad  the backstory hodgepodge  despite some actions sequences the movie at times was dull  some of the design was completely uninspired  there was about 20 minutes of a good movie and the rest was just terrible
Dec 28 2023,positive,beautifully shot palpable action great underrated ensemble cast interesting characters and a ton of heart  a bit rushed at times but im looking forward part 2 and the extended cuts
Dec 28 2023,negative,ouch looks good sour on the inside couldnt turn it off fast enough v disappointing pace story and lack of care for the characters 
Dec 28 2023,negative,in italy we have a song that says you are the copy of a thousand summaries this film does everything to please and has nothing to say its reminiscent of kurosawas seven samurai but with a lot of cgi or little soul
Dec 28 2023,positive,i cannot say i truly enjoyed the movie
Dec 28 2023,positive,its a simple straightforward fun movie with absolutely stunning visuals sure the plot seemed to stall for a while but not enough for me to take my eyes off it
Dec 28 2023,positive,great story very reminiscent of star wars while keeping an original feel
Dec 28 2023,neutral,zack borrows heavily from other sources which isnt a bad thing but even though they spent a lot of money to make it look good it feels like an 80s move surfing the space wave star wars started and cast feels like they rounded a bunch of people up at a comic con and let them write the movie on the fly   absolutely average
Dec 28 2023,positive,it entertained me it can have its cringy and predictable moments and its basically  magnificent seven in space but i like both so its a yes for me looking forward to see what another cut brings and part 2 and hoping it gets a little better
Dec 28 2023,negative,wish i hadnt bothered watching this at the cinema no character development no development of the plot no good acting in sight felt like they rushed to make this
Dec 28 2023,positive,sometimes people reviews just shocking and this is such a case  rebel moon amazing movie it has everything you expect from modern scifi interesting world story characters great fights fantastic graphics its beautiful entertaining and fun to watch   does it has cliches yes does it has parallels with other great movies yea does it make this movie bad no
Dec 28 2023,negative,whoever wrote this movie needs to stop  i enjoyed the visuals and some of the characters but the storyline was a train wreck
Dec 28 2023,negative,ill watch the r rated version
Dec 28 2023,negative,worst movie i have seen in 2023 extremely slow nothing happen for 80 mins very disappointing cheap final battle movie finale is a star wars wannabe stuff looking forward to seeing how bad is part 2
Dec 28 2023,negative,possibly the worst film ive seen it felt like it stole ideas off of many great films and didnt try to hide the fact it was stealing them great actors but a poorly written script
Dec 28 2023,neutral,it is generally true that if you create characters in a story that are so vibrant dynamic flawed relatable and cunning that they themselves will tell the story for you  apparently the character bios created here before preproduction were about one paragraph each im not sure what this team was trying to do its like painting a picture with a single brush stroke its not going to turn out anything like what you intended and youll end up with an incomplete and unsatisfying result you are not always able to depend on visual effects or a directors cut
Dec 28 2023,negative,this is an awful movie i have no idea why anyone would choose to make it on d they had read the script its appalling bad
Dec 28 2023,negative,terrible and unbelievable script wooden acting and utterly predictable action scenes it was just annoying regarding the scripts premise  this super rich world conquering society needs grain from farmers on a remote planet please
Dec 28 2023,negative,this was a total misser bad story the pace of the movie does not make sense the acting is not the best but specially the overuse of slowmotion in the battles got me very annoyed its a pity i was hoping i would be at least decent   i like other movies of zack but not this one   
Dec 28 2023,neutral,the character introduction and backstory is bad or abscent
Dec 28 2023,negative,horrible drivel  plot was weak  terrible use of charlie hunnams acting abilities and a weak female lead  dont waste your time
Dec 28 2023,negative,this movie reminded me of a story i have wrote when i was 12 years old same storyline great threat collect xy and z betrayal and so on and of course due to my age they lacked character development and context for anything no memorable characters or no meaningful relationship developed back then i remember that after reading it again i figured it was not so great so i decided to do with it what you do with garbage stories toss them in a drawer and forget about them or even better repurpose the paper little did i know it had the exact requirements for a hollywood  movie and at an early age i have written something equivalent with one of the great writers in the industry oh my how the quality of movies and storytelling has dropped
Dec 28 2023,positive,i enjoyed this movie seemed a cross between star wars and hunger games
Dec 28 2023,positive,the movie is enjoyable the story is a little slow but the action and video effects are great
Dec 28 2023,negative,boring cliche hard to suspend disbelief
Dec 28 2023,positive,very good movie totally recommended
Dec 28 2023,positive,reminded me of chronicles of riddick might not be as good as that movie but i still enjoyed watching it
Dec 28 2023,negative,visually fun but poorly paced grittier remake of battle beyond the stars which in turn was a remake of the seven samurai trying to cash in on star wars history repeats itself
Dec 28 2023,positive,the introduction of 4 characters through planet hopping was weak  i hope this world is expanded upon as it seems rich with new ideas  the mood is consistent and dark but this could have been written differently with the similar effect
Dec 28 2023,positive,i like the concept and the universe it feels like some producers got ahold of the directors movie and did their own editing i hear there is another version of this that is longer interested to see what that version is like
Dec 28 2023,negative,very little character development  such a simple alltoocommon plot
Dec 28 2023,positive,movie was awesome good story it couldve of been a starwars movie probably better it wasnt finally something new than starwars and im a starwars fan i watched 3xs
Dec 28 2023,positive,firstly in terms of the rating i think 710 is more precise and reasonable not sure how ppl are giving it a 15 or anything around or less than that fractionally those reviews to me seem driven by some peculiar emotional mix worst movie or things of that sort i sense are written by folks that either dont watch many films had a bad day or dont know how to assess films like this  now to the movie its a hodgepodge of parts of other cinematic ip which is not a novel notion considering the director openly stated that it was pitched as a star wars spinoff cant quite tell if it feels more like star wars dune or at times a western but for sure it doesnt feel too original the dialogue is ok i was expecting morebetter however the acting is stellar the cast picks up for any slack and so it seems appropriate and relevant to identify that and take it into account with gradation its worth noting the movie has its share of puzzles it never quite places and side persons i feel it should invest more time in expanding on film is littered with a lot of interesting pictorial angles   act 2 is best imo  if youre looking for space fighting aesthetic grandeur and a decent plot this is for you  perhaps the sequel will build better on the things missed but the movie is a good watch
Dec 28 2023,negative,worst science fiction movie ever
Dec 28 2023,positive,i think this was a great starting point for a bigger universe the acting was a bit off in some areas but really wasnt too bad the visuals were amazing and i wouldnt expect anything less from this director
Dec 28 2023,positive,i enjoyed it as a scifi genre fan for over 30 years i would give it 810 but that is my take on that i dont care what those self appointed movie critics say about it i think it was really good and i am waiting for the next one
Dec 28 2023,negative,the definition of  how to make an expensive movie without a single original idea
Dec 28 2023,negative,its really just a live actionacifyversion of a bugs lifehahahaha  unfortunately it kinda floppedcharacters had no depth world building wasnt very good either wasnt even cool space looking stuffnot very much imsgination involved
Dec 28 2023,negative,an absolutely terrible movie in every way bland and predictable plot comically evil villains cardboard characters boring action with infuriating slowmo stealing everything from far better ips zach really lost it
Dec 28 2023,negative,just a continuous slow motion snooze fest
Dec 28 2023,positive,it has the combined feel of other scifi movies but in a tasteful manner that still sucks you in and leaves you wanting more
Dec 28 2023,positive,i loved this movie  it had a lot of action great storey line  it has me looking forward to the new movie    strong female lead  which i think is why people are being critical     this is not a star wars movie so do not compare it to star wars      1010 for me
Dec 28 2023,negative,one of the worst movies ive watched in 2023 everything what was bad in recent star wars times ten
Dec 28 2023,positive,i think its a great start to a new franchise
Dec 28 2023,negative,i have never experienced a film that felt so bloated while simultaneously feeling completely empty
Dec 28 2023,negative,meh as yogi berra said its like deja vu all over again while it had high production values and fine acting the plot seemed unremarkable familiar derivative  mainly of star wars even the blasters make the same beeyoobeeyoobeeyoo sound  about every 20 minutes id raise the remote to switch away  right then a kickbutt fight would erupt so id stay eventually raise the remote another fight  warcraft uses the same trick to keep players playing the main character kora sofia bouttela is believably intense athletic and can kick the horns off 8 charging rhinos the antagonist nobel ed skrein is suitably sociopathic in his role as an admiral of a too naziesque strike force from the motherworld he plans to extract one harvest from the farming world kora is on and then wipe out the population  an idea that makes no economic sense  but galvanizes kora to assemble a ragtag army of rebels  this whole heros journey has been done a billion times before you can tell where this story is going the moment you lay eyes on kora fitting into her adopted farming village like riddick into an allgirls kindergarten class the plot is like muzak where the tune is familiar but the highs and low have been taken out
Dec 28 2023,negative,mama this is garbage
Dec 28 2023,positive,sometimes cliche but visually engaging
Dec 28 2023,negative,absolutely a 40k robbery without the decency of including a plot or any character development some fun visuals absolutely vapid worldbuilding leading actress should stick to dance she cant act the script didnt help the empire of the motherworld calls its leader a king now im not sure if that was to avoid a games workshop lawsuit but either way that fact alone about sums up this joke of a movie
Dec 28 2023,positive,i absolutely loved this movie so fresh so serious im so sick of unnecessary humor bombs inserted in movies nowadays i was skeptical to watch this due to all the negatives reviews but i absolutely loved it 8510
Dec 28 2023,negative,really bad never seen something so bad
Dec 28 2023,positive,this needed to be much longer and actually give a bit of character development you build a ragtag bunch of heroes but dont give me any reason to care if they live or die   this could and should have been the universe that filled the hole disney left behind when they butchered star wars    yet i feel like half the movie or more was left on the cutting room floor    who is the lady with the swords we dont knowthey just turned up to the planet she was on and brought her along why dont know shes just part of the group now and thats a running theme of the moviestuff just happens with little to no explanation why   characters die but you dont really care because you arent given the chance to get to know them in the first place    this movie would have been best suited as a 10 hour series or at the very least a 3 hour epic    so much potential yet so disappointed
Dec 28 2023,positive,i thought this movie was a great opening to a potentially fascinating movie series although it was a bit hard to become instantly captivated i believe it would make a fantastic start point for a much bigger picture visually it was a masterpiece and character development 1010 i would say similar to star wars
Dec 28 2023,positive,a fun scifi action romp through a universe with captivating world building
Dec 28 2023,negative,wow  this stinks  the acting is just beyond terrible  the plot is so boring and predicable  the characters are all stolen from other movies ie star wars aviator marvel etc  do better hollywood
Dec 28 2023,positive,epic fun to watch waiting for part 2
Dec 28 2023,negative,this movie is an absolute mess it tries to do 20 different things at once and never does one well the story is all over the place if you watch this star wars the last jedi will feel like a masterpiece in comparison
Dec 28 2023,positive,movie was  it had the right amount of story and action for scifi i really enjoyed it and will watch it again and again visual were amazing i cant wait for part 2
Dec 28 2023,positive,ok so i have really mixed feelings around this film definitely has some similarities with star wars and other sifi films but has its own story really great effects and perfectly designed sets where it falls short is the plot and characters outside of charlies played jax from soa character they simply arent interesting the plot for recruitment of the rebel force feels rushed i think the bones of this story had promise but the lead protagonist and most of the supporting cast just arent interesting enough to pull you in im invested enough to watch the second movie but i dont have high hopes
Dec 28 2023,positive,anything that the critics on rotten tomatoes dislike tends to be worth a watch this is so much better than that trash movie that obama and his husband michael produced
Dec 28 2023,negative,1 it is supposed to be a movie show dont tell it is just so laboriously slow with an intro of seemingly endless narration    2 a good movie is more than a collection of action scenes strung together with monologues and narration    lots of interesting concepts but not put to good use plot makes very little sense  for example the evil empire is evil for the sake of being evil    evil empire hey we can sellgive you farming robots so you can have massive yields  farmers naw we want to work by hand we are just a tiny farming community on this planet and dont exactly grow much food    a semiintelligent evil empire would say okay cool then take their farming robots and farm the hell out of a different part of the planet to get the food they need maybe offering to pay for some time with their master gardener    but nope instead they kill a couple people and drop off their most sadistic troops to ensure their plan goes to hell in a hand basket right away protagonists cant be chronically stupid and yet have a track record of amazing competence    it simply isnt very good
Dec 28 2023,negative,great visual effects with some good action sequences but character development so shallow theyd drown in a puddle no real character development weak script writing which sadly lets down some great actors if it had a better script this could have been a great film
Dec 28 2023,positive,i think the stark chasm between the critics and viewers is proof critics are severely out of touch with what people love and enjoy it does not matter if it has elements from other ip so does literally everything the film is epic fun stop hating
Dec 28 2023,positive,its nothing original but i always dig a korusawa adventure
Dec 28 2023,positive,its kinda slow to get the story going big plot twist at the end but i did like the character how badass she is love the eye candy
Dec 28 2023,negative,its awful i do not recommend
Dec 28 2023,negative,ill start off by saying i do love science fiction movies but what did i just watch the movie has a weak storyline and a lot of random characters from different timelines and mythologies why it was like watching a mixture of avatar star wars harry potter the gladiator and tarzan who all join up to battle a few nazis so very disturbing  and one really bad nazi gets all his teeths knocked out in the end no wait all the teeths are back in place i next scene
Dec 28 2023,negative,flat storyline  bad accents and takes a lot of effort to stay involved it was like a low budget star wars
Dec 28 2023,negative,formulaic  embarrassingly predictable nothing original or captivating 
Dec 28 2023,positive,do not believe the critics go watch the movie for yourself it is a great movie with an interesting plot and stunning visuals
Dec 28 2023,negative,horrid story characters ok visuals
Dec 28 2023,positive,entertaining some parts feel rushed while at the same time there are too many unnecessary scenes with slow motion i believe the extended version will resolve many of the story and character development problems
Dec 28 2023,positive,this movie isnt an original but its packed with excitement and fun a digital masterpiece a decent storyline excellent acting and great special effects anthony hopkins narration set the movie up to be great right from the start its definitely worth a watch
Dec 28 2023,positive,my family and i massively enjoyed this film and look forward to part two there are  negatives including some characters receiving less memorable features and backstory than perhaps needed but i found myself along for the action packed ride in every scene certainly worth a watch
Dec 28 2023,negative,boring pathwork from past masterpieces of the genre horrible vfx
Dec 28 2023,negative,i was hyped about thisbecause of zack but its a cheap and bad star wars copy boring storyboring characters and sometimes bad effects
Dec 28 2023,negative,lacklustre storyline and too many cliches visual effects were good but not enough to hold my interest
Dec 28 2023,positive,not a great movie by any means its a sci fi rehash of seven samurai that feels very rushed the last hour or so of the film is watchable and to a point enjoyable hopefully part 2 will be better
Dec 28 2023,positive,very entertaining visually stunning and interesting story i do not understand all the online hate most people i know liked the movie good that there is a new original film instead of another prequel or sequal even if it is inspired by other movies and stories
Dec 28 2023,negative,seriously garbage  an embarrassment for the scifi genre a mash up of far better films with cheesy tropes by the score a heinously clunky script with characters shallower than a puddle that the creators are trying desperately to have us connect with using 15 second back stories if that and ott dramatic music and exposition cgi sfx overload with bad greenscreen shots and too many absurd slomos why do we need to look forward to the directors cut if he cant make a decent film in the cinematic cut
Dec 28 2023,neutral,its well not what was advertised   its a enjoyable watch ones  the movie had big ideas and drowned in rushed story plots and shallow expositions
Dec 28 2023,negative,battle beyond the stars 1980 did it better    i give this film an extra star for taraks fine oiled up abs  but next time zach a little more story and a little less pretenscious slowmo  and ffs  stop using that awful camera lens when i go to see a movie at the cinema im interested to actually see the film and not feel like im developing cateracts
Dec 28 2023,positive,great movie awesome visuals and solid adventure definitely watch it and ignore the critics
Dec 28 2023,positive,was ok not his best  but ok need to see the 4 hour version to be sure
Dec 28 2023,positive,very much dont understand all the hate and low imdb and tomato score usually when this is the case the films end up quite good which means that critics always go in with extreme high expectations not going their way and so bad score     its a fresh sci fi action adventure which is entertaining and one of those can be watched over and over again kind of films its rare these days for films to have that unique quality     very much excited about part 2 and hope zack manages to finish what he started
Dec 28 2023,negative,predictable boring and not fun  it looked like a bunch of slow motion highlight reels for a bunch of characters no one cares about or is made to care about
Dec 28 2023,negative,a film poor in ideas with an overuse of quotations and a trite plot the characters were not characterized at all
Dec 28 2023,positive,i liked it waiting for part 2  story is great cgi is not up to the mark at times but good overall writer have borrowed some ideas from other movies but they fits perfectly  critics are the rotten ones here
Dec 28 2023,negative,this movie felt a bit disconnected  you never feel that the story is unique  20 minutes in you realise you are watching a highlight real of all your favourite actionadventure moviesthe accents doesnt match the characters the costumes are all over the place  we have a nazi bad guy han solo wannabe viking farmer bravehearts brother and sister cowboy ninja with lightsabers a general gladiator who played in gladiator with a very similar back story than maximus and a hero that escaped from the script of sucker punchand the story line almost feels a bit like foundation meets star warsone more thing the nazi bad guy is resurrected the same way in which neo wakes up from the matrix
Dec 28 2023,positive,ive always liked zacks vision good movie for me
Dec 28 2023,positive,a beautiful and brilliant movie cant wait for part two
Dec 28 2023,positive,while some of the cg is quite bad i really enjoyed this movie over all yeah it borrows from many sifi creations before it but i thought it was fresh and interesting i look forward to the sequel
Dec 28 2023,positive,seven samurai for gen z not great but not bad has potential that the directors cut will fix the uneven pacing good special effects and over the top characters for what amounts to a prequel for a part 2 sets up the real story that will make our break any future sequels
Dec 28 2023,positive,i liked it and cant wait for part 2
Dec 28 2023,positive,great movie looking forward to part two
Dec 28 2023,positive,unsure how people could give this movie anything but 3 star plus personally i felt it was the best movie ive seen in a whileid describe it as a space adventure movie where you just need to sit back relax and enjoy the film i cannot wait for the sequel
Dec 28 2023,negative,think bugs life as a space opera with aliens and humans   big bad guys come to take the annual harvest   threaten to hurt everyone if they do not provide a full harvest   one of the farmers takes on the role of finding even meaner bugs people to fight the bad guys away from their farming community   sword wielding ninja mercenary named nemesis   bad han solo owns a ship   roman themes throughout  including a general or two   a displaced prince who can speak to fantastic beasts and apparently can handle the massive thermal changes without ever wearing a shirt but he needs pants   a bad guy who is killed and then restored to life with a new mission to bring back the kidnappedadopted daughter of thanos wait no but kind of      aside from the thin veil of plagiarism the special effects are pretty good the story telling is subpar i watched this because it got great reviews i see that i was maliciously misinformed
Dec 28 2023,positive,i thought it was pretty good i feel like the directors cut or 2nd will be even better with that said ill probably rewatch again soon was visually stunning and thought the story was pretty good with a lot of potential
Dec 28 2023,positive,acting is what makes or breaks a movie the storytelling is key so i can see how some review this poorly  good action and some cg that was overdone  character development seemed rushed and flowed a tad clunky  its rewatchable when the next film releases
Dec 28 2023,negative,like a much much worse version of star wars extremely cliched stuff paint by numbers scifi a cartoonish villain who is dressed like a nazi the dude with the irish accent is unintentionally hilarious because he feels so out of place after the first 20 minutes this movie was an absolute meandering slog    also the plot is ripoff of a bugs life lol
Dec 28 2023,negative,bad in a lot of way good in very few
Dec 28 2023,positive,its a familiar story with a bit of twist the movie is definitely laying the foundation and building up to what i think will be an amazing story i enjoyed it
Dec 28 2023,positive,loved the visual effects the fight scenes and the overall sci fi concept most importantly i was entertained by the movie and enjoyed it thoroughly isnt that what a movie suppose to do
Dec 28 2023,positive,awesome movie im torn between rebel moon and the creator as my favorite movie of 2023 definitely recommend watching if you havent already
Dec 28 2023,positive,way better than star wars finally an adult version of star wars
Dec 28 2023,negative,a really waste of time  a copy paste of every science fiction franchise
Dec 28 2023,positive,rebel moon is a worthy watch but dont expect to be thrilled it definitely borrowed the star wars material including the lightsaber  its tons of fun though and shouldnt be missed
Dec 28 2023,negative,visually ok truly terrible story direction and dialog no original characters or creatures  too many characters and theyre all ridiculous worse than i feared but not the absolute worst thing ive seen actors are likeable some of the action sequences are ok starts out well enough
Dec 28 2023,negative,very poor story line and script writing
Dec 28 2023,positive,amazing better ending then most things we get and it has a part 2 keep doing great work
Dec 28 2023,negative,lets start with the good great visuals and acting throughout the movie     there is a lot of bad the story is stale and becomes even worse as almost every situation has a predictable outcome you also have quite a lot of that makes no sense moments where it seems something happens to specifically move the storyline forward but also defies rationale    there was some character development but again it took a backseat in order to force the story progression this movie needed at least 30 more minutes of runtime as it didnt progress smoothly and felt extremely rushedconstrained    i probably need to rewatch it as i dozed off on it a few times which rarely happens while im watching an action movie
Dec 28 2023,positive,treat the movie for what it is an origin story to a new world great movie from the beginning to the end was able to watch in one showing cant wait for the next installment
Dec 28 2023,negative,the first thirty minutes were interesting even though none of the characters showed any emotions but after that it just dragged on while going nowhere
Dec 28 2023,negative,what did i just watch   i was really excited for this film and maybe i had too high expectations   i found it lacking
Dec 28 2023,positive,a little cliche but still a fun sci fi movie worth supporting new universes that can expand and become even greater in my opinion love the risk on a new ip worth a watch
Dec 28 2023,positive,good not great  seems like the characters were thrown together kind of fast  not a lot of meaningful interaction that made me care about any of them  im most interested in the robot who doesnt want to fight
Dec 28 2023,positive,very entertaining great visuals  this is a solid action move that is well done and sofia boutella is the ultra rare actress who plays a convincing female military character not deep or philosophical but entertaining  escapist entertainment
Dec 28 2023,negative,this is the worst movie ive ever seen its the perfect homage to the popular media of this era soulless unoriginal nonsense its genuinely astonishing how bad this movie is its worth watching just to revel in its total failure
Dec 28 2023,positive,this movie was fantastic  the world building and cinematography was on point the story did a good job of introducing us to a new world and the major charcters while laying the foundation for a larger epic story     somthing that i enjoyed in particular was the many visual and story homages this movie pays to some of the great scifis of the 90s     it was a fun ride i highly recommend
Dec 28 2023,neutral,cinematography was distracting shooting wide open for the whole movie looks terrible
Dec 28 2023,negative,where is the story  you get to the end and you dont actually care for any of the characters this movie has no heart there are moments where you almost glimpse the team their trying to build but it misses the mark
Dec 28 2023,positive,it was entertaining but it was definitely overhyped some things seemed off like the story itself the random slowmo scenes and none of the characters had any chemistry or connection that said it was visually entertaining the action scenes were fun minus the overdone and unnecessary slowmo scenes and the series has potential if its steered back on track i give it 4 stars because it was a fun watch and because we need more shows of this production quality on streaming services though i hope they can learn from their mistakes
Dec 28 2023,negative,great world building but all the character relationships felt super forced and cheesy nemesis has the most depth of all the characters and she gets 7 minutes screen time the design of the characters and the art direction is the only good part about the movie
Dec 28 2023,positive,yes its all very derivative yada yada yadabut it is entertaining some interesting characters good action sequences and for the most part delivering impressive visualslets wait and see what part ii yields in april before getting too carried away
Dec 28 2023,positive,if you like sci fi youll like this does it have flaws yes but it pulls you in in an unexplainable way
Dec 28 2023,negative,awful as a whole characters are boring and forgettable every scene was stolen from some other sci fi or fantasy great the only thing this had was great graphics but with that it also created probably the worst part of the show which is the fact that the fight scenes were ultra violent but only had pg 13 outcomes in multiple scenes arms were broken but not really broken the scenes occur in what should be very gruesome but no gore whatsoever it just didnt fit together at least in like a pg 13 marvel movie the combat matches the outcome a lot of hype for the ultimate let down
Dec 28 2023,positive,beautiful cinematography and action the story also keeps you on the edge of your seat
Dec 28 2023,negative,like most other peoples opionions this movie has great visuals but some below par characters and acting also charlie hunnams northern irish accent is just so annoying
Dec 28 2023,positive,awesome sci fi film  i loved it  really looking forward to the next part
Dec 28 2023,neutral,i had high hopes for this and its not bad per se truly beautiful action was amazing it was just too much content in too little time jumping from planet to planet person to person so quickly i couldnt remember main characters names let alone feel a compelling connection to them this would have worked far better as a 6 or even 8 part series so that each worldcharacter could have been explored more in depth such huge potential only to over pack it and miss a lot of depth i will still check out part 2 but cant get over my disappointment at imagining what could have been
Dec 28 2023,negative,the movie was very appealing visually but the lack of entertaining writing and borrowed tropes alone cant make a good movie out of a less than appealing narrative the over abundance of slow motion makes this movie incredibly boring it is predictable and cannot be carried by its amazing cast alone
Dec 28 2023,negative,i feel like this is gonna be fodder for mystery science theater 3000
Dec 28 2023,positive,this movie was one of those epic movies sure the storyline felt like it was on fast forward at times and the acting couldve been a little better but this movie satisfies the fantasy of fighting an intergalactic war that isnt too far fetched
Dec 28 2023,positive,loved this cant wait for part two  the slow burn here and there doesnt bother me  its setting up part 2
Dec 28 2023,positive,i believe the critics got this one wrong they could only credit the visuals which are epic but it creates a brand new ip were a female protagonist who has to face the demons of her past to save her future fantastic avoids the mary sue star wars narrative also doesnt get bogged down in the metadology of the force or explaining the ability of their warrior the narrative that ultimately killed star wars over explaining the force and restricting the abilities to someone who was force sensitive thankfully this new space opera creates a story of survival and resistance that is both familiar and fresh the movie has star wars avatar and the matrix inspired moments moments that shocked cinema and its definitely recaptured in rebel moon
Dec 28 2023,positive,great scifi film with the epic scale youd expect from one of snyders pieces of art the only thing missing is more of it i cant wait for the longer cut and part 2
Dec 28 2023,negative,what on the garbage did i just watch missing plot lines rushes to the ending in the longest way possible im still not sure why the protagonist and antagonist started fighting at the end its not even an original concept it could have at least been done better i made this account just to tell everyone how disappointed i am now i know how my father felt
Dec 28 2023,positive,dazzling entertaining and unexpected brilliance will need to watch again on a larger screen
Dec 28 2023,negative,if you like slowmo and terrible writing then this is the film for you
Dec 28 2023,negative,it has an ok start to it although the accents of the bad soldiers was a bit on the nose    then it turns into seven space samurai but unlike the original where you understand what theyre doing and why its a lot more ambiguous here in the original you understand what both sides want and how they plan on achieving it     in the original its a village full of people guided by the ronin in a defensible position they are against a gang of bandits this is a winnable fight    in seven go to space theyre defending a village against the equivalent of the empire in star wars the second they encounter hardship they could just destroy the village or the entire planet our heroes even seem to acknowledge this but still dont seem to have any kind of plan beyond join forces and defend the village    so after they leave the village pretty early in the movie its just a recruitment drive we go to next guy and collect for team we have no plan its shockingly boring
Dec 28 2023,neutral,ok so here we go the sets looked fake and were so damn bland the cgi was good sometimes but mostly not you could tell where the sets ended and the green screen started the plot was dumb and the practical effects were horrible and too much slowmo a very average film from an extremely overrated director
Dec 28 2023,positive,loved it in fact it had many many elements of what make a large action science fiction story work ignore the critics sure it isnt the martian but enjoy it as its a fun amazing ride cant wait for part 2 and hopefully part 3
Dec 28 2023,positive,first of all having a strong female lead without cheesiness and over the top emphasis is rare and rebel moon has managed to write a great one the characters and visuals are stunning also my only gripe is that its quite slow at points and characters havent been fully developed but that might be down to it being a two parter so ill hold my judgement until watching it
Dec 28 2023,negative,a truly terrible movie with no engaging charaters overly dramatic music some good acting by the main villain allthough his resemblance to hitler is so cliché but the rest very bad and dont even get me started on the bad irish accents it tries so so hard to be star wars but comes off as desparate thinnest of plots the fighting is so artificial and exaggerated the death of darrian blodaxe with tears in his eyes was downright silly the fight between the villain and heroine made me laugh it was so ridiculous and the speach about honouring those who gave their lives so overly dramatic ive never seen a movie taking itself so seriously and with its head so far up its own awill spare myself watching the sequel
Dec 28 2023,negative,rebel moon is a copy paste of everything without any depth in the script  dont waste your time with this movie
Dec 28 2023,negative,so confusing and no point to the movie
Dec 27 2023,positive,action packed movie with likeable characters  it had a star wars fight against the empire vibe and entertained cant wait for the sequel
Dec 27 2023,positive,solid movie definitely gonna watch the sequels no idea why people are bombing it
Dec 27 2023,negative,disappointed definitely not for children r rated
Dec 27 2023,positive,one of the most fun sci fi films ive seen in years what star wars prequels and sequels should have been
Dec 27 2023,negative,i cant believe how boring and uninspired this was there are some cool cinematic shots thats about it
Dec 27 2023,positive,great fast paced scifi special  wish the second part was released as well  acting was awesome the cgi and makeup spot on  the alt worlds and details and alt life forms were just amazing
Dec 27 2023,negative,interesting premise but the story really needed to be refined even after watching the whole thing i have no sense of the power balance or what is and is not possible in the universe
Dec 27 2023,positive,its an enjoyable movie it feels like its on fastforward but enjoyable nonetheless certainly more could be here and will be later
Dec 27 2023,positive,my wife and i sat down to watch the movie on our big 85 inch tv it is a fantastic movie to watch on a highquality television the cinematography and cgi was beautiful i loved the action and loved the seriousness of the movie a lot more than most of the cheesy and corny marvel movies of late we are now looking forward to watching the directors cut and part two  could they have spent more time building the characters maybe either way we enjoyed the movie and i may watch it again
Dec 27 2023,neutral,everything felt rushed  the movie would have been better off it was a mini series of so that all of the characters backstories could be fleshed out    i look forward to part 2
Dec 27 2023,positive,loved it the reviewers are wrong on this
Dec 27 2023,positive,movie was okay the story was not up to snuff
Dec 27 2023,positive,keep going zack we love your movies 
Dec 27 2023,negative,the film is generic boring and ridiculous on every level but entertaining at least wasted potential
Dec 27 2023,positive,this movie was absolutely stunning visuals aside i think its snyders best movie writing wise everything was connected it all made sense the slow mo wasnt just their for flare it allowed us to view the land scapes of all these new worlds and environments the tropes the choreography was immensely brilliant the music set the tone immensely well           from top to bottom it was a very good movie some things were cut yes however the book fills in the holes until the directors cut comes out
Dec 27 2023,positive,good effects with a plot made up from star warsduneguardians of the galaxy  countless other scifi movies   total lack of originality but an easy watch
Dec 27 2023,positive,i thought it was pretty fun in its current state but really wish theyd just release the final cut from the start
Dec 27 2023,negative,it is ok to be derivative as long as you can bring a compelling depth to your story and characters sadly rebel moon is paper thin tracing paper shallow and jumbled bits copied from far greater films no amount of slowmo fighting  or cg visuals can save the lackluster writing
Dec 27 2023,negative,boring simple story slowmotion sucks totally unrealistic turn of events
Dec 27 2023,negative,terrible movie copycat of everything scifi terrible lead actor no backstory no lead up really really bad writing
Dec 27 2023,negative,this movie brings the worst character development i have seen in years the story and even the acting is terrible it is a visually striking movie that should be only played when focusing on other activities
Dec 27 2023,negative,a bugs lifein space
Dec 27 2023,positive,i thought it was amazing id like to see more character development and backstory for some of the characters hopefully well see that in the directors cut looking forward to part2
Dec 27 2023,negative,typical no substance movie
Dec 27 2023,negative,i wanted to like this but weve all seen this story before the action scene didnt hit right and the characters just didnt connect with the audience in my house  i dont know how the studios let this one out like this visually some scenes just looked photoshopped and the 300 styled slowmo scenes are played out the story was also just a copy and paste  we must do better and tell better stories
Dec 27 2023,positive,nothing ground breaking but an enjoyable movie overall
Dec 27 2023,negative,a worse version of better movies how do you make seven samurai in space bad truly an impressive feat characters get an introduction when theyre recruited then get 2 lines of dialogue for the rest of the movie incredibly soulless ripoff that relies on tropes weve seen in dozens of scifi movies
Dec 27 2023,positive,great cgi good story and the beginning of a new franchise the characters are  a bit flat but lets wait for episode 2 
Dec 27 2023,negative,visuals are great however the story was very lacking  meandered about and didnt built out really any of the side characters  could not even finish watching it
Dec 27 2023,negative,worse than i could imagine honestly
Dec 27 2023,negative,completely derivative terribly executed dont waste your time
Dec 27 2023,positive,omg loved it i love scifi i love star wars and i get the inspiration but the story is not to be mistaken for a spin off or follow on it is completely original its got a more mature content and i swear to god i did not see the twist coming loved the actors chosen for characters chefs kiss perfection cant wait for part two

Dec 27 2023,positive,to start it was fun and action packed i am someone that likes to read into what could be and for a story opener i think this movie did great it started many different possible stories that can be built apon it left us with so many great possibilities such as jimmy from the mechanicas miltarium bring in more of his kind to protect innocent people or people it deems worthy i cant wait for future parts
Dec 27 2023,positive,visually beautiful and entertaining nothing particularly original here and a bit over the top but fun to watch some of the costume designs or lack thereof  pulled me out of the moment in a couple of places
Dec 27 2023,positive,a completely serviceable scifi romp nothing new but visually appealing similar to jupiter ascending watched it twice and really enjoyed it both times
Dec 27 2023,negative,visually pretty awesome the story characters and actors were very bad very little character development its hard to invest in the story when you dont care about the characters
Dec 27 2023,negative,it feels like the star was fan fiction of a 12 year this movie is devoid of originality
Dec 27 2023,negative,bad so bad there are too many characters with absolutely nothing interesting about them no motivations and half assed traumatic back stories    the plot is a mess with yawn worthy lengths of exposition the only thing holding it together    and the slo mo omg the the slo mo  unnecessary illtimed and hard to watch it happens so often and so out of place that the few times its used correctly arent impactful whatsoever its honestly cringe worthy    the visuals are trying to be something but the terrible writing and plot just undermine it entirely    also way too long to have nothing happen
Dec 27 2023,positive,i really liked the film the pacing was a bit slow the fight scenes were stellar
Dec 27 2023,positive,iif you want a fantasy scifi experiance rebel moon does an excellant job good character development well done fight scenes and fairly good story line makes it wortk seeing

Dec 27 2023,positive,i loved this movie cant wait for part 2
Dec 27 2023,positive,this film contains lots of beautiful scenes without a strong plot connection character motivation also raises some questions not great not terrible
Dec 27 2023,positive,it was highly entertaining and visually stunning as a life long scifi fan it checked off all the boxes
Dec 27 2023,positive,zacks cinematography is as brilliant and fresh as ever truly as master at work stellar introduction to a vast new world to enjoy and look forward to whats to be uncovered in the highly anticipated rated r directors cuts  part 2
Dec 27 2023,negative,pretty uninspired star wars  walmart edition i want chapter 2 like i want gout
Dec 27 2023,positive,exactly what i expected its like last star wars trilogy but without the boring dialogue worth the watch
Dec 27 2023,negative,an infinity unecessary sequence of epicness cliches completly out of context necessity or justification it really felt like someone just typed into an ai bot write an epic movie filled by epic scenes fyeah and then filmed the results
Dec 27 2023,positive,great start to a new space epic continue to improve and add to it
Dec 27 2023,negative,cant get much worse than this
Dec 27 2023,positive,this movie is really good the passionate that zack introduce to their movies is beyond our comprehension i cant wait for part 2
Dec 27 2023,negative,rebel moon made batman vs superman look good   it copied other films so much that it looked like a patchwork without any originality  a true frankenstein
Dec 27 2023,negative,fell asleep not once not twice but three times during new personal best
Dec 27 2023,positive,i thought rebel moon was well done with flashbacks to understand the characters past and helped tie in the emotions that they were going through
Dec 27 2023,negative,very boring characters and very little happens for a 2 hour movie
Dec 27 2023,positive,rebel moon is obviously influenced by seven samurai and star wars so its a bit lacking in originality but it has a compelling story and excellent visuals that make up for it  it does seem like the mix of characters are from different films sometimes and sometimes too similar  overall enjoyable
Dec 27 2023,negative,amazing visuals makeup and costumes thats honestly about it story telling is akin to someone with adhd attempting to sum up their day in a cohesive way
Dec 27 2023,negative,i was excited about a new originally scripted scifi saga and am happy that something like this got a chance to be made instead of regurgitated remakes and sequels it was just bad though poorly written unoriginal storyline bad acting boring characters terrible fight scenes i could go on the only thing good about this movie is that now i wont waste my time with part 2
Dec 27 2023,negative,set design story cinematography acting bad just plain bad i tried to enjoy it will never pass up scifi but this was just horrible from the start
Dec 27 2023,positive,its was fun and action packed
Dec 27 2023,negative,terrible movie lacking charm and rhythm
Dec 27 2023,positive,great as an adult star wars
Dec 27 2023,positive,enjoyed this movie immensely  great character development interesting story and immesive visuals  i look forward to part 2
Dec 27 2023,negative,an exiled warrior on a barren planet and niave farmer stand up to a tyrannical empire along the way they find a morally ambiguous freighter pilot at a bar to leave the planet then recruits several skilled warriors to help her stop the bad guy its a bad star warsjustice league mashup that is far far from worth anyones time  waste of a good cast
Dec 27 2023,negative,the plot is very predictable and without any plot twist sadly a lot of cliches from other movies and sagas visually excepting the presence of too many slow motions is pretty cool but i expected more without any doubt
Dec 27 2023,negative,a mishmash of magnificent 7 and other movies never got any star wars vibe   it was so good i fell asleep and my kids didnt know what to think of it  not very good at all
Dec 27 2023,positive,very good simple story with some interesting dialogues very good special effects spectacular photographs great slow motion scenes and a great protagonist
Dec 27 2023,negative,so bad the constant slo mo cuts totally killed the flow of the movie plus there was no character development and it was just boring with no heart
Dec 27 2023,positive,i dont think it deserved all the horrible reviews  it aint great but i found it entertaining and there are countless other shows that suck much much more
Dec 27 2023,positive,a test of the degree of imagination shown in a scifi film is whether it could equally have been done as a cowboy movie rebel moon pt 1 could have and the movie would have been the magnificent seven 1960 2016 19982000 as a tv series or indeed seven samurai of 1954 because the plot is err identical and i expect the plot of the second half will be identical too so if you have ever seen any of those and a spaceship taking off you dont need to see this movie ok some of the spaceship imagery is very good but i have to wonder whether anyone was actually paid for writing the script 
Dec 27 2023,positive,the movie was entertaining with solid visuals
Dec 27 2023,positive,not an original storyline but still a fun watch visuals are amazing still had me looking forward for part 2
Dec 27 2023,positive,genuinely enjoyed this film and look forward to its follow ups ignore the fussy critics shilling for disney this was originally meant to be a star wars story but its so much better than disney ever would have let it be very good stuff super enjoyable
Dec 27 2023,negative,poor if any character development unoriginal  cinematography a disaster there are so many things going against this one i am surprised it made it out of the workshop in in the first place
Dec 27 2023,negative,god it awful god its full of slow mos watch is at x2 speed
Dec 27 2023,positive,although i liked the movie story lines and special effects with a fresh take on a space opera i am looking forward to seeing what becomes of the robot in the next movie at the end of this movie i couldnt help but realize that this made me feel like i just watched a reboot of battle beyond the stars the same feeling i got from watching the rebooted dune disappointed and let down all over again i will watch the sequels with the hopeless romantic belief that they will redeem themselves
Dec 27 2023,positive,excellent i highly recommend it take advantage of your free time and go see it
Dec 27 2023,negative,a very cliché filled scifi movie  unfortunately the storytelling is very fragmented and the film has difficulty retaining its audience    you feel very annoyed by the lack of content and you feel you are missing parts of the story    the film is beautifully made but it cannot measure up to the poor narration style and the vast ocean of clichés
Dec 27 2023,positive,a slow burn to try and build a story for parts 2 and 3 the directors cut will probably be alot better
Dec 27 2023,negative,this was just truly ass
Dec 27 2023,positive,its a basic recycled plot which works literally the same plot from magnificent 7 but scifi lacks originality but thats ok its a fresh take on plots you already love visually its great but thats because zac is a goat looking forward to the sequel in april
Dec 27 2023,negative,what a hodgepodge of stolen ideas with no cohesive story arc not sure how or why this was ever made kind of fun spectacle at times but really not worth your time
Dec 27 2023,negative,as i watched rebel moon part 1 i couldnt help but feel disappointed by what unfolded on the screen the film which promised an exciting scifi adventure was marred by a series of critical flaws firstly the script was a letdown filled with clichés and lacking in meaningful character development this made it hard for me to connect with or even care about the characters and their journey additionally the pacing was painfully slow with numerous scenes dragging on without adding anything significant to the story although the visual effects were technically impressive they often felt excessive and seemed to compensate for the lack of a strong narrative the performances too left much to be desired failing to bring any real depth or nuance to the lackluster script all these elements combined made rebel moon part 1 a forgettable and rather frustrating viewing experience falling short of the captivating scifi epic it aimed to be
Dec 27 2023,negative,this is an objectively terrible movie that said it is a really fun drinking game movie get a group of family or friends and have a drink everytime you spot a scene character or storyline ripped from another movie if you know your scifi and fantasy movies you will be quite drunk by the end     i am frankly quite amazed a second instalment is imminent the acting was very poor the effects were ok some effects were terrible the characters were ridiculous and the story line wholly unoriginal as a new cast member came on screen an asian lady we took bets on whether or not she was going to be a ninja sure enough asian lady is a ninja with lightsabers     skip this movie unless you watch it is a group for some drinking fun
Dec 27 2023,positive,great combination of different scifi and fantasy movies stunning scenes and awesome actors i truly dont understand the negative reviews i even registered to this site to let you know that you should definitely give this movie a chance cant wait for part ii
Dec 27 2023,positive,really enjoyed it obviously going to get comparisons to star wars not a massive star wars fan but enjoyed the style and goresomewhat that i always thought star wars should have   i will say the main character is pretty terrible not a great cast whatsoever incredibly boring and shes genuinely just not a great actor but would have rather have her than the a cringe john boyega cutting about my screen   this film has been somewhat panned  from reading the reviews if this film had star wars attached to its title it would be clearing 4 out of 5s easily from most reviewers also people love jump on a hate train  zack synder is victim to this most of the time big man should change his name and hed be getting decent reviews   but aye if youre reading this and youre on the fence give it a bash its a good watch for sure
Dec 27 2023,negative,this was just bad all around overdone visuals with undercooked plots plural since this film shoved every trope into itself
Dec 27 2023,positive,an epic scifi journey
Dec 27 2023,negative,absolute star wars fanfic trash stupid slow mo scenes no emotion robot actors and horribly boring and borrowed plot disney should sue zack not because its basically a star wars ripoff but because it sucks so bad
Dec 27 2023,positive,well i liked it its only a part one so there are going to be disfunction and questions unanswered but considering people get all excited about a marvel movie that has zero plot lines i dont understand the hate for rebel moon i look forward to part two
Dec 27 2023,neutral,i love these types of movies but this star wars wanna be lacks time and depth into characters seems like they ran out of money and skipped over important notes from what i assume is the book i will still watch the second movie
Dec 27 2023,negative,33 minutes into movie and nothing grabs my attention boring slow cant get intimate the characters pass
Dec 27 2023,negative,thoughtless mind numbing trash it feels weird to say a movie both has way too much exposition and at the same time absolutely none the viewer is spoon fed melodramatic flashback scenes of over delivered dialogue to establish the main characters tragic trope of a back story while every other character is given a short segment of an over the top action sequence and some crumbs of dialogue only to take up arms and join the party without any meaning or reason then getting shoved off screen exit stage right    scifi fans will quickly realize that everything put on screen by the design department is something theyve seen done before from costumes that look directly ripped out of other franchises to weapons so uninspired and unoriginal your brain will be convinced they pulled them off another set     backgrounds often appear as flat wide open poorly rendered cgi spaces that serve to remind your brain that nothing on screen is real and none of this matters the special effects look like mid 2000s video game cutscenes that seem intentionally blurred to hide the mistakes    nobody will be talking about this movie a month from now and if theres any justice in the world this flop will serve as a reminder to future scifi writers and directors that if you want to start your own ip you have to be at least somewhat original
Dec 27 2023,positive,exactly the kind of movie i was looking for also well acted and visualized
Dec 27 2023,positive,another excellent work from zack beautiful movie great fight scenes  
Dec 27 2023,negative,vaguely entertaining but not good
Dec 27 2023,positive,really enjoyed this spacewesterndrama
Dec 27 2023,positive,even the best space operas are cheesy and rebel moon isnt exempt from that fact     we watched this in a group and it was very entertaining sure its a pile of tropes but that doesnt make a bad film what matters is that the parts were assembled in a way that entertains the audience and rebel moon is a success in that way
Dec 27 2023,negative,poorly written conglomerate of the magnificent seven dune star wars and any bad video game story of assembling your misfit crew of super badasses its s real stinker
Dec 27 2023,neutral,dazzling images and effects but falls short of drawing viewer in poor character building that felt extremely rushed at times movie fell short of its potential due to poor dialogue and missed opportunities for character arc building
Dec 27 2023,positive,rebel moon is a movie that follows the protagonists point of view most of its time all we know about the team is what she knows and we get to know some of her story and relate to her knowing about the universe she lives in through her sights and story the movie hints on some interesting points like origins and behaviours of some characters that arent digged in the part one but maybe they will in the extended version or in part 2 the bad guys arent dumb or miss all shots there are some misteries to be delved into as well i really enjoyed it and look forward to the extended cut of the movie thats supposed to come out before april 19th
Dec 27 2023,negative,silly over the top action flick masquerading as scifi
Dec 27 2023,positive,what startwars should be really good film worth to give a try
Dec 27 2023,positive,loved the movie its not perfect but its great fun and visually stunning
Dec 27 2023,negative,it really feels like a chatgpt poorly written parody of star wars or any generic scifi movie what a waste
Dec 27 2023,negative,poorly written and just a copy of the magnificent 7  accents and acting isnt great although visually stunning genuinely disappointed
Dec 27 2023,positive,i liked the movie cant wait for the next part
Dec 27 2023,negative,i usually really like zack snyders stuff but this sucked so bad
Dec 27 2023,negative,action looked cool but other then that everything else was horrible
Dec 27 2023,negative,honestly dreadful charlie hunnams terrible accent is only a highlight as it adds a comedy aspect to this otherwise abysmal film    character design 110 everyone is a cliche  character development 010 there isnt any  dialogue 110 reads like an angsty 14yo  plot 110 trope after trope after trope  choreography 110 clunky fight scenes  cinematography 110 nothing but cgi      one of the worst films ive sat through dialogue sounds forced and every phrase is done toughguy speech this film relies on green screens and slow motion fight scenes to make up for its lack of everything else like the cloying absent father who tries to buy your affection with expensive toys
Dec 27 2023,negative,i dont know how you rip every part of your movie from so many great pieces of media and somehow not one minute of your runtime is engaging or interesting the characters have no depth and their motivations dont make any sense the characters also weirdly never interact  the aesthetic is a cheap knock off of star wars and warhammer 40k  its an insult to your intelligence from title card to credits
Dec 27 2023,positive,good space opera looking forward to the sequel
Dec 27 2023,neutral,if you are looking for a visually good entretaining movie this is for you but if you are looking for a good story with deep meaningfull characters and their development or motivations you should look elsewere characters suddently join a rebellion because its the right thing none of the characters besides the protagonist have any background story or motivations and they feel like they are inserted in the movie for the sake of the story feels like an expensive worst copy of star wars and serenity
Dec 27 2023,positive,very entertaining visually stunning you can tell the world is rich in lore and a lot of thought went into it cgi is excellent 83m budget and by far outshines any blockbuster from recent years set up for the sequel at the end left you wanting more
Dec 27 2023,positive,not his best but i enjoyed it the camera work the story i wished it was longer to complete the story can wait for part 2    people can appreciate movies any more there is this sickness where we only see what is wrong
Dec 27 2023,positive,the movie is a welcome addition to scifi lovers
Dec 27 2023,positive,hello  well i liked the movie  it is really a warhammer 40 k meets starwars take on the 7 samurai  the cast is good the plot is good for the genre this movie does not suffer of the modern plague that is characters being used a plot device      a fair amount of people complain about characterisation but for me it is on par with the first part of the 7 samurai which is 207 minutes long in the japanese version on that front ultimately the next instalment is going to be mesure of that point they have hinted enough through each characters to  make  me quietly confident on that front  phil
Dec 27 2023,negative,star wars from wish   bad acting cgi is ok script is shocking     count how many movie rip offs you can spot its not a hard challenge either
Dec 27 2023,neutral,place 100g of star wars 25g of avatar 15g of lord of the rings in the food processor knead in slow motion very slowly even more slowly now you will have mediocre food
Dec 27 2023,positive,dont understand the bad reviews one of the best movies ive seen in a long time and in a genre where it can be hard to find originality it was a fun ride all the way through highly recommend
Dec 27 2023,negative,just boring and couldnt care less about any of the characters
Dec 27 2023,negative,everything about this movie is pompous and stupid its a waste of your time
Dec 27 2023,positive,definitely worth watching at least once looking forward to seeing part two
Dec 27 2023,positive,it was a great movie sci fi adventures  like old times with enjoyable characters some of the treacherous some of them noble with enough deepness that make me wait for the next movie  and the robots fucking robots
Dec 27 2023,positive,there is nothing new in the story line but the filmography is very good and you can see where the money has been spent  at a guess i reckon good will win over evil by just enough to perhaps have a part 3 and 4  looking forward to watching episode 2
Dec 27 2023,positive,it is visually great cant wait for part 2 love sophia boutella
Dec 27 2023,negative,the story is soliciting and acting very mediocre the lines the actors were saying were also very scripted and not how you would expect normal people to speak
Dec 27 2023,negative,the effects are great  however that is all to this movie  the story is meh with no character development and i found it to be derivative at best  it is such a shame because the universe looks like it could be really fun to explore 
Dec 27 2023,positive,i cant understand the low ratings for this movie it was great if youre a fan of scifi and action then this is a must watch
Dec 27 2023,positive,i think as part one of the series it is a good start i dont know why people think it was a waste of time yeah somethings were not upto the mark but even marvel movies have some illogical stuff and bad dialogues but people tend to ignore that i think it is a good start and a spectacular visually
Dec 27 2023,negative,i give this a half star for its visual effects budget everything else about this is so incredibly derivative that i think the only way it could be any more derivative would be if it in fact straight up copied itself i have a feeling thats exactly what the other 3 movies will do wait theres 3 more of these oh god slay me now
Dec 27 2023,positive,loved that movie and cant wait for the second part i just love the strong visual language of the director and other than light saber like weapons it disnt feel like star wars once again this is one of the examples where i clearly have the impression that critics that do it as a job are more wrong than right and that they are just unnecessary for the audience
Dec 27 2023,positive,dont believe the critics it was a couple hours of escapist scifi fun totally full of plenty of scifi tropes but who cares so are every other blockbuster think 7 samurai
Dec 27 2023,positive,dont listen to the complaints its a good movie its not perfect but it is good
Dec 27 2023,positive,a lot of fun great imagination
Dec 27 2023,negative,this is such a shameless movie waste of time
Dec 27 2023,positive,a disclaimer my general mode of watching a movie or tv show is all about my entertainment i do not fancy myself as a wannabe critic and i dont spend the majority of my viewing time critically dissecting the plot line the acting or finding a reason to punish the director for some past sin or disappointment  having set that as my viewing criteria i will say this movie entertained me there was plenty of action and the universal design pleased my science fiction sensibilities  yes the plot line had a familiarity to it but i enjoyed it just the same i had no expectations for a more provocative level of sex or violence so i had no disappointment there i will endeavor to watch part 2 when it comes out
Dec 27 2023,negative,honestly there are so many slow mo action scenes that show nothing you wonder why its slow mo in the first place  the characters are forgettable  i cant even remember the names of them half the movie is them teleporting to placesbecause of lack of transition to gather random people when we dont even know why they want then to join nothing in the movie makes any sense the characters pick the absolute dumbest options possible please hire writers the storyplotdialog all suck
Dec 27 2023,negative,rebel moon falls short of expectations showcasing a convoluted plot and disjointed storytelling the choppy dialogue and overuse of slowmotion scenes are noticeable giving the impression of an attempt to compensate for a lack of substance unfortunately these elements prevent the space saga from fully engaging its audience resulting in a film that fails to deliver a satisfying and cohesive experience
Dec 27 2023,positive,i dont know why its getting so much hate go in with no expectations and accept it for what it is  an easy popcorn flick
Dec 27 2023,negative,its like star wars meets terminator with a splash of avengers   not my favorite weve seen stuff like this didnt really offer anything fresh     the evil character we think gets killed only to be revived by a big emperor boss   i mean its star wars episode 3     just didnt do it for me but i will still check out part 2
Dec 27 2023,negative,absolute rubbish watch battle beyond the stars then relax
Dec 27 2023,positive,straight forward story with great acting and good cgi you can really see the star wars inspiration cant wait to see part 2
Dec 27 2023,positive,the movie was entertaining it is similar to other scifi movies but its story is different enough to enjoy and look forward to the next chapter
Dec 27 2023,negative,the movie felt cheaply done acting felt really disconnected and felt like a bootleg version or starwars which is cool if you dont set your expectations to high i would recommend putting your time elsewhere
Dec 27 2023,negative,its not terrible its better than watching paint dry its like a really bad parody of star wars 300 and harlock space pirate thrown together with riddick in a big tangled mess
Dec 27 2023,negative,full of plot holes awful dialogue and boring characters will not watch the second one huge waste of time
Dec 27 2023,negative,trash movie with a big budget
Dec 27 2023,positive,definitely fun film stunning environments so much potential and definitely better than what disney has given us over the past few years looking forward to part 2
Dec 27 2023,positive,better than any marveldisney product in recent years thoroughly enjoyed it
Dec 27 2023,positive,great start to a new franchise loved the introduction to this new world and really looking forward to the next chapter
Dec 27 2023,negative,awful the production quality and cgi were horrible the characters were over the top and melodramatic pretty much a waste of 2 hours grade d scifi
Dec 27 2023,positive,i really liked it a lot i loved the characters even though it has references to other but it is very good and the critics themselves instead of comparing it with starwars should make a movie to see if it is better for them
Dec 27 2023,negative,incomprehensible rubbish poor acting and woefully shot just avoid
Dec 27 2023,positive,i enjoyed this   seeing something new rather than a sequel interesting to learn about a new universe and watch the character building good mix of action and exposition no boring parts
Dec 27 2023,positive,at the very end picks up and leaves a good taste but the similarities with another sagas its way too distracting
Dec 27 2023,negative,borderline unwatchable  this is for sure a studio tax write off
Dec 27 2023,positive,sick special effects a bit slow  feels like a poor mans guardians of the galaxy had a baby with a really poor mans star wars
Dec 27 2023,positive,i think this is a solid movie i really enjoyed it dont know why zs is hated so much by the media and rotten tomatoes i enjoyed all this movies and this one is no exemption cant wait for pt 2
Dec 27 2023,neutral,it was a mishmash of ideas and cliches stakes never felt high good cinematography maybe if they made it rated r it wouldve been decent
Dec 27 2023,negative,visually this movie was a smorgasbord of awesome that was only interrupted by the absolute horror show that is its writing seriously the plot and dialogue of this film would have been better written by a fifth grader actively overdosed on adderall its sci fi for idiots turn the volume down and enjoy the landscapes and creatures by all means but if you expect to get something more out of this maybe consider not watching it
Dec 27 2023,negative,watched expecting a cool new sci fi that would leave me wanting more instead i got an indie movie with c list actors bad cgi terrible writing and kindergarten action scenes save yourself the watch
Dec 27 2023,negative,this movie can only be reviewed with a pros and cons list as the polarity of what was good and what was bad was so dramatic i feel the need to break it up     pros  the graphic design of this movie is unbelievably good whomever designed the worlds and graphically created them did one of the best jobs i have ever seen the work they did into making the worlds feel so realistic were phenomenal i was beyond impressed this maybe some of the best imagery i have ever seen in a movie ever 10 stars  the movie soundtrack has a very well balanced epic nature to it and felt very dramatic but still felt smoothly placed along the different scenes of the movie   4 stars    cons    the main female actress was not good her acting was atrocious what really ruined it for me is that it is an action movie it was abundantly obvious that she had zero athletic ability even her run looked non athletic it was weird and made it very hard to take her serious in the action scenes triple camera angles bouncing around and slow motion scenes for days to make up for her inability to do any real action choreography also this actress is like 90lbs i very much doubt shes able to do any hand to hand combat yet they kept putting her in scenes where she is   5 stars   plot armormore plot armorandwell more plot armor i am convinced that a 10 year old wrote this plot line it just does not have one real piece of developed plot it was beyond cliche there were no surprises everything was obvious and half the time the plot made no sense the collecting warriors montage was so dumbi almost turned the movie off on the gryphon scene i love gryphons but there was no need to add this part to the movie other than to attract that small portion of sub 80 iq viewers  5 stars  acting almost every major actor in the movie besides the main actress who is horrible are usually really good actorsactresses it hurt my heart to see some of my most favorite actors and actresses going through the motions as they participated in this horrendously bad movie you could feel that they just were not in it i recognize i know next to nothing about directing a movie and at this point i am 100 certain i could make a better film this is absolutely painful to watch   5 stars    conclusion  this movie is absolutely horrible what makes this movie even more terrible is the fact that the creators of the imagery and music did a beyond well done job only to have all their hard work just flushed right down the toilet with terrible writingdirecting this movie had some amazing potential and could have rocked the socks off of any viewer but the never ending plot holes the terrible acting the unrealistic and mediocre main protoganist the sidelined better actorsactresses and the cliche ending were absolutely deflating the producerswritersdirectors should be ashamed of themselves
Dec 27 2023,positive,its a good flick im not sure where all the negative comments are coming from but i started the film with an open mind and found out its good
Dec 27 2023,negative,plot is all over the place of mashed up other movie plots character development was rushed i guess the plot holes are meant to be discovered later but i really never got invested enough to care visually impressive scenes is all it gots but id be more entertained googling cool space scenes
Dec 27 2023,negative,garbage underdeveloped characters terrible acting nonsense story riddled with plot holes
Dec 27 2023,positive,the negative reviews are a little too harsh this feels like your average sci fi these days nothing too original great cinematic flair and yeah pretty average
Dec 27 2023,positive,definitely a great watchyes the story building was a little slow but theres gotta be a back story to give all the additional characters life and substancevery excited to see the second one
Dec 27 2023,positive,its better than anything marvel has put out since spiderman no way home
Dec 27 2023,negative,the awful acting and cringeworthy script could not be saved by the wonderful special effects i can usually watch any scifi happily this was a massive let down
Dec 27 2023,positive,i appreciate all the detail to the lore of the entire movie just finished it now and already want to watch it again i would have gave it 5 stars if it were rated r but other than that it was really good
Dec 27 2023,positive,dont listen to what the critics have to say see it for yourself its like some of the movies in the past couple years they raved that they were great but they just sucked so bad rebel moon is what the star wars sequels should have been instead we got stuck with rey skywalker and some how he returned in rebel moon the visual effects are awesome the script and story telling is well written and executed perfect cast that blends well overall great movie and screw the haters
Dec 27 2023,positive,this was a great popcorn movie while it would never be confused with a film it did feel like a well made video game what it lacked in dialogue and plot it made up for with great visuals a fun style and high quality production
Dec 27 2023,negative,if you enjoy ridiculous amounts of slomo one of the worst accents in movie history and a thinly veiled it to bring people together this may be the movie for you i fell asleep twice even when i just started using it as background noise
Dec 27 2023,positive,it was good im looking forward to the next one
Dec 27 2023,positive,i know a lot of people didnt like it but i found it enjoyable a lot of characters blended together the characters are not stereotypes like many others today and it is a cool new universe
Dec 27 2023,negative,give the main character some acting lessons and maybe we can give this movie 2 stars
Dec 27 2023,negative,did not live up to the hype plot was dull would not recommend
Dec 27 2023,positive,good movie very good actions scenes
Dec 27 2023,negative,brother this was booty
Dec 27 2023,negative,the first 35 minutes of the movie begins with a decent plot a group of vulnerable colonists are threatened by a military force they must give up their crops or die the characters and dialog were compelling and it seemed to be the start of a decent movie however from there the story devolved into a shamockery of the worst kind the hero assembles a group of tough guy and gal fighters painfully one at a time to save the colonists each new fighter is more simple over the top and underdeveloped than the last the script quicly becomes a total effortless joke the move stumbles incoherently from one scene to the next as it assembles a league of extrodinary goofs the final fight sequence is so hard to believe and painful to watch that i had to fast forward thru it or risk vomitting this movie is an insult to scifi fans
Dec 27 2023,neutral,if the story would move past looking for fighters for a war it might have been a bit better it passed the time not in a hurry to see part 2
Dec 27 2023,positive,dont get all the hate solid cast easy to understand what the core elements are look forward to part 2
Dec 27 2023,negative,visually appealing at times but plot is simple and the characters even simpler there is no depth to the story as each character joins the fight with little to no convincing preventing the viewer of any immersion this felt like more of a limited series than a feature film
Dec 27 2023,positive,my family and i absolutely loved this movie i personally watched it 3 times already i cannot wait for part 2 to come out zac has outdone himself with this one graphics and storyline was great
Dec 27 2023,positive,this movie was absolutely amazing a must watch snyders movie making is something of impeccable the way he captivates and captures everything is really outstanding 100000000010
Dec 27 2023,positive,this movie was a very fun watch visually stunninglots of action likable characters i cant wait for the second installment it felt like an adult starvwars i hear theres a r rated version coming soon if you ignore the critics and just watch the moviei believe you will have a good time didnt feel like a 2 hour movie to me
Dec 27 2023,negative,it was pretty to watch some parts but the cgi was horrible the storyline was not smooth at all  it seems liked a ton of backstory was just skipped over but then referenced later in the movie  i had to rewind parts of it because i thought i must have dozed off and missed important things but they just skipped them apparently  i had no idea how they got to some places and found some of the characters
Dec 27 2023,positive,the film borrows from movies like 7 samursi dirty dozen a bugs life og star wars and a little of lotr but that is not a bad thing  this movie has a lot of action and is better that disney star wars 35 starts out of 5
Dec 27 2023,negative,was like watching a cliff notes movie about a bunch of old star wars movies
Dec 27 2023,positive,its awesome yes its yet another remake of 7 samurais but i dont care i like that story and am fine that its a basis of so many other stories yes its a bit too much backstory and world building can be a bit slow i just hope part 2 carries enough momentum to make the backstories worthwhile for many future tales i thoroughly enjoyed the movie its visually stunning the characters are cool and i love this kind of sci fi and support this endeavor
Dec 27 2023,positive,decent movie but its convoluted and i hate the mains voice
Dec 27 2023,negative,slow motion for me has a brand new meaning this was a chose to watch and somehow might be snyders worst work yet and thats saying something as he beat up superman with a kitchen sink
Dec 27 2023,positive,my wife and i thought it was great lots of action and stunning visuals     cast was perfect character development a bit slim     overall well worth our time watching we are looking forward to the next part
Dec 27 2023,positive,lets forget about the low budget harry potter scene with the hippogriff everything else is very good people just need to stop to be annoying and enjoy things
Dec 27 2023,negative,insipid mess   story is thin but worse is the poor character development  all tropes and clichés   most of the visuals and scifi elements are copypasted from other films theres even a hippogriff from harry potter
Dec 27 2023,positive,so many negative ratings my friends and i absolutely loved it cant wait for future movies would be cool to watch on the big screen
Dec 27 2023,positive,decent start cant wait for part two
Dec 27 2023,positive,movie was awesome dont understand the bad reviews
Dec 27 2023,positive,awesome scify action and a great retelling of the 7 samurai
Dec 27 2023,positive,as a hater of disney star wars and the majority of marvel films i can honestly say that this film was good not a masterpiece but very good  if this was set in the star wars universe like it was created for it would be pretty epic disney missed out on this and are stuck with the trash they churn out  some decent twists and character development is swift and satisfying enough to get the story moving  some people might prefer a tv series to introduce the side characters in more depth but i would rather it be like how this film did it and make me want to find out more about them later if the film succeeds in keeping my attention    im looking forward to the sequel and at this point im invested in this project  cant believe a lot of people are bad mouthing this film i almost didnt check it out cause of it but im glad i did 
Dec 27 2023,positive,loved the movie great character development action and special effects cant wait for pert 2
Dec 27 2023,negative,me and my family watched on christmas night and half left and the other half fell asleep if it wasnt for the slow motion this movie would be like an hour and half instead of the two and half hours it is the characters and writing is so bad and has so many references to other science fiction star wars and warhammer it feels like a b movie with good visuals and the visuals are the only reason why its getting a 2 instead of a 1
Dec 27 2023,negative,wow that was just terrible nothing redeemable about this hunk of junk if i could give no stars i would
Dec 27 2023,negative,i never reviewed a movie in my life yet i compelled to do this im 40 and generally love sci fi movies having said that there is one thing i can say that is extremely positive about this film its consistently horrible for the entire 2 hours so if you are 15 minutes in and are thinking man this is garbage it probably gets better dont because it doesnt if you pay attention to the clues the film makes it very clear that its terrible and gives plenty of clues to stop watching it listen to yourself or you can spend 2 hours of your time hoping this eventually gets better until the credits start rolling and you find yourself disappointed by your optimism
Dec 27 2023,positive,im not huge into scifi but thought it was entertaining excellent fight scenes and had great visuals  i would definitely watch the next one  a lot of people are crapping on this movie because it is similar to other scifi movies  if you arent obsessed with star wars you will enjoy this movie  almost no movies in 2023 are all original ideas anymore  so try not to take things so seriously and enjoy it for what it is
Dec 27 2023,positive,its a great movie not many are coming out like this
Dec 27 2023,negative,i hope the directors cut version plugs the gaps in the storyline  the edit in this version makes episode one painful to digest
Dec 27 2023,negative,this film stands as a profound disappointment a stark contrast to the expectations set by its promising premise its plagued by a multitude of shortcomings the most glaring of which is its poorly structured plot the storyline meanders without clear direction leaving the audience bewildered and disengaged the script is another weak point filled with dialogue that feels artificial and forced further detracting from the movies potential to resonate with its viewers    in terms of performances the actors seem to struggle unable to breathe life into their onedimensional characters this lack of depth in character development results in a failure to evoke any emotional investment from the audience the interactions between characters feel stilted and unnatural exacerbating the films overall lack of cohesion    furthermore the direction of the movie is lackluster its evident that theres a missing sense of vision or creative flair which leaves the film feeling uninspired and tedious this is compounded by the subpar cinematography and special effects which are neither innovative nor particularly wellexecuted instead of enhancing the storytelling they feel like afterthoughts failing to add any real excitement or visual appeal    even the soundtrack which often serves as a redeeming feature in many films is unremarkable and forgettable in this case it neither complements the scenes nor adds any additional layers to the narrative    overall the movie is a significant letdown it fails to deliver on many fronts from storytelling and character development to technical aspects like cinematography and special effects the end result is a film that is not only unsatisfying but also forgettable lacking the elements necessary to make it a worthwhile cinematic experience
Dec 27 2023,negative,i watched rebel moon so you dont have to the plot is a mess of scenes copied and pasted from other scifi theres a noticeable lack of any character development or motivation action scenes are soso and some of the production design is nice
Dec 27 2023,positive,im a sucker for all thing scifi loved it  cant wait for book 2
Dec 27 2023,positive,stunning visuals the potential for this series is strong story was a bit lacking but was enjoyable either way i am keen for what they have to offer next in its 2nd instalment
Dec 27 2023,negative,aside from some really cool visuals here and there there just isnt any meat on the bone  way too much slow mo muted drab colors and uninteresting characters
Dec 27 2023,negative,an amazing cast and some okay cgi and thats the highlights of this movie
Dec 27 2023,negative,i made it 4 minutes plowing a field in a tank top at night really triggered me for some reason  i suppose i could have watched a few more minutes  ill never know
Dec 27 2023,positive,sure the plot has some holes but what movie doesnt  this is an absolutely fantastic movie with amazing video effects and even better audio effects sound makes 50 of a movie and this was incredible  an absolute must see and im certainly hoping this is the start of an even bigger universe
Dec 27 2023,negative,spoiler alert this is my first ever review but i feel like i had to warn people this is garbage with glitter on it it is 2 hrs of no character development like at one point this sword lady kills something and all she says is remember this could be you dead in a field chasing revenge like it is supposed to mean anything to us i dont know who you are lady it made no sense then later all of a sudden the dude you totally knew was gonna be backstabbing backstabbed but you didnt really care apparently this whole time there was some massive love happening between to characters they literally had to say it because they never showed it at that point i was low key rooting for a comet to just come out of no where and wipe out both sides that would have been the real hero
Dec 27 2023,negative,made an account specifically to give this movie an awful rating  thats how bad it was my favorite genres are scifi and fantasy so this seemed like itd be right up my alley my fiancé fell asleep which was a better use of time honestly its like the writers set out to cram this movie with as many cliches as possible the writing acting and directing were all atrocious
Dec 27 2023,positive,this is a very good movie  i am looking forward to seeing more
Dec 27 2023,positive,the visual elements are fantastic  based on this alone rebel moon is worth the price of admission however the characterization and dialogue is fairly canned throughout the story lacked a sufficient amount of exposition of the supportive characters especially tarak and general titus overall good  not great i do recommend this film and will be ready for part two when it arrives
Dec 27 2023,positive,im not even reading what the critics say because i want just my opinion out there it was a fun new sifi film that we have not had in a hot while to tired of the marvel hero trope so this was a breath of fresh air and story telling
Dec 27 2023,negative,all style and no substance with the usual over the top characters silly dialogue and over acting
Dec 27 2023,negative,thank god for fast forward
Dec 27 2023,negative,you literally copied chronicles of riddick   even some of the dialogue and narration is the same     thats just lazy writing
Dec 27 2023,positive,solid entertainment im no critic just a person who likes good movies looking forward to part 2
Dec 27 2023,positive,the film for me is good a mix of star wars i would give it from 0 to 10 i would give it about 65
Dec 27 2023,positive,i like this movie it was good
Dec 27 2023,negative,this movie had so much potential but ultimately fell flat im optimistic for the sequel because it is an interesting world to create a compelling story in and all the pieces are there it just comes down to the actual story and the development of the characters     my primary issues are koras character development being done entirely in voice over flashbacks which messed up the pacing of the movie the complete lack of characterization of everyone on the elite team they gathered and the climax taking place at an unnamed undisclosed trade depot which drastically reduced the stakes of protecting the farm planet the primary conflict was based around    the biggest positive was kai the acting was spot on the costume choice and props he had made him intriguing and i dont want to spoil anything but his twist had a good set up and payoff    i hope the sequel is better because i really believe it can be good
Dec 27 2023,negative,i want the 2hs backplease  
Dec 27 2023,positive,really good scifi movie
Dec 27 2023,positive,despite what the critics say and some reviewers this is an entertaining film and some of the best scifi genre is a while with the possible exception of the creator which i felt was a great film    i feel some are being premature and i will await the second installment for my final judgement
Dec 27 2023,positive,eye candy a good story approaching
Dec 27 2023,positive,i recently watched rebel moon  part one a child of fire with my family and we had a blast the movie is visually stunning and actionpacked with a great cast of characters i was particularly impressed by the films epic scale and the way it kept me on the edge of my seat throughout i highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for an exciting scifi adventure that the whole family can enjoy together    looking forward to part 2
Dec 27 2023,positive,if i had to summarize this movie it would be riddick meets dune meets star wars it was an okay film some nice epic scenes here and there the film could be better i would have liked to see more character development instead there was a lot of characters quickly introduced to speed the story along the villain needed more time to lead up to the part 2 i feel the film needed more of a figure head for the main villain especially with the ice scene at the end
Dec 27 2023,positive,i watched it last night and enjoyed it quite a bit considering i wouldnt say i like zacks other movies other than 300 and suckerpunch  interesting characters and ideas but i also like how i kind of got lost in the movie and forgot about a lot of reallife concerns movies like that usually end up becoming longtime favorites for me  im no critic as i don have my own youtube channel apparently thats how you qualify i enjoyed it more than overhyped oppenheimer or stupidly overhyped and quite awful barbie
Dec 27 2023,positive,way better than disneys latest star wars trilogy bit rushed but the story is there would be great to have seen what it would have looked like with disneys budget
Dec 27 2023,negative,really disappointing mashup of magnificent sevenseven samurai with everything from star wars and avatar to firefly no real script it seems just an amalgamation of other movies plotlines characters are wooden plot twists are predictable the closest thing i can compare it to is jupiter ascending or sucker punch although ill say jupiter ascending was slightly more watchable
Dec 26 2023,neutral,well its a movie i guess
Dec 26 2023,positive,at face value its an okay movie lots of celebs visually appealing good action bad side this movie is very cliché little character development overall though i was still entertained
Dec 26 2023,negative,chat gpt and midjourney have made a movie
Dec 26 2023,positive,i loved it has bits and pieces of other influences but considering what i heard about the origins of the film thats no surprise cannot wait for part two
Dec 26 2023,positive,although it felt like netflixs version of star wars it was still decent the action and character designs where incredible im pretty excited to see part 2 and see there characters develop
Dec 26 2023,negative,seems like a poor mans star warsdune ripoff its hard get past the first 30 min as its so generic the characters are one dimensional and lifeless i dont know what all the hype is about
Dec 26 2023,positive,i enjoyed it certainly comparable to star wars but with more potential
Dec 26 2023,negative,this is shite rebel moon had the potential to be great but instead its a big pile of garbage
Dec 26 2023,negative,another feminine delusional movie from hollywood when will this advertisement get off our screen by force
Dec 26 2023,positive,knowing this is a first part to help build the world helps would not have worked as a stand alone  there were some great sequences and visuals  however i was not a fan of the vfx when it came to laser fights  it looked very cheap  i also would have liked a little more blood when it came to the fights  it took away from the cool fight choreography
Dec 26 2023,negative,the definition of meh it passed the time
Dec 26 2023,negative,i really wanted to like it but this is beyond bad horrible in every sense the tech the creatures the characters are uninteresting generic flat annoying more strong female space jesus cliché bad guys no deep meaning   it is just a festival of vfx and a bunch of ideas copied from other movies all glued together without making any sense     awful af couldnt believe it can be worse than than sw the return of palpatine
Dec 26 2023,positive,amazing film role on part 2
Dec 26 2023,positive,the movie is full of action and pretty visuals it does feel like a galaxy far far away the plot is good as well the movie is well worth your views and time
Dec 26 2023,negative,all visuals zero character or plot development  so boring it was like a scifi bmovie from the 1990s with better effects who asked for this
Dec 26 2023,negative,it never really did anything i fell asleep for the first time ever watching a syfy i normally love them all but this same as all the rest story just bored me to sleep
Dec 26 2023,negative,regardless of what genre it aspire for its still less than mediocrity the unspeakably bad outcome is made up by bad character writing and poor screenwriting that makes no sense even for the most epic comic stories
Dec 26 2023,negative,ugh dont bother so much potential so little substance
Dec 26 2023,negative,this is a boring movies the characters suck and the whole thing is just horrible
Dec 26 2023,positive,decent space action film not super deep but maybe the directors cut will improve it either way its a fun watch
Dec 26 2023,negative,how did they get away with so many blatant plagiarised elements from so many different movie franchises the hippogriff from harry potter queen of the aracnos from dr who just 2 small examples and why oh why is charlie hunnam attempting a northern ireland accent with emphasis on the word attempting well acted great effects and cinematography but all the time i was distracted by remembering which other film was being ripped off in virtually each scene and lets not forget the massive overuse of slow motion
Dec 26 2023,negative,i truly had high hopes for this film and its sequel but i am sad to say i was severely underwhelmed and disappointed by this attempt at a space opera of sorts  first the visuals while elaborate and meant to be eye candy were ruined by poor decisions such as zack snyders continuous use of slow motion throughout the film all the major battlesaction packed moments were ruined by ridiculous slow motion cuts  the characters were really hard to get to know and almost there to just create an ensemble of rebels yet you barely get to know anything about them the movie was slow yet jumped quickly from location to location in an effort to fit in as much as possible in the short window of time the movie was allotted  sadly i went into this movie with zero idea of what it was about and was open to just enjoy another star wars like film and i hate to say how utterly disappointed i was  there was basically nothing redeeming about this film and unfortunately it rewatchability is basically zero  not sure how part 2 can rescue the mess caused by one
Dec 26 2023,positive,i loved it  visually stunning beginning to what i hope is several movies to come
Dec 26 2023,positive,loved it best i have seen in a long while cant wait for part 2
Dec 26 2023,negative,i tried to watch but film was repetitive of many other films  spent allot of money but nothing new
Dec 26 2023,negative,if i was going to rate the visuals i would probably give it 5 stars but the story is so bad and thats the most important part for me watching a movie character backgrounds are close to zero lack of character development and the story is very predictable
Dec 26 2023,negative,30 minutes in and the pacing went absolutely haywire plotlines went nowhere characters werent fleshed out too much unexplained nonsense
Dec 26 2023,negative,unnecessary ando too much slow motions scenes flares that can blind you very weak story  poor characters a lot of fan service worth for the fun but thats it 
Dec 26 2023,positive,a fun movie with lots of twists and turns backed by solid performances and a great story  its like serenity and star wars had a baby  enjoyed it enough to watch it again  fabulous soundtrack
Dec 26 2023,positive,loved it dont understand the poor reviews just a great action packed sci fi film
Dec 26 2023,negative,this was the first movie ever that i was looking forward to watched it on the first night it was available and shut it off half way through really bad ripoff of several overdone fantasy and scifi tropes and movies it does look good while being terrible though
Dec 26 2023,positive,a good solid movie with a good story line i liked it
Dec 26 2023,positive,i thought this was a fantastic pop corn movie feels like what cinema should be but sadly we dont get much of this anymore
Dec 26 2023,neutral,magnificent 7 meets star wars
Dec 26 2023,negative,as a lot have already said the movie is an utter mess of references not linked together by a compelling story fight choregraphy is awful characters dont know what they are doing here an utter disaster
Dec 26 2023,negative,charlie hunnam was a breath of fresh air in a movie that was super predictable and basic
Dec 26 2023,negative,plagiarism but not as good as anything it is plagiarising
Dec 26 2023,negative,poor story lack of original ideas secondhand univers borrowed characters actors have nothing to play visual makers use a huge scene and tules for nothing original to show could anybody point one new or original idea character plot all looks as ai production glued from slightly modified ideas from other shows cartoons and games soaked in bombastic music a good thing is that sometimes one have to watch a spoiled movie to be able to give a credit to a good one pity that producers would again deny the disaster to minimize loses and author be allowed to act a success definitely waist of resources that could have some better use
Dec 26 2023,negative,while watching the visually stunning images i kept asking what is this scene the story structure and various character arcs are compartmentalized with the leads standing around watching a side character fight a villain with no backstory this movies connective tissue suffers from the and then syndrome with a lot of why did that need to happen and who the fuck are these people
Dec 26 2023,negative,although visually interesting and having a few nuggets that suggest a greater potential  the film seems badly edited and most of the story is spent assembling a team of characters with little depth and really do nothing to warrant the effort to recruit them  there is no time to develop any of the characters the story feels tedious and the ending is nonsensical  if you like science fiction mostly for the eye candy and not the story it may be worth the watch
Dec 26 2023,positive,ive seen redemptive stories before but this style was a tad bit different the action the story and the characters gravitated you closer to what was happening on the screen i thought this was going to be something i could play on my phone while watching this movie but i quickly found out i was missing out on important details so i quickly put my foot down and locked in
Dec 26 2023,negative,takes derivative to a whole new level  visuals are phenomenal acting is adequate mostly  action scenes were okay character backgrounds and overall story are among the worst ive seen in quite some time    this would have been a bad scifi movie in the 70s
Dec 26 2023,positive,personally i really liked the movie  it entertained me and i loved it visually  the bad thing about the movie i felt like things were missing from the plot things happened very quickly  a very fast pace that didnt let me enjoy it better
Dec 26 2023,negative,short on plot with stunted characters yet took a while to get going but looks great and i might watch the sequel to see how it all turns out
Dec 26 2023,positive,super movie will be waiting for second part 
Dec 26 2023,negative,clearly had the funding and the idea was there how ever the script wasnt and was disappointingly predictable the combat scenes were visually nice if you can get past the fact whoever wrote it has no idea what they were doing and let not mention the dodgy techpriests or the fact here father trusted by the king is the betrayer really wasnt a surprise
Dec 26 2023,negative,mehmehand more meh was really going in looking for a good movie what i got was a syfi retelling of magnificent seven or earlier seven samurai special effects are decent but some of the mechanics are questionable character development was nothing but monologs which never captures the hart of the watcher there was at no point i really cared who lived or died even the surprise bad guy was not a surprise oh nomehwhatever i really blame very poor maybe rushed writing and overall story arc will i watch the second part probably but with a lot less expectations
Dec 26 2023,positive,not a critic just a fan who thought it was awesome
Dec 26 2023,negative,this movie was the combination of tropes from other movies in this space mashed together into an uninteresting plot driven by unrelatable and uninteresting characters in randspeak its the kind of movie roark would have made if he compromised on his principles and designed buildings with greek columns porticos and triglyphs divorcing form from function
Dec 26 2023,negative,this was a horrendous movie the first quarter was watchable but the storyline quickly falls apart after that the dialog is immature the story is akin to the nazi in a galaxy far far away  one of the best characters in the movie is killed none of the other characters carry their weight i loved army of the dead and army of thieves bit this trash was worse than batman versus superman
Dec 26 2023,negative,terrible movie so stereotypical  so awful cast a waste of time
Dec 26 2023,negative,dont waste your time  2 hours of nonsense  more slashandburn action than scifi  stale reused tropes left and right plenty of costumes that seemed taken from other movies and loooootttssssss of slo motion hey it needs to fill air time to justify its supposed 160 million price tag  nothing new to see here  i wish i could have given it a 0
Dec 26 2023,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed it i felt it was a little short even at 2hours 15minutes i could have sat watching for another hour at least    what did spoil it a little was when the admiral hit his teeth knocked out by cora prior to falling over the edge then to have them all back in when they found him on the ground and more noticably when he awakened after being regenerated
Dec 26 2023,negative,rubbish a weird mix of star wars terminator harry potter lord of the rings and who else knows what else  same old plot as ever nasty empire against sexy and smart rebels  oh and charlie hunnans accent is vomitive   i wont watch the 2nd part
Dec 26 2023,positive,is like the game warhammer 40k  a good popular movie nothing especial
Dec 26 2023,positive,i dont know where the hate is coming from but this is actually a good movie
Dec 26 2023,positive,i was actually a little lost in the plotacting was alright but the post production aspects seemed to have pieced the movie together oddly
Dec 26 2023,positive,ive waited for these world building sci fi epics my whole life now theyre here and theyre glorious
Dec 26 2023,positive,great visuals great story similar in a way to the way joseph campbell influenced star wars great sci fi
Dec 26 2023,negative,this was simply bad  cringe from scene 1
Dec 26 2023,negative,its getting one star because visually it looks great and ed skrein does what he can but the story is terrible characters are indistinguishable from each other and most of the film is a montage just rotten
Dec 26 2023,negative,slow and boring felt like a cheap star wars copy
Dec 26 2023,positive,remember its only the first part if theres something youre missing itll probably be in the second part it wont win any awards but its still an enjoyable ride   and its obvious a point that this part one would focus on the main big character kora aka artelais aka the scargiver    its a good start to something bigger it just needs time to build on it in the future cant wait for part two april 19 2024 and the extended cuts coming soon 
Dec 26 2023,negative,i thought it was boring
Dec 26 2023,positive,people keep complaining about this but honestly its just a good action scifi with some really cool fantasy elements blended in
Dec 26 2023,positive,a unique take on scifi truly captivating and intriguing
Dec 26 2023,positive,classic zac7 samurai in space with lots off slow motion not bad like so many critics seem to say
Dec 26 2023,positive,overall its a good watch looking forward to seeing the directors cut
Dec 26 2023,negative,are there any words other than worst film ever for this movie
Dec 26 2023,positive,this is a good movie i enjoyed the story  and the characters but i think the movie should to elaborate more the introduction of each character i feel the movie is short accordingly to the complexity of the story
Dec 26 2023,negative,chatgpt write me a script composed of clichés but first imagine yourself as a stupidest neural network whose database consists only of descriptions of three movies pretend you were told to envision yourself as a novice struggling scriptwriter
Dec 26 2023,negative,a movie that was 30 substance 70 vfx an ensamble reminiscent of star wars lord of the rings and dune with about half the heart     the movie has beautiful environments that werent explored with the characters being the same poor back stories and a rushed premise give a lack luster feeling leaving you with wanting more in a half satisfied way   this movie was hoping to capture hearts through visuals only to flood the screen with them the plot villains and supporting cast were all a copy paste of preexisting universes just with extra steps the movie feels like another expensive flop where unhinged coked up producers wanted to shove something down our throat with the monomer of biggest movie of the year when can we get another movie that loves us when can we get that fluttering feeling similar to that of harry bidding farewell to his son luke saving the galaxy or frodo growing old where is the sense of a long adventure coming to an end where you crave no more where our story telling appetite has been satiated     the movie was visually amazing stunning no thrilling also no but if youre looking for a movie that will make you reach the bottom of the popcorn bucket get up off your seat and get a refill mid movie this is it startle up for a modern time b movie with a larger budget than it deserved trending the flops of 2023 this movie will leave you not wanting more of it part 2 in april 2024 yeah ill leave that one in the queue for a while
Dec 26 2023,positive,the critics were a little harsh on the movie it was entertaining some similarities from previous synder work could not of been better definitely but thats what the directors cut will prove overall a great start to a franchise that definitely needs the r rated version to really showcase the movie
Dec 26 2023,positive,is a good movie cool
Dec 26 2023,positive,i liked the film its story is perfect wellconstructed characters fascinating settings a mix of science fiction and fantasy unfortunately they had time to develop the story further but they made it too long
Dec 26 2023,positive,not very original relative to the star wars dune and blade runner arcs but overall very enjoyable its better than all the remakes and social statements
Dec 26 2023,negative,i saw a lot of critics say that this film is a star wars knock off while that is true for example the introduction explaining what we are about to watch is a 100 percent star wars carbon copy rebel moon also plagiarizes other popular blockbuster franchices such as the mcu kora was taken in by the regent and raised as his own after he destroyed her entire village have we seen that before in the mcu lets remember that thanos destroyed gamoras village but sparred her and raised her as his own she then turned on him by joining the guardians similarly in rebel moon kora betrayed the regent you see two more instances of this regurgitated in the mcu loki turned on the king of asgard  captain marvel fighting against the kree
Dec 26 2023,positive,im amazed by the bad ratings for this film its entertaining original ok it borrows from other movies but what film doesnt these days its the film the star wars sequels should have been it a must see for me
Dec 26 2023,positive,i quite enjoyed it action was great world building was good i want to see more of this world many people are claiming lack of originality but dont most movies follow some classic tropes felt like a classic assemble the team and fight the big bad evil story its not breaking any new ground nor is it painfully derivative to the point of being dull it was a great time and i look forward to the directors cut and part 2   only complaint is it is a bit exposition heavy and a few of the special effects shots looked cheap
Dec 26 2023,neutral,same old formula with wooden characters
Dec 26 2023,positive,rebel moon is entertaining but it has its flaws it has some some good action and cinematography but it would have been a much better movie if it was rrated not pg13 i heard that there is a directors cut of rrated version will be released i m really excited to see that version of the movie hopefully part 2 would me much stronger and better film
Dec 26 2023,negative,is there any sci fi movie made in the last decade that this didnt rip off it felt like a combination of a music video cutting together scenes from other better films and what a bunch of kids would play at in the playground
Dec 26 2023,positive,ignore those telling you not to like this film its a fun space opra that lets the world melt away while its on  enjoy it
Dec 26 2023,negative,good job star wars not including this why was this made
Dec 26 2023,positive,wish it were longer im sure the directors cut will be phenomenal
Dec 26 2023,positive,wonderful fantasy scifi adventure well acted and engaging with great special effects and action we were very entertained
Dec 26 2023,negative,i fell asleep several times while watching the movie its that boring
Dec 26 2023,negative,pretentious and tedious
Dec 26 2023,negative,watched friday and i thought it was absolutely horrible but honestly it isnt nearly as bad as i thought on the initial run it is still pretty directly derivative of every scifi movie ever made to the point it almost feels like a satirical spoof in spots and zack doesnt seem to know how to give emotional attachment to his characters humorless and not a ton of heart that said i thought about it enough to watch it again today so there has to be some entertainment value in that so 2 stars
Dec 26 2023,positive,the story itself may not be wholly original but what is these days at least its not a remake  reboot entertaining
Dec 26 2023,negative,characters werent interesting at all given the potential to introduce space warriors with special skills they just stood on the sideline and shot lasers in slow mo acting was sub par and pg13 rating hurt the action with boring fights
Dec 26 2023,negative,between the super slow motion the lack of characterization of characters and poorly written story i was very disappointed i dont know what this movie was trying to be the muddy color palate the weird exposition dumps the blurriness i dont even remember most of the characters names or why they were along for the ride i hated this movie and i really wanted to love it when i saw the trailers im a synder fan and i loved his justice league and bvs but rebel moon wasnt good at all
Dec 26 2023,negative,a rehash of multiple other more successful scifi stories and franchises with very little original content what was delivered was not good nor interesting aside of some expensive cgi and effects watched in full as too lazy to move but regret not reaching for the remote
Dec 26 2023,negative,very very very bad trash
Dec 26 2023,positive,love it great movie interesting characters cant wait for part 2
Dec 26 2023,positive,i enjoy the film just with the was more character development we was just introduced to character after character which didnt seem like they where really needed
Dec 26 2023,positive,i loved this movie  critics have renewed my lack of faith in their opinions and i cannot wait for the second part to come out
Dec 26 2023,positive,i thought this movie was fine  not the greatest not the worst
Dec 26 2023,positive,loved it great castcharacters story line good excellent battlesfighting along with some emotional scenes cant wait for part 2
Dec 26 2023,positive,entertaining loved it
Dec 26 2023,positive,i really enjoy how it combines all of the best of various scifi and wild west movies  tons action and various characters with different stories to attach to will be a huge franchise in years to come
Dec 26 2023,negative,the 5 star ratings are probably pay to review ive seen other reviews stating bad fan fiction but thats being kind this is dog  i love scifi and have my entire life and i couldnt stand this cliche driven trash pulled from every other scifi move and series for the past 40 years the premise is dumb the guy who tames the big crow by just talking to it inane the opening scene plowing a field at night with a hand drawn plow with a huge saturn planet looming overhead is visually interesting but denies science on the scale of a flatearther    save yourself 2 12 hours and just dont i want my 2 12 hours back
Dec 26 2023,positive,lotr meets dune nice effects story is ok
Dec 26 2023,positive,brutal plot script and mish mash of scenery trying to create a cohesive story  not intellectually believeable in any way enough to take it seriously  even as a make believe fun action flick it barely functions
Dec 26 2023,positive,it wasnt perfect but it was very entertaining
Dec 26 2023,positive,thoroughly enjoyable lots of action it starts off kind of slow but picks up the pace pretty quickly great potential for one or more sequels
Dec 26 2023,negative,the over use of slow motion action was too much for me that i couldnt focus on any other aspect of this film
Dec 26 2023,positive,great action great music great special and make up effects and of course very cinematic eagerly awaiting the rrated version the movie delivers what was expected so i cant see why this isnt rated higher anyways always see for yourself
Dec 26 2023,positive,amazing and well done it
Dec 26 2023,negative,what a hot mess from space vagina to harry riding the hippogriff from dune to shelob attacking one of the seven samurai how did multiple episodes of this cringe get green lit
Dec 26 2023,positive,an awesome new universe cant wait for part two 
Dec 26 2023,negative,how many times can a studio make the mistake of announcing two parts to a film before the first part comes out will anyone ever learn from this
Dec 26 2023,negative,almost unwatchable youll pause and consider not finishing then youll continue  hoping it will somehow improve it doesnt many many better movies around right now
Dec 26 2023,negative,horrendous the story line is highly predictable but worse yet is the murderous attempt at an irish accent by charlie hunnam why why why id give this movie a complete miss
Dec 26 2023,positive,i thought it was an entertaining film it was exactly what i was expecting and would have loved to have seen this as a star wars film i can see where some of this was going is this a deep movie no but damn it was fun  this was a meant to be a popcorn film sit down and just enjoy the ride
Dec 26 2023,positive,loved it cant wait for part 2
Dec 26 2023,neutral,i was really excited about rebel moon but its a soulless hodgepodge scifi mess visuals  character designs are super creative but theres nothing to connect to theres no lore of the universe other than an opening exposition dump  the characters are just there bummer
Dec 26 2023,negative,there are to many scenes which are totally unnecessary i fast forward few times cause it definitely gets boring
Dec 26 2023,negative,very boring star wars reject do not put yourself through this  it is painfull the character appear to be clones of any other movies with no skills or purpose you do not care for them when one dies o well is the the response yes this is a modern movie god it is bad
Dec 26 2023,positive,awesome movie ignore the reviews
Dec 26 2023,negative,this film copied several other franchises made them dull and stuck them together with dollarstore duct tape i cared nothing for any of the characters who were predictable and themselves boring
Dec 26 2023,negative,pretty but badthats it
Dec 26 2023,negative,found it hard to find its feet and the constant switching of camera and scenes helped the feeling of disconnect with the characters felt like an explanation before an actual movie came out
Dec 26 2023,positive,well its not zacks best work but the references he used get me i liked and if you enjoy some star wars with no disney filter what so ever  you will liked too
Dec 26 2023,positive,great movie wait to see more
Dec 26 2023,negative,this was a terrible movie the story was abysmal the action laughable and the characters impossibly dull avoid apparently theres a longer version incoming and i do not know why anyone would want that
Dec 26 2023,positive,i must admit i am going to wait for the directors cut i tried watching it but stopped halfway because everything felt rushed and shallow their was so little character development it did not draw me into the plot line
Dec 26 2023,negative,i was hoping to like or even love rebel moon but it left a lot to be desired and i found myself bored the writing was bad the characters poorly developed and the action sequences were just a mess of slow motionfast forward special effects the were only a couple characters that had any intrigue and they were completely ignored for most of the film likely setting them up for more in the 2nd part but with how forgettable part 1 was i dont know that i even care to see more
Dec 26 2023,positive,awesome movie it kept me entertained throughout  visually stunning  interesting story that i want to see more of   the biggest issue is that you can tell a lot of the backstories for the characters are missing the directors cut should fill in the gaps     other than that its a great start to a new universe  and overall a very entertaining film
Dec 26 2023,positive,i thought it wasnt half bad i am not that tapped in to upcoming films to have been aware this was coming out and as i was watching it i did wonder if it was a star wars spin off had to google to find out it isnt i did feel like certain elements of this first part could have been better developed or not left on the cutting room floor but will wait to see either the directors cut that ive now read about andor part 2 due for release in a few months to see how it all hangs together for now though i feel it wasnt all that bad but i do see why people have a sense there are elements of it that are unoriginal or perhaps borrow from other films still i would say to folks to watch it
Dec 26 2023,negative,2 hours that i will never get back
Dec 26 2023,negative,rebel moon has great visuals and the nods to other scifi media are great but thats about it the characters were so bland and the villains so cartoonishly evil that i couldnt get sucked in despite the visuals the dialogue is like snippets cut from other scifi and fantasy stories and glued together into a barely coherent narrative
Dec 26 2023,positive,it was a fun scifi popcorn movie i really dont understand all the hate
Dec 26 2023,positive,beats disneys star wars
Dec 26 2023,positive,visually stunning including realistic cgi authentic feeling costumes beautiful sets creative animals and unique characters there was no emotion there was no attachment to characters and not one bit of humor im fine with the humor but halfway through the movie i didnt even remember the main females name this movie could have been amazing with a few tweaks you just dont care or get attached to the characters after theyre introduced and its a shame because theyre all very cool in their own right id give it a 510 if they had me attached to all the characters sped up the long speaking parts and helped you understand where certain plot holes were headed i would give it a 89 enjoyable watch just need to get us viewers more emotionally attached to main characters
Dec 26 2023,negative,shamelessly copypaste of seven samurai  by kurosawa theme gathering fears and concerns that actually came back in our century there is no new idea and the quality of the story is poor  regardless of the big budget that should give success for any trash movie
Dec 26 2023,negative,derivative soulless clumsy boring but pretty  there much that can be said for a work paying homage to an original but then theres just outright fanfiction and this is bad fanfiction  also enough with the slowmo it actually makes your action sequence choreography look worse not better
Dec 26 2023,positive,despite the critics who i believe are mostly wrong every time reviewing a scifi movie i really enjoyed rebel moon the visual effects are amazing yes probably too much slowmotion and the storyline is pretty strong making me already waiting with anticipation for part two i think anyone who really enjoys scifi should watch it and decide for themselves
Dec 26 2023,negative,this movie is a big mix of nothing it tries to be a star wars movie but it efforts not to be so it became a western then an epic movie and then a space movie situation that never happens its predictable and boring sofia boutela is angry or depressed all the time i guess she still has mummy issues  its better to watch how the grass grows
Dec 26 2023,positive,started strong got the story going than it felt rushed wasted too much time setting up the why we need heros than cheeses out on their stories and rushes them liked the different planets but they had no personality and costumes were all over than the villain is shown getting his teeth knocked out than next time we see him they rush him into a virtual messenger pod not a medical pod and his teeth are magically back idk had some strong points but felt rushed and got worst as it went on but left you wanting more still
Dec 26 2023,negative,dissapointingly awful stereotyped cliché charicatures with a screenplay so predictable and corney the jolly green giant could have written it
Dec 26 2023,negative,not a single likeable character bad plot no creativity
Dec 26 2023,negative,the story was visually beautiful to watch but it lacked soul there were absolutely no likeable characters because we didnt see any development in that area it moved so quickly that im sure it did not connect with most audiences this movie adaptation was a waste of a brilliant story
Dec 26 2023,negative,there is nothing entertaining in this movie visually its decent but nothing stunning in 2023 just a mashup of random action scenes that have no real purpose
Dec 26 2023,negative,everything in this movie feels wrong it has no depth and you can always predict whats going to happen next massive overuse of slow motion scenes just to extend the suffering of the audience
Dec 26 2023,positive,great filmgreat cinematics and i look forward to the uncut version
Dec 26 2023,negative,rebel moon  part one a child of fire is a flawed space opera with highly stylized action sequences but minus any emotional stakes
Dec 26 2023,negative,wow  what a waste of some phenomenal special effects  tired mashup scifi story with uninteresting characters
Dec 26 2023,negative,need therapy to forget this movie it looks like he created the film with bits and pieces from other films and games a scene from how to train your dragon another from gears of wars another from no mans sky theres even the fellowship of the ring this is a fan made from youtube i still cant believe it
Dec 26 2023,positive,really enjoyable movie look to see how the franchise develops
Dec 26 2023,neutral,its a nice adventure to watch a beautiful scifi world building and good casting i didnt love the narrative and think it was shallow and too simple maybe too much explanation on everything specifically on the recruiting part the audience is smart than this we can get when things are not explicit overall it doesnt deserve all this hate as a scifi film lover i think we should enjoy having people interested in making movies that imagine fantastic worlds and explore imagination it could be much better but i enjoyed watching its better when we simply seat down and watch instead of looking for reasons to criticize everything
Dec 26 2023,positive,i enjoyed it more style over substance to be honest and i probably wouldnt have seen in the cinema but it was a very beautiful popcorn flick that entertained me for the better part of the movie the plot definitely couldve been better without major overhauls but considering this is supposed to set up a triology of sequels im more than willing to cut them some slack    all in all id definitely watch the sequels however im not sure this flick has a high rewatch value still beter than most disney star wars movies rogue one being the exception
Dec 26 2023,positive,it was exciting gripping visually stunning the stage has been set theyve painted the picture of the world cant wait to see this epic story unfold in part 2
Dec 26 2023,positive,the idea is not new but well implemented unfortunately the stormtrooper syndrome also seems to be present here     i hope the characters introduced in part 1 will be developed further in the second part
Dec 26 2023,positive,good film if the critics didnt like it its a sign that the film is good
Dec 26 2023,negative,worth skipping was grossly derivative with some aspects bordering on plagiarism eg if youre going to use a sixlegged spiderwalkeresq design for your atte knockoff in your star wars reject film maybe dont copypaste the fallen walker from bungies destiny series worldbuilding and art direction felt like a mashup of other scifi universes with little to no originality one could almost be convinced they were thought up by an ai image generator finally its all brought together by a story so boring predictable and lazy that the striking vistas decent acting and well done cinematogrophy couldnt stop the yawns
Dec 26 2023,negative,simply a bad movie with pieces of scenes and ideas from different movies mix dune with star wars and a lot of slow motion in every fight and the b series movie is served
Dec 26 2023,positive,i absolutely loved this movie set in a futuristic universe yet still having a connection with past times like our own planet earth a variety of different characters with their own backstory new ideas and different twists such creative writing and such an allround good film
Dec 26 2023,negative,im sorry just too much essence of star wars and dune plus the dialogue really blows  poor choice of lead actress u can see that in the cast too mostly b grade they should have hired a better casting chief and select unknowns with talentsi really was rooting for this film but no thank you putlocker 
Dec 26 2023,neutral,to pass the time it was okey hope for the part two to be better
Dec 26 2023,positive,this is the best thing ive watched and yes i am a star wars fan but im so glad zacks idea and creativity went through feeling lucky to have witnessed a film so great and different to what were so used to these days
Dec 26 2023,negative,its counterfeit star wars boring actually its clear to me hollywood releases movies to test ideas and to test directors and actors with the view to put these together into a real blockbuster one day i really wish they would stop polluting our streaming sites with this puke
Dec 26 2023,positive,i havent see it yet but the trailer looks pretty good so i wont watch it now
Dec 26 2023,negative,too much of a mish mash of scenes borrowed from other sci fi films cobbled together with monologue the unbelievable plot is based on the notion that a technologically advanced civilisation can travel the stars but has to steal grain to survive  i wont be watching part 2
Dec 26 2023,negative,where to start badly written badly directed badly acted mostly some great art direction  graphic novel frames that are very nice to look at at  made it 13 rd in before opting out
Dec 26 2023,positive,clearly the critics live on a different planet go normal people  all the family watched the movie and all enjoyed it
Dec 26 2023,positive,a kinda spacey magnificent seven small village of farmers seeking help from a group made up of rebels soldiers  fighters to defend against a massive planetdominating force good vfx but a familiar plot a culmination of too many similar ones
Dec 26 2023,negative,borrows from lots of other grate movies and does it so poorly  visuals are the only thing that are decent
Dec 26 2023,positive,this is a great movie to start a series could be better at the end but this is really not the end therell be more to follow i hope still so many unanswered questions ans journeys to explore cant wait for the next one ofcourse critics will always think differently as they are somewhat removed to the rest of us normal people
Dec 26 2023,positive,set the bar a little low and settle in for some amazing eye candy and easy entertainment a great father and son evening
Dec 26 2023,positive,loved it true to zack s style
Dec 26 2023,negative,this film is god awful it feels like more of a fan film with a super low budget   the characters are all caricatures with cliche lines cliche intros   theres not a shred of originality or something of interest in this entire film
Dec 26 2023,negative,after watching the trailer i had high expectations but honestly the movie is a 155 its the typical film where just 30 minutes into watching you know who will betray them who will save everyone and what the outcome of the whole story will be throughout the film they make the female protagonist extremely powerful the secondary characters are almost useless and are not generally introduced to you they touch a bit on the backstory of the main character but nothing beyond that throughout the entire movie the protagonist doesnt even get a scratch no bullet hits her and she dodges every blow its like shes a god fighting because i cant explain how she manages a 1 vs 5 alone without getting hurt overall a pretty mediocre movie another one of those that tried to copy star wars but backfired i dont recommend watching it but if you want to waste 2 hours of your life go ahead
Dec 26 2023,positive,i loved the visuals and the world the story was a bit choppy at times cant wait for the directors cut
Dec 26 2023,negative,good special effects but i never cared about the characters it feels like a video made by a scifi fan mixing everything they like about other movies but without any story to tell
Dec 26 2023,negative,the only thing i found interesting in the movie was the graphics story was easy to predict nothing that could surprise you the worlds lacked any backstory as to what they are and characters lacked well character id say its alright if you want something to turn your brain off to or to fall asleep
Dec 26 2023,positive,i had an awesome time watching the movie it was fun for the family and a series of like to get more into
Dec 26 2023,positive,a bit too much exposition to fill in the narrative  gaps but its not a bad movie people want to hate deviate its not perfect but nothing is
Dec 26 2023,positive,been feeling a void since they discontinued the expanse and this filled that void amazing movie
Dec 26 2023,negative,just another kids movie
Dec 26 2023,positive,i thought this movie was tremendous and cannot understand the negative press it is getting i was on the edge of my seat the whole time it was definitely better than the last 3 star wars movies cannot wait for part 2 and hopefully 3 and then 4
Dec 26 2023,negative,couldnt get passed the first few minutes  plowing with a hat horsed really in a age of space travel
Dec 26 2023,positive,i really  enjoyed  it even with the dodgy northern irish accent  it quite  clearly  is only half a movie it visually  stunning
Dec 26 2023,positive,this is the kind of epic scifi i love
Dec 26 2023,negative,i find the script just horrendous some parts doesnt add up and i find it very onesided one example is the part where they met general titus it was very bland and the script really lacked emotion
Dec 26 2023,negative,at its best moment this movie is a cliche scifi flick that relies on copying many far better movies and its best is pretty lacking most of the movie is poorly written and poorly acted utter rubbish one of the worst movies ive seen in a long time
Dec 26 2023,negative,slow and non sensical plot
Dec 26 2023,positive,another zacs movie made in perfection score is brilliant scenes are fantastic and action is unparallel if you want to watch a serious drama then there is european movies and meryl streep this is pure action with no barriers
Dec 26 2023,positive,this is the star wars of the next generation
Dec 26 2023,positive,visually stunning a long time story
Dec 26 2023,positive,great world building i want to see it continue
Dec 26 2023,negative,lol this is what you would get if you asked chatgpt to write a space cowboy drama with all the worst tropes of game of thrones westworld and star wars
Dec 26 2023,positive,i liked the movie since u enjoy comics and scifi this one is great 
Dec 26 2023,neutral,this movie was more boring than the first 30 minutes of the boy  the heron
Dec 26 2023,negative,in a nutshell what if seven samurai was playing star wars in fireflys house while wearing a warhammer 40k outfit but with no character development       the good   visually its amazing costuming props fight choreography  lighting and cinematography are all top notch    the bad   the plot is a paint by numbers gather the team which would be fine if they gave us a reason to care about any member of said team  theres zero character development unless youd consider a few exposition heavy flashbacks for the main character development id have listed the cast among the good since from other work i know them to be talented but the script here gives them so little to work with you wouldnt know it the dialog feels stilted at the best of times and like theyre just dumping info on the audience at the worst rebel moon rushes the viewer from big action set piece to big action set piece never stopping to let us get to know a character beyond look they can do this cool fighty thing worst of all the big twist betrayal is so forced that its practically telegraphed before the character who does it even joins the group     theres supposed to be a directors cut to come later so maaaaaaaybe the character development was left on the cutting room floor but unless theyre adding another full two hours i highly doubt it
Dec 26 2023,positive,great movie awesome characters loved everything about it
Dec 26 2023,negative,rebel moon is choppy doesnt provide any back story for important characters and the story is cliche it looks good on screen but if you dont like a lot of explosions its probably not for you     is it worth watching sure if you have nothing else to do
Dec 26 2023,negative,it just dragged on story went nowhere it should have been a series with more background story visuals were good story super boring
Dec 26 2023,positive,ok so do critics even get sci fi story telling look at the difference between the critic  audience score weird  this movie is beautifully done with the visual details world  creature building all so well thought out  the ships and costume details are on point these heros collected through space are a darkly beautiful collection of humanities best plus fight scenes are cool well paced and unique and the protagonist is kick ass   just sit back and enjoy being transported to another realm  stop being so over critical
Dec 26 2023,positive,stunning visuals and great world building
Dec 26 2023,positive,fresh new take on some scifi fun characters that are easy to understand and relate to good universe building and special effects
Dec 26 2023,negative,the try to be a lot of things of another movies slow motion abused story is a mess and poor
Dec 26 2023,neutral,rebel moon is frustratingly dull and bloated film with little to no plot and character progression whatsoever has the potential to be refined by its follow up sequels
Dec 26 2023,positive,some of the acting was ehhhhhhh but overall excellent imagery and story line luv it cant wait for 2 in april 24 bummin sooooo long
Dec 26 2023,positive,its ok seen better hope part 2 is a lot better than part one which is like a kind of space magnificent 7
Dec 26 2023,positive,good beginning cant wait to see the next installment
Dec 26 2023,positive,not perfect but better than anything star wars branded for a very long time im looking forward to part two and so is my girlfriend
Dec 26 2023,positive,visually good but predictable and not enough its a cross between star wars vii and firefly
Dec 26 2023,positive,loved it the visuals were breathtaking the story is simple but the uniqueness of the characters and worlds keeps it interesting
Dec 26 2023,positive,awesome movie not sure on all the hate
Dec 26 2023,positive,fun gorgeous and dramatic a thoroughly enjoyable time
Dec 26 2023,neutral,visually stunning but was expecting so much more interested in seeing how it all ends with part ii
Dec 26 2023,positive,completely enthralled so much better than a boring marvel movie
Dec 26 2023,positive,personal i enjoyed it i dont see why people need to hate on it its nothing like the rise of skywalker or last jedi or anything on dismal plus i love sci fi films
Dec 26 2023,negative,when a movie is so comically bad that youre not sure if its intentional for comedic effect ive seen so many books like this with the prevalence of self publishing where the concept is fun but the writing drags it down by being impossibly bad i dont know what the budget for this was but if youre going to spend money making a movie why not write it well this was just one uncompelling scene after another with plot holes and contrived nonsense some farce of an assembling the crew i mean its so generic and formulaic that im writing this through the climax of the movie and missing nothing this movie is a tragedy and it really didnt have to be
Dec 26 2023,neutral,an attempt was made not enough world building to actually care about the characters or ever remember their names moves quickly but somehow finding myself wondering how much longer is this movie visually its very pretty
Dec 26 2023,positive,i was suprised how much i enjoyed this after a flood of negative reviews  very straight forward story that ended well for a part one of a series  compared to disney star wars i only rate andor and rogue 1 higher than this
Dec 26 2023,negative,im a big scififantasy fan but boy was this movie absolutely garbage     its like they tried to use a firefly type vibe to try to cross lord of the rings and star wars sprinkle in some dune and warhammer 40k and there you go the hot mess that is rebel moon part 1 they can go ahead and not bother with part 2     the gratuitous use of slow motion in action scenes and long voice overs to explain the storyline only sour an already suboptimal offering i give a lot of scifi movies the benefit of the doubt typically saying great concept poor execution but even the concept here was so convoluted and derivative that even a good execution probably wouldnt have made up for it
Dec 26 2023,negative,cool cgi and fight scenes but the movie was so stupid typical plot and direction
Dec 26 2023,positive,aside from obviously stealing tons of imagery and ip from warhammer 40k the movie was a fun watch     id recommend watching
Dec 26 2023,negative,although visually appealing the plot is weak and predictable id watch the second part just for the heck of it probably wont remember a thing in a week or two
Dec 26 2023,positive,somewhat original somewhat ripped off  i enjoyed the movie and am happy to see some new attempts at sci fi  i will watch it again and look forward to part 2
Dec 26 2023,negative,visually cool but after the first 20 mins the writing just tanks completely direct copy of the seven samurai but with zero character development dont even know who most of the people they pickup are until near the end when they are all captured everyone is stupid in this galaxy the directors cut may save it if they include some more context but this version is rubbish and actually pretty boring
Dec 26 2023,negative,excessive and unnecessary use of slow motion during fights no character development and rushing of the story predictable and lazy storytelling
Dec 26 2023,negative,its bad really bad theres no build up nothing worth caring for characters are blend and half the movie was film with heavy emphasis on slow motion and wierd effects and the cgi are horrible a total waste of time
Dec 26 2023,positive,i thought it was fun to watch even though there are some elements from other movies in the same genre it still is an interesting story to be told the main character being a victim of genocide then taken by the enemy and raised as their own is always an interesting concept it raises the question do they become brainwashed and take the enemys side or wait for their perfect moment to escape and fight back for what they did im looking forward to part two and hope that the story continues because i would love to see where it goes
Dec 26 2023,positive,i liked it its decent scifi ill give it four linn kurosawas from the capcom video game aliens vs predator out of five
Dec 26 2023,negative,what a steaming out of focus random slow motion overly stoic drab piece of sht this is
Dec 26 2023,positive,its a good movie amazing visuals action packed
Dec 26 2023,positive,more enjoyable then many reviewers let on take a chance and judge it for yourself
Dec 26 2023,negative,too many explanatory segments the pacing and dialogues are a mess and the action sequences are boring leaving only the visuals but not to the extent that they are stunning    we all know show dont tell and this streaming content is the exact opposite
Dec 26 2023,negative,horrible acting was horrible which is crazy because they were so good in other movies script was horriblethat was it horrible script visually cool but it didnt matter because both of my sons walked away from the movie so hopeful
Dec 26 2023,positive,if you can ignore the fact that they just copy pasted the random scenes from several other blockbusters  most obvious to me the mos eisley scene from star trek or the hippogriff scene from harry potter but there are multiple others    and if you just like the scenery than this movie is ok for you  theres nothing original to it  the main plot could even be stolen from a fist full of dollars 1964    but at least i wasnt bored
Dec 26 2023,negative,i sat down excited for this movie it had a lot of hype that hype fell flat i watched the entire thing though i did stop it 34 of the way through when movies especially of the action variety are at their most exciting i opted to go do some random work instead i then returned to the movie but only to see  how the train wreck ended saying it borrows a lot from other sci fi is an understatement it also borrows from fantasy as well which just makes the world building muddled at best the pacing is horrible and too much info is left out leaving you to almost have to do some absurd mad libs in your head none of the characters seem to mesh together organically either if i fully had to describe this movie to someone i would tell them that someone filmed a little kid pretending to play star wars with his toys except for none of the toys are from matching series plus all the toys arent legitimate licensed toys buy stuff youd get off wish  i will probably watch the r rated version when it drops to see if any coherency is added but i doubt it
Dec 26 2023,positive,i loved it when is part 2 and 3 coming out
Dec 26 2023,positive,it must be said that the cinematography is really marvelous some shots are really worth it and the soundtrack sometimes really hits but none of this really matters when the story is boring full of cliches and worthless although it has good and enjoyable moments
Dec 26 2023,positive,the movie has too much explaining going on that could be presented in a better way the main protagonist doesnt seem to look as strong as being portrayed movie has great action visuals and storytelling in a griddy setting hope they make a lot more of these
Dec 26 2023,positive,good movie and i would love to see more like this made  is it an academy award winner  probably not  is it entertaining and have a few surprises you dont see coming  yes  it is a good movie and worth watching
Dec 26 2023,positive,enjoyed very much   great cgi effects  looking forward to the 2nd part
Dec 26 2023,negative,this was a brutal slog to get through great visuals but the whole cast is introduced like a heist film the entire movie is just an intro to the next movie unsure how 7 people are going to fight a galactic planet killing warship dont really care to find out
Dec 26 2023,positive,loved that they havent rushed into things and are setting the things up
Dec 26 2023,positive,it was a great movie that had no lack of amazing story telling or fight scenes scenery was beautifuli loved it
Dec 26 2023,negative,couldve worked better as a series as a movie its just all over the place
Dec 26 2023,positive,taking inspiration from other genre movies is not a problem the boring and not engaging story and action are the problem this movie feels like watching combination of dull tone of hp deathly hallows part1mockingay part1 with the clumsy story and action scenes from the suicide squad 2016   good wordlbuilding and some visuals not great not terrible should have been better
Dec 25 2023,negative,i gotta tell yah i wanted to like this movie but to sum it up its a snoozer
Dec 25 2023,positive,it was a solid old school part one  great setup that begs for part two better than dune in some respects love the ambition and risk taking far too rare these days
Dec 25 2023,positive,there are many worlds mergo characters this is what star wars should have looked like and not revolved around two planets for forty years  im looking forward to the second part
Dec 25 2023,positive,in short there is something here but it is not executed well enough to really be worth your time unless you have nothing else to do story wise it is seven samurai in a 40kish setting and jam pack it with outdated troupes you get this movie is it bad no is it good no the visuals are good the action scenes are not and while some of the characters are promising the majority are lack luster and seem to be improperly cast i give it a meh
Dec 25 2023,positive,simply epic a myth made reality cant wait for part 2
Dec 25 2023,negative,just boring there is nothing you havent seen before and better even jupiter ascending was more fun
Dec 25 2023,negative,this movie is a joke if youre a 13 year old boy you might like it if you enjoy real story telling and writing you will be offended by this movie and the lack luster script big let down movie night enjoyable if youre under the influence and can get past the trash you except a lead female protagonist movie to have more substance
Dec 25 2023,negative,a lot of things simply didnt make sense
Dec 25 2023,negative,im going to have to agree with most neh sayers here over hyped junk waste of my time the slow mo in 300 was at least well positioned and followed the right places at the right times but in this movie it felt like someone threw darts at the story board in order to decide where and when the slow motion action was to happen so many stolen seens from star wars blade runner harry potter the matrix to name a few so no originality here either the only reason i gave it 15 stars is because i have a large 100 inch screen which made parts of it watchable the dialogue was very weak and getting the team together was laim if you know the famous western the magnificent seven it is the same but weaker less charisma from each character also wtf we never got to see the general fight 
Dec 25 2023,negative,zack snyders directing is that of a child playing with action figures    generic plot barebone characters just uninteresting filler to get to the action sequences  the action sequences themselves are filled with childish cool explosions and almost entirely slowmo    entire movie gathers up these legendary characters that literally do nothing say nothing have zero personality no crew dynamics or interactions all for the buildup to this final battle that doesnt even happen    even the main antagonists and their ship are built up to be this unstoppable force of destruction on paper but i swear even a gentle fart in the wind could have taken everything down    waste of 2 hours unless you really love lensflares in which case you should go watch star trek instead
Dec 25 2023,negative,visually stunning and not disappointing even if they went over the top with the slow motion scenes however the story line was anticlimactic and disappointing and frankly the similarities to star wars even just the scenes of ships should be illegal really disappointing as the fight scenes for the main character are epic but its not enough to cary the whole film
Dec 25 2023,negative,bland copy and paste of several major franchises very bad script like the writing is poor extreme use of slow mo that renders it pointless and extends the runtime needlessley  just a bad movie
Dec 25 2023,positive,despite its many many flaws overall it is still entertaining and not worse than some recent star wars movies action is decent enough and visuals are too artificial but it still is nice to look at sure its one of the most generic movies ever like its story and overall design was done by ai but the main problem is that its neither fun nor thrilling nor likable you just dont care about any of these characters
Dec 25 2023,negative,visually stunning with the depth of a toddlers picture book laughably bad
Dec 25 2023,negative,star wars meets dune messy worn plot with some good action sequences space nazis in the galactic empire worth a watch on a dreary christmas afternoon glad i didnt spend a lot of money seeing it at the theater
Dec 25 2023,negative,absolute trash a masterpiece in copying all possible scifi movies there are but ending up as a total joke after 45 mins it literally hurts to keep watching
Dec 25 2023,negative,theres no problem borrowing ideas from previous movies if you use them with some respect and originality but isnt there a law against stealing every idea from star wars and why does a drunk depressed general suddenly turns into a motivated fighter just because a girl watches him in the eye sorry but this movie is bad
Dec 25 2023,positive,visually striking with an ambitious scope but without a clear direction its inspiration is clear but makes it its own the set design  cinematography are beautiful yet parts come off as random
Dec 25 2023,positive,definitely has its issues biggest being that this is basically a long trailer for the snyder cut of this film with that said i found the world building to be great and extremely excited to see how part 2 wraps up
Dec 25 2023,positive,its well made and the history is developing just right i like that has a conclusion and still theres more to see effects and photography are quite good now days its hard to please people we need to seat and enjoy movies instead of criticizing so much every single aspect of an original creation
Dec 25 2023,negative,so very boring bad and dull   mediocre special effects waste of time and money
Dec 25 2023,positive,getting a lot of unnecessary hate fantasy and sci fi interestingly mixed a bit of a disjointed feeling but kind of lotresque in that way a little bit too much slow mo but overall some solid stuff and im intrigued for more
Dec 25 2023,positive,great movie visual effects actors acting plot superb
Dec 25 2023,negative,poor i thought they want to do something epic lol
Dec 25 2023,negative,its so bad coz the story was heavily copied from a bugs life and some reference from star wars they just dont fit well its like an ai wrote the story
Dec 25 2023,positive,its been a while since ive seen a new sci fi movie not horror that is entertaining    the filmingvisuals are well done and the story is entertaining   ive seen some critics say that the film follows familiar story lines    i dont care   worth the watch  im excited to see the directors cut and the 2d part
Dec 25 2023,negative,a mix n match of superior movies that barely make any sense the futuristic universe they paint is 2d and boring i feel like this movie was made by movie studio suits who sit around spitting buzz words at each other
Dec 25 2023,positive,this film is getting way too much hate for very little reason the only reason the film is not getting 5 stars is because it felt like alot of the film was missing and i will wager alot of plot and character development will be found in the directors cut that is r rated and longer
Dec 25 2023,positive,loved it cinematography was amazing cant wait to watch part 2 come april 24
Dec 25 2023,positive,this theatrical cut is eyecandy and a basic story with holes that i imagine will be filled in with the directors cut there is a lot going on and a sense that there is way more story to tell than were seeing with the theatrical cut still this film is entertaining and eye candy and reminds me loosely of the premise behind the 7 samurai
Dec 25 2023,negative,in a world characterized by its slow pace where time meanders like a lazy river a touch of nonsense adds whimsy to the mundane amidst the deliberate crawl of moments there exists a peculiar charm a dance with the absurd that keeps life unpredictable within this concoction of leisurely strides and whimsical detours a hidden reservoir of potential quietly waits to be tapped its a delicate balance a nuanced symphony where the unhurried tempo reveals unexpected opportunities turning the seemingly nonsensical into a canvas of untapped possibilities
Dec 25 2023,positive,not perfect but a lot to like about this movie looking forward to part 2
Dec 25 2023,negative,i want to keep it short  a lame spacefantasy story with a mix up of uninteresting charakters who fight space nazis in front of green screens
Dec 25 2023,positive,overall great popcorn flix dont really understand the hate that its getting at the moment the scifi community should always back new ip when its released
Dec 25 2023,negative,the writing is so subpar that no amount of acting or effects can save this desperate drawn out movie version of eating porridge three meals a day
Dec 25 2023,positive,i really liked it a bunch of badasses rallied to fight an empire much better than what disney has done recently with its star wars movies
Dec 25 2023,positive,bloomin fantastic  a true return to the kind of epic space fantasy that we all crave  the only slight let down was in costumes being a little too current earth other than that the movie is extremely well paced the characters are well understood by simple introduction people like to criticise the use of tropes but good storytelling relies upon character archetypes  you know who these people are and why theyre doing what theyre doing and thats a good thing
Dec 25 2023,negative,the only way to force hollywood to make better films is by not watching garbage like this
Dec 25 2023,negative,one of the worst things ive seen in a while
Dec 25 2023,positive,better then new star wars 
Dec 25 2023,negative,a very cliche story that you probably already saw in movies from the star wars universe and other scifi franchises same characters and similar weaponrytech if you merge dune with star wars sequels youll likely get rebel moon good scenarios and visual effects but they dont overcome the overall lazy writing and not so creative universe and it has slow motion action scenes like why
Dec 25 2023,negative,i recently signed up for rotten tomatoes solely to give this terrible movie a onestar rating in the hopes of dissuading others from watching it
Dec 25 2023,negative,worst movie ever i lost 2 hours of my life if i had a lot of money i would have break the tv
Dec 25 2023,positive,yeah ok so it may not break new ground as a sci fi epic with new ideas or creations but ultimately it pays tribute to all that came before with elements of star wars dune the matrix mixed with snyders signature style of 300 and army of the dead
Dec 25 2023,positive,this movie was awesome
Dec 25 2023,positive,the movie was great i am looking forward to the directors cut so we get a deeper and darker delve into the characters i wish the oversight for releasing a movie didnt have to cut it down give these directors final choice and release the movie with their edit i am tired of seeing paid critics bash the way they do because some people wont succumb to the disnification of all content looking forward to the second part but more importantly that directors cut as well
Dec 25 2023,positive,a must see indeed loved this a phenomenal one    this is why i dont trust critics or what they say about movies anymore plus either these low rating haters didnt see this film or they just chose to let critics speak for them     i mean both critics and low rating haters got this one wrong good thing they dont speak for me at all and i have my own brain and my own eyes my own conscience     this was an inspirational impactful dark and adventurous story told and i guess expectations were too high when comes to them the slowmo in some moments makes this film even cooler it makes a film mean something    honestly though these lowlives have a problem with the slow motion in this film but they had no problem with slow motion being in the matrix films did they     again this is a phenomenal film i was entertained and inspired by it for countless reasons and id see this again as i wait for part 2  lets go 
Dec 25 2023,positive,like watching a good anime its not for the now too common zealous over thinking and over analysing critics among you but its a good watch
Dec 25 2023,neutral,its not as bad as critics say but sadly its not as good as hardcore fans want to believe and trust me i am a fan of his looks stunning at times great potential and some characters that stand out sadly too much going on too much non needed materials and fight scenes that are weak passed the time but sadly i cant defend this one
Dec 25 2023,negative,so so so bad  nothing about it was any good terrible plot acting characterization script editing no depth no originality no coherency just ichs  the only thing this movie had going for it was its budget and it squandered it  was truly hard to get through the 2h runtime
Dec 25 2023,negative,two words  space nazis
Dec 25 2023,positive,loved it well acted
Dec 25 2023,positive,visually stunning the story is nothing new but its worth a watch
Dec 25 2023,negative,unoriginal poorly paced poorly written and filled with cheesy dialogue and characters so much potential wasted on such horrible directing and writing beautiful movie but nothing else is redeemable
Dec 25 2023,negative,would have been better as a mini series or episodic series rushed and did not feel any connection to the characters 
Dec 25 2023,positive,it was a fun watch even better what marvels release today
Dec 25 2023,positive,as a stand alone movie in itself thoroughly enjoyed it sci fi effects a bit rough but who knowsmaybe truer to future reality smokey old ships if you want to be entertained for a few hours just watch if you are expecting a franchise rehash or not as good as  then perhaps you should think about comparing frankenstien with dracula looking forward to the next part
Dec 25 2023,negative,poor dialoge empty characters too much slo mo boring plot okayish cgi and world building  when i saw the trailer i anticipated so much its trash
Dec 25 2023,positive,loved rebel moon from start to finish of part one classic storytelling with good vs evil underdog vs giant totally absorbed in the universe of rebel moon highly recommend for fun escapism 
Dec 25 2023,positive,excellent movie borrows from other movies but then the magnificent seven was an adaptation of an akira kurosawa movie the seven samourai rebel moon adds a complete original spin to it more movies like this please
Dec 25 2023,positive,a lot better than the latest marveldcstar wars movies cant wait for part 2
Dec 25 2023,negative,are we ever going to stop with the exhausted  girl boss tropes only in these stupid movies can a 120 pound person single handedly beat up 3 250 pound opponents because she is a strong female character    zach stop being silly and lazy
Dec 25 2023,positive,i thought it was great critics are definitely wrong on this one they dont like synder and it shows cant wait for part 2 and the extended version
Dec 25 2023,positive,really enjoyed this
Dec 25 2023,negative,it wasnt as bad as the army of the dead     it was flawed and could have been a lot better it is better to watch this movie as something in the background
Dec 25 2023,positive,visually stunning great creaturesraces and of course visualeffects not sure what others are complainingexpecting from the movie it was a perfect popcorn action movie for a setup for parttwo or any subsequent sequels or prequels will very likely be watching it again when the parttwo comes out in april
Dec 25 2023,positive,great movie with amazing visuals the casting is perfect seemed a bit rushed at times and more character development would have been better but i expect that will come with the directors cut overall loved it and cant wait for part 2
Dec 25 2023,negative,style over substance bad cliché story no real character development was hard work to finish
Dec 25 2023,positive,not as bad as people paint it out to be but could have been much better not of fan of the main character actor 
Dec 25 2023,positive,these socalled critics really missed the mark again    i enjoyed the characters  the story  the cinematography   action were excellent my only complaint is that i was left wanting more  would have been extremely happy if the film and the storyline continued for an additional 2 hours
Dec 25 2023,positive,weve always known that kurusawa inspired along many others dune and star wars now we add rebel moon to that list throw in a little harry potter this will be obvious when you watch add some vikings level action this movie will not change your life or define the meaning of same its pure fun sit back enjoy its a blast i loved it
Dec 25 2023,negative,i feel a bit guilty as i switched the movie off after 110 mins but then i watched an episode of the critical drinker about that same movie in which he recommends not to watch it as it is apparently terrible throughout and now i feel vindicated thanks drinker
Dec 25 2023,negative,had potential for about 10 minutes but sadly loses momentum likely due to a crumbling plot poor writing and the heroines character lacks charm
Dec 25 2023,negative,its like someone copy pasted a bunch of other movies youve seen 100 times into this but got the order wrong in spots
Dec 25 2023,negative,starts out with a halfway decent setup and then devolves into a ridiculous mess the pacing is terrible and theres zero story to these characters dialogue is also laughably bad at times everything in this movie has been done better before no reason for anyone to sit through this movie 
Dec 25 2023,positive,melhor do que star wars
Dec 25 2023,positive,enjoyable for the very obvious and appreciated seven samurai in space retelling doona bae as nemesis and anthony hopkins as the voice of jimmy are the best characters hoping the longer cut and part 2 give us more time with their backstories its popcorn space war on every level and if your intention is to hatewatch a movie because of the director and his signature style what a sad way to spend 2 hours
Dec 25 2023,negative,bad acting bad cgi and terrible action scenes no feelings towards characters in the moviewatch only if have time to waste
Dec 25 2023,positive,entertaining popcorn space opera excellent visuals actionpure funlooking forward to part 2
Dec 25 2023,positive,this is what i wouldve expected of a movie the first in its series its gotta set the stage and give you the background for whats to come as an isolated movie it wouldnt be all that great however if you watch it for what it is with an open mind knowing its only the beginning its pretty good would recommend
Dec 25 2023,positive,i was shocked by the lower ratings rebel moon is receiving its one of my favorite scifi movies to come out in the last few years fresh entertaining exciting and looking forward to more to come
Dec 25 2023,negative,bad script bad acting bad sfx bad b movie
Dec 25 2023,positive,zack snaider makes a fantastic film visually and with a very entertaining story what you are looking for to have fun on a weekend from now on i hope to see the second part
Dec 25 2023,negative,the first 15 mins was pretty good even though most of the dialogue was pretty poor the best character was a robot who would never be seen again after the first planet then the movie falls off a cliff and is basically the protagonist meets someone someone does a thing and then someone joins the crew and becomes a glorified background actor for the rest of the movie rinse and repeat 45 more times theres no character development characters arent characters theyre just an excuse for a scene but what did i expect when you have characters with names like nemesis and blood axe i had to google that because they were so forgettable
Dec 25 2023,positive,ill take this over 95 of the hollywood blockbusters sure the story isnt original and its pacing is strange but its action sequences are incredibly well shot and choreographed im looking forward to the extended cut as well as the sequels
Dec 25 2023,positive,its ok not amazing the graphics are really good its a gorgeous looking film but the story is lacking
Dec 25 2023,positive,if i was 7 and this was the the first sf movie i have ever seen in my life it would be so frikkin awesome but im not so
Dec 25 2023,negative,over acted dull uninteresting good visuals
Dec 25 2023,negative,this movie isnt simply derivative it couldnt exist without other movies being written first the writers would have nowhere to get their material from     if you watch this movie with the thought in your head where was this scene filmed better youll have a better understanding of this film and its story than listening to its dialog
Dec 25 2023,negative,this was not good such a bad decision to release a bad version if theres a better one why would i bother watching another version of this when it was such a slog to get through this one
Dec 25 2023,positive,stars wars for us that dont like star wars  amazing hope this universe gets more content and substance as for character development sure theres a lot of them to establish but since this is basically the magnificent seven in space and those guys didnt get a lot of development in 120 min just enjoy the ride
Dec 25 2023,positive,this movie is fun  its entertaining and the fx are second to none  dont listen to the reviews watch it if you want to watch it  whats the worst that happens you dont like it and you move on  omg ill never get that time back who cares  its a movie just enjoy it and if you dont then nbd
Dec 25 2023,negative,awful acting awful dialogue awful movie 166 million on this rot is the funniest thing since idiana jones and the dial of dysenteryjust stop it
Dec 25 2023,positive,i was thoroughly entertained and visually it was stunning i think it just struggled a bit from pacing
Dec 25 2023,positive,loved the lore the visuals the characters its heavily inspired by star wars and samurai 7 cant wait for part 2
Dec 25 2023,positive,great visuals interesting world sets up the characters well for a next episode
Dec 25 2023,negative,rebel moon part one is cinematographically stunning but narratively bereft you are introduced to an arguably bloated ensemble of characters for whom you feel next to nothing because none of their stories are explored properly and to make matters worse nearly every scrap of backstory that is successfully purveyed to the viewer is delivered through a series of dreary monologues the nail in the coffin for rebel moon is the story itself which is not so much a story as it is a series of hastily gluedtogether scifi tropes from other far more competent films in the genre all in all it is a beautiful and bland appetizer for the remaining installments and i am not confident many will be interested in the next course
Dec 25 2023,negative,so much slomo lack of character development plot is rushed rips off so many concepts i was hopeful the first 15 minutes
Dec 25 2023,positive,dont listen to the so called professional critics   i loved this movie and cant wait to see how it all ends  wished i could have seen this on the big screen   you want a big epic scifi movie zack gave you one
Dec 25 2023,neutral,the good    1  the story moved along at a good pace   i never found myself reaching for my phone   2  the visuals and editing were topnotch   3  action sequences were welldone   4  sofia boutella kora is nice to look at and  turns in a fine performance    the bad    1  very derivative   not an original idea in the whole movie  from the overall plot to each scene    2  the dialogue is bad  really really bad at times      3  outside of kora most of the characters are 1dimensional         admiral atticus noble is an embarrassing cliched villian     overall a bubblegum movie that doesnt require any thinking and goes well with alcohol
Dec 25 2023,positive,so after watching rebel moon  i have to say    special effects  meh  story  cut and paste from other better films star wars dune john carter etc  acting  meh    at over 2 hours long its about 30mins too long    sure  its worth watchingjust dont expect anything original
Dec 25 2023,positive,enjoyed it for what it was a space sci fi
Dec 25 2023,negative,i was really looking forward watching rebel moon yet it was a waste of time despite the good visual effects cgi and the 40k vibes this movie story sucks  character development could be done better by  a 5th grader
Dec 25 2023,neutral,i want this film to succeed but sadly the writing chops are just not there im hoping that like with many zs films the extra hour for the extended cut will add some much needed depth to character and plot because its hard to care about anything in this version ray fisher deserves a callout for his stellar moments id watch a whole film about that guy
Dec 25 2023,positive,i think it was very enjoyable and looking forward to part 2 not sure what the critics are smoking
Dec 25 2023,positive,i like this movie very much its entertaining thats enough to me
Dec 25 2023,negative,marriage of magnificent seven and star wars watch them separately much better
Dec 25 2023,positive,the movie was watchable
Dec 25 2023,negative,visuals ok i wish this was a silent movie dialog is so bad i wonder how these actors were ok to be part after reading the script money had to be real good
Dec 25 2023,negative,basically a super cut of every popular scifi move mashed together with no character design and too much slomo tacky and chiche once again zach needs to stop making movies hes past it
Dec 25 2023,negative,that was a big ol oof a feature length prologue designed for audiences to engage with its characters their situation the world etc but it all felt just so meh a bunch of contrived storyboard panels mashed together with what feels like no coherent plan or substance an ocean 11 style gettingtheteamtogether spread across 2 hours and each of the players involved dont offer anything unique and to be honest if their names were not being mentioned over and over again i wouldnt remember who any of them were even kora all in all its a shame because i was looking forward to a new ip even it was from synder someone who hasnt created anything really outstanding since dawn of the dead imo sorry snydercult
Dec 25 2023,negative,i honestly do not get how movies this bad keep getting made the special effects are great everything else is terrible
Dec 25 2023,positive,i really really liked this intentionally watched it before reading reviews obviously there are recognisable themes in the story a journey an overarching peril a moppet a traitor a disgraced but genius general a brooding female heroine etc etc  and yet it is a swashbuckling exciting epic the cast is broad diverse and visually stunning  there is chemistry between the leads  the heroes and the villains are credible  and the core peril an empire devouring itself is a worthy platform i would give it 55 but we still need part 2
Dec 25 2023,positive,i liked this movie some of the pacing was off but overall a very well done movie it was enjoyable with some great characters and i cant wait for part two
Dec 25 2023,neutral,the film looks pretty but it lacks depth to the characters the pacing was way to fast for you to really be invested in anything or anyone in the plot other than the main character i honestly felt like i was watching a dozen other movies that ive already watched while sitting through this star wars check seven samurai  check throw in an m night shyamalon twist that everyone could see coming from a mile away and you end up with a really mediocre movie
Dec 25 2023,positive,poniendo todo en su contexto real es decir que es la mitad de la primera pelicula de una nueva ip pensada para ser seis peliculas novelas graficas corto de animación etc la mayoria de las criticas negativas que está recibiendo que absolutamente vacias de contenido y carentes de sentido  pare que alguien tiene mucho miedo de que esta nueva ip pueda hacer sombra a las suyas  la película es de factura impecable y te deja con ganas de más mucho más      putting everything in its real context that is it is half of the first film of a new ip intended to be six films graphic novels animated shorts etc most of the negative reviews it is receiving are absolutely empty of content and meaningless  it seems that someone is very afraid that this new ip could overshadow theirs  the film is impeccably made and leaves you wanting more much more
Dec 25 2023,negative,nice visuals but story and characters are so shallow one of this watch and forget
Dec 25 2023,positive,amazing vfx and characters an excellent part 1
Dec 25 2023,negative,please dont waste your time with this movie its 2 hours you wont ever get back bad acting is bad narrative has so many holes and you are just left confused and frustrated by the end
Dec 25 2023,negative,not really sure what this was most is a copy of something we have seen again and again but mostly in blurry slow motion
Dec 25 2023,positive,you wouldnt know a good movie if it bites you in the ass  great movie to kill 2hrs
Dec 25 2023,positive,while an r rated longer cut will be much appreciated rebel moon is still lots of fun visually stunning and epic it is everything we need in todays blockbuster market oversaturated with 300 million dollar superhero movies
Dec 25 2023,negative,a desperate attempt to recreate akira kurosawas 7 samurai set in space but with heavily over dramatic attempts in creating tension decent cgi cant make up for the atrocious script and the huge plot hole of a system fairing army not completely decimating a pacifist village and a few mercenaries
Dec 25 2023,negative,had to stop after few minutes story was dull and cringy characters flat and quite pointless
Dec 25 2023,negative,it was meh very cliched and seemed to take inspiration from every scifi movie ever made i have no idea who the characters are and by the end i didnt really care felt like i was watching a tv series cobbled together into a movie if you dont watch it you wont miss anything
Dec 25 2023,positive,enjoying this slice of mindless fun but forget star wars  this is a scifi remake of the magnificent seven with many parallel scenes and references
Dec 25 2023,positive,i cannot say enough good things about this movie kora was amazing she is a natural hero and fighting to get back all of her humanity back the romance was not forced its subtle and has the potential to blossom i want to know more about prince tarak i wonder what happened to aris they should have spinoff series exploring all the other characters im gonna watch it again tomorrow i wanna see the directors cut and scargiver part 2 really bad glad i dont  have to wait long i had to see this movie before aquaman definitely rebel moon is better than aquaman the lost kingdom i like both but rebel moon stands out
Dec 25 2023,negative,i just couldnt pay attention the dialogue was cringe and cgi looked weird at some point but the idea of the movie is good and hope the part 2 is better
Dec 25 2023,negative,ive seen a lot of expensive bad movies but this one takes the cake every aspect of the movie is just bad if you are too curious just watch for a few minutes and if you start to see how bad it is stop watching cause its not gonna get better
Dec 25 2023,negative,as always zacks ability to create visually immersive scenery is top notch however i firmly believe he should completely stop writing and directing as his vision is always disjointed and discombobulated enough please
Dec 25 2023,positive,loved it a great segway into the next movie these critics need to pull their heads out of their butts
Dec 25 2023,negative,hacendado star wars  poor story and no interesting at all
Dec 25 2023,positive,this could be the start of a whole new franchise its a strong start cant wait for more in april
Dec 25 2023,positive,personally i believe this movie to be a great scifi action movie although many see a substantial amount of problem with the movie lets discuss first off the intro to this movie is slow and the grabbing of sand to smell is off putting to put the least not a great start although many of the fight scenes are amazingly choreographed and the visual effects make a spectacle of a movie this is not enough to carry a movie alone the story telling is a tough subject many thematic choices and the fact this is a two part story limit the first film to as set up for the second meeting characters historys  so on which i didnt see as much a problem biggest concern being the lack of use of many of these characters in the unexpected final fight scene i wanted to see the farmer fight in the fields and the robot was barely in the film although i chalk most of this up as movie prep for the second film overall i genuinely enjoyed this film and would recommend when the second releases its half a story and im treating it as such its like stopping a movie half way through its unsatisfying ultimately im excited for the rest
Dec 25 2023,negative,this movie was a jumble of several trailers for other movies id definitely see but all completely disconnected from each other
Dec 25 2023,negative,there could be a good movie in here if zack had handed over character development to a decent director rather than just info dumps every five minutes there is no character development and barely any character interaction which makes them hollow merely vessels to get from one pointless set piece to another i mean what was the point of the bird scene or the spider entity scene its just action for the sake action
Dec 25 2023,positive,so glad the critics are getting slammed no1 in over 60 countries loved it cant wait for part 2
Dec 25 2023,positive,the movie does tell rather than show a bit too much but for what was going to be star wars movie it was way better than the last three main star wars saga movies i think they had great actors but horrible and pretentious writing this was at least entertaining without plot flaws it grew on me more with the second viewing looking forward to part 2
Dec 25 2023,negative,1000 kings not sure you know what that means seeing how only one blood line died to end the line what happened to the other 999 i wanted to like this but did no one do a read thought
Dec 25 2023,positive,i loved the universe with strong themes and visual styleslooking forward to the directors cut and part 2
Dec 25 2023,positive,i love this movie kora and the rest of the characters are chosen very well the whole cast looks great kora is hot tarak is smoking hot those abs are to die for aris is very handsome the movie was very stylish and intensely vibrant
Dec 25 2023,negative,sooooo disappointing pretty generic predictable stuff
Dec 25 2023,neutral,its kind of like riddick without riddick or the witcher without geralt or die hard without john mcclane its got an imaginative world that takes itself seriously too seriously but no one to comment on it and let the audience in on the joke
Dec 25 2023,positive,yes this is indeed a mash up of different genres and prior story lines from other movies and plots however telling them and matching in one new story would be a daunting task but i think achieved in this movie     if the story is not your cup off tea the effects and cinematic experience alone would make any true scifi fan happy after all this is only part 1
Dec 25 2023,positive,kora was a hero who didnt want to be a hero but necessity brought out the bravery in her i like that she was not over confident sofia boutellas acting was superb for action scifi this film has a lot of heart it reminds me of when i first watched fellowship of the ring lotr part 1
Dec 25 2023,positive,mid story line good visuals  fine one to pass time with friends  popcorn will gladly see next part
Dec 25 2023,positive,hairy plower and the vikings of dune
Dec 25 2023,positive,great movie kept me engaged the whole time
Dec 25 2023,negative,this was a pretty but boring and derivative film  the good costumes most of the fight choreography cinematography etc  the bad poor character development bad storytelling derivate plot and loads of cliches  it is almost a b movie with cartoonishly evil villains a character that stays shirtless and oiled the entire movie and griffins
Dec 25 2023,positive,the heros journey is a age old tale this movie is a good heros journey tale in the spirit of many others it isnt deep but im really interested in the characters backstories its a good yarn that looks beautiful
Dec 25 2023,negative,the story is plagiarism of other better works the main character defeats all combatants that attempt to win the only reason we kept watching was to guess the next movie or franchise that would be plagiarized  we made it a game i will not continue to watch the following episodessequels
Dec 25 2023,positive,well enjoyable fun and characters i wanted to learn more about great music cgi was a little too obvious in places but jimmy wow i just enjoyed every bit of this movie and yes its obviously inspired by many other sci fi but give me more of this i would have preferred a more adult version of this movie to be honest though
Dec 25 2023,negative,horrible writing and pacing
Dec 25 2023,negative,worst movie ecer watched  wasted my time
Dec 25 2023,positive,was it the most ground breating thing ive ever seen no was it well made well acted fun and importantly new yes watch it have a good time
Dec 25 2023,positive,im blessed with suspension of disbelief being one of my abilities take all the critics whining about previously used scifi  tropes from other productions and reduce their significance if you are are watching this movie you know what youre gonna get maybe the critics need to find a new profession like reviewing the newest ancient greek tragedy found among the ashes of some wartorn city in the mideast this is scifi for entertaining those of us blessed with a level of suspension of disbelief that is not weak kneed at the sight of a sounds and sights that have been seen before     kora is good moody terrifying to those who are her enemy     the robot omg anthony hopkins is the voice and with more humanity than humanity itself brilliant     farmers who just want to dig in the earth and grow food what more humble and honorable people need defended against the merciless motherland in other movies     you want entertained enjoy the movie you want to feel like you are reliving your first ever glimpse of some childhood hero and villain grow up
Dec 25 2023,negative,this movie is a visual wonder but really falls flat everywhere else not nearly enough character development is attempted to make me interested or invested in this world and almost the entire plot can be traced to better scifi fantasy works i was so hopeful about seeing elements from other works i enjoyed warhammer star wars dune etc but i left seeing nothing but an unorganized uninspired mess of the elements with no clear passion im hopeful the second part will prove me wrong but so far im not impressed
Dec 25 2023,negative,a mix of scenes from star wars harry potter ww2 movies and dune simply weird
Dec 25 2023,positive,while not groundbreaking still an awesome movie with great visuals spoiler nemesis gave me anime vibes loved it cannot wait for part two and more
Dec 25 2023,positive,im watching it for the second time now it makes more sense zack is a genius storyteller everything about this film looks great the colors are magnificent the only thing i would add to it is more soundtrack music during the fighting
Dec 25 2023,negative,terrible basically a retelling of seven samurai but incredibly bad   the first few seconds of the movie she pauses the plow to move a rock then smells the dirt such a stupid moment i get the director is trying to set a character but it did not play well it only went downhill from there   how many characters do you need that are out for revenge against the empire because their entire planet was wiped out and they are the sole survivor i counted at least 4 couldnt someone have written a unique backstory   no dialog between the gathered warriors they all just accept the story at hand and to go along for the ride   if each of the warriors are found so easily why couldnt the empire have picked them off before
Dec 25 2023,negative,a really expensive piece of trash character development was utterly trash action was deplorable dialogue was incredibly shallow
Dec 25 2023,positive,such a breath of fresh air compared to the garbage from star wars marvel and dc recently     you can tell the director didnt pay the tomato fee to get a good score  i mean if you read for some reason companies can just pay for a good  score explains a lot tbh
Dec 25 2023,negative,this movie was so bad i made an account to say it was bad i saw that the audience reviews were much higher theres lot of good movies with 6070 ratings but this one just sucks so i made an account to lower the average do not waste your time this movie was so inconsistent and stupid the costumes were so bad the villains had a mix of space nazi outfits us army lookalike outfits and these weird clergymen things it felt like they were using whatever leftover props they didnt use on other projects they stole elements from like every space sci fi they could the story was basic and lacked depth they went on journeys for numerous characters which ended up serving no purpose this movie was laughablethe special effects were cool though
Dec 25 2023,negative,this movie is a mess and cesspool of poor storytelling poor character work poor cgi with many narratives and tropes copied from far better works and i almost forgot about the cringe dialogue and hamfisted exposition dump
Dec 25 2023,positive,rebel moon looks great most of the time the story feels off until towards the end of the film what happens there makes earlier questions mostly answered like the force awakens the sequel will determine how much i like this one in the future on its own first reaction 6510
Dec 25 2023,negative,it was aaaawful for bad movies this one went plaid a pair of out of work writers from the pornography screenwriters guild could of drummed up a better script overnight the cinematography was really cool and well done outside of that puke
Dec 25 2023,positive,i liked this movie  it is very entertaining and the special effects are very good  i would dare compare it to star wars and it is better than all the other space adventure scifi that has come out recently  i look forward to the second movie
Dec 25 2023,negative,one of the most boring and over all not visually appealing  very disappointed in this movie
Dec 25 2023,negative,this actually had potential but i kept waiting for it to suddenly make sense by the time i realized it wasnt going to the film was half over and id seen nothing but derivatives of a half dozen other ips mashed together in an incoherent mess the only reason it gets half a star is its nice to look at
Dec 25 2023,positive,its cool space and fantasy movie
Dec 25 2023,positive,i think the movie was great the action sequence was wonderful the cgi was jawdropping i enjoy movies like this because it draws me away from everyday life and bring me somewhere else other than here in the current realm of society     i would recommend this movie to anyone
Dec 25 2023,positive,nice to see an orginal story and not a remake of an 80s movie     be very interesting to see where it goes 
Dec 25 2023,negative,sloppy incoherent storyline endless stream of uninteresting characters with dumb introduction stories not to mention the badly copied platera of better movies the robots acting was the least mechanical of them all 
Dec 25 2023,positive,these so called critics are clueless we get it you dont like scifi  dont watch it then    this is very good if it happened in space i most likely watched it  take it from a fan of sci fi not from these critics trying to make a name for themselves  critics will be critical i just love scifi movies
Dec 25 2023,negative,train wreck worst movie in a brutal year for film
Dec 25 2023,positive,sofia boutella as kora is here to stay as a new strong female character     anthony hopkins as jimmy will steal your heart     and     rebel moon is a brand new unique story that will leave you asking for more    i cant wait to see what is next from this new epic universe
Dec 25 2023,negative,terrible boring story boring action really looked good from trailers sorely disappointed
Dec 25 2023,negative,amazing visuals the history looks a poorly written plot of a video game designed to get sci fi fans a series of copies and stereotypes
Dec 25 2023,positive,on the scale of star wars to dune this movie is right in middle   not even close as great as dune but way better than any star wars movie
Dec 25 2023,negative,please dont make another one unless you are reviving mst3000 seriously please dont i was kidding about the mst3000
Dec 25 2023,positive,i found this movie visually spectacular and the sound stage absolutely wonderful visually and this viscerally stunning in my home theater the crashing of one of the larger ships had me experience some of the bass in my system that i had never felt before its a bit too much like so many other movies but unique enough that i very much willing to get five stars its a combination of star wars a taste of dune and other movies very much interested in watching the second half and hope that this becomes a long series of movies
Dec 25 2023,positive,this movie is far better than these so called expert critics say it is
Dec 25 2023,positive,i enjoyed the movie very much  waiting for the second part
Dec 25 2023,negative,deplorable character development   horrible writing   bad cgi   abysmal cinematography   terrible fight choreography   questionable direction     it was like a made for the scifi channel ripoff of star wars and warhammer
Dec 25 2023,negative,storybuilding isnt strong in this one  acting and visual effects are pretty decent though not enough to make the movie good great or exceptional  i find the costume choices for baddies to be unoriginal and derivative of 1940s germans you know the ones  sadly it fails to give any depth to the protagonists or meaningful backstory  i really wanted to enjoy this movie but it fails to deliver any greatness whatsoever  sad
Dec 25 2023,positive,it was a little slow at first the second half of the movie was excellent cant wait for the part 2
Dec 25 2023,positive,this movie was awesome these critics are too full of themselves it reminded me of the second riddick movie fun space hero movie with cool characters and plot cant wait till the second one def check this movie out
Dec 25 2023,negative,pg13 rating is a mistake holding back an actual full cut with an r rating calling it a directors cut just gets more attention and views on the film when it doesnt need it  this movie isnt even fun and i dont care to see the second part because i dont care about the characters at all  i wouldve rather seen an r rated directors intended cut that was fun and had any passion to it  this is lifeless
Dec 25 2023,positive,i think if the advertising for this show had stayed away from it being influenced by star wars my expectations would have been different i liked some of the plot twists some of the characters but i constantly found myself comparing scenesthe bar scene the landers that robot or android to star wars and it wasnt close nor do i think it was meant to be i will watch part ii but i am better prepared for what to expect
Dec 25 2023,positive,it was awesome love the cast and the story warhammer meets star wars
Dec 25 2023,positive,i love fantasy but not space movies  like not really into star wars  and thought it was fun and entertaining to watch is it deep no but enjoyable and visually gorgeous
Dec 25 2023,negative,the worst movie of the year a plodding pretentious collection of cliches this movie thinks its so edgy but as every conscious attempt at edginess it comes across as puerile save yourself 2hrs
Dec 25 2023,positive,entertaining enough a little too obviously derivative of some great movies and fell a bit flat visually great they should have employed a script writer
Dec 25 2023,positive,fairly entertaining not original but some great visual effects
Dec 25 2023,positive,visual effects are awesome i liked everything about it cant wait for part 2
Dec 25 2023,positive,visually stunning and engaging characters
Dec 25 2023,negative,if you must torture yourself for 2 hrs well then do i have the perfect movie for you     haha this was just a poor compilation of  slow motion scenes edited by a 10 yr old you will feel zero connections to any of those characters you wont care if anyone lives or dies let alone this revolution     jokes on me though because i still watched 1 hour of this before giving up
Dec 25 2023,negative,wowa that was hard to sit through
Dec 25 2023,negative,yikes i really hoping this would be a great movie it was kind of cheesy and nothing original seems like zac just took different ideas and put them together i dont think i will bother seeing the second half
Dec 25 2023,positive,its an entertaining movie good action and visuals if you are looking for something that is close to reality you will be disappointed but for pure entertainment and as a fiction it is great and is a visual treat
Dec 25 2023,negative,loud boring pointless and awkward rebel moon wears many grand inspirations on its sleeve from star wars to seven samurai to warhammer 40k to princess of mars and beyond and yet somehow pulls all the wrong lessons from those sources the end result is a painful dull selfindulgent slog that occasionally flirts with some genuinely good ideas only to squander them unfortunately this movie is simply not worth anyones time
Dec 25 2023,neutral,have you ever read steven erikssons malazan book of the fallen bookseries its an epic highfantasy series well worth the read but its always been kinda lovehate due to its complexity and unwillingness to hold the reader by hisher hand the story told in the series takes place in a world with hundreds of thousands of years of history and context and for lack of a better metaphor basically throws the reader into the deep end of the pool to sink or swim those of us that learned to swim learned to love the books the ones who drowned not so much    the books work in part because they build and present strong and memorable characters that can drive the story and keep it coherent when the context is missing this takes time effort and a clever pen but eriksson lives up to the challenge and the series is well hailed as one of the great ones    this movie made me think of eriksson this i think is how a movie would look if someone decided to make an erikssoninspired film with deep lore and lots of complexity and context but forgot about the part where they also needed strong and believable characters to drive the story forwards because they most assuredly did forget about the need for believable characters that is    dont get me wrong the characters are strong any and all of em seems capable of taking out an entire platoon of soldiers at any given time at least until the plotarmour weakens that sadly does not mean that the characters are believable or able to carry the films lacking scrip or pacing because the movie is sadly underwritten in this regard the scrips consist of people talking  at  each other often in an unintended parodically manner not people talking  to each other in any meaningful way and the pacing is not just lacking its plain gone often we are forced to witness a moreorless random scene where people  who have just met and doesnt know each other  tell of the most intimate things in order to either establish some sort of tragic background or to make us believe that this is a sort of bonding moment between the characters to say that its unbelievable is an understatement    in sum we are left with a bunch of stereotypical archetypes  an assassin a rebel a misunderstood and most likely unfairly judged traitor the mandatory actual traitor the tragic general a prince and a few others i can remember just now they are all honourable have a stereotypical trait or two and are willing to take up the fight with the evil overlords who conveniently dress talks and acts like nazis random violence and torture included so that the storyline can soldier on this is not the way to build or present your characters this is not the way to tell a complex story or at least a simple story in a complex context this is  simply  not good enough     the visuals are for the most part pretty good there are some good action scenes here and there the movie overall is mediocre but ok enough for the first hour and a half but the last hour takes it into the land of the unintended and unwillingly funny and not in a good way
Dec 25 2023,positive,the critics are far too biased this was cinematic joy i take one star away for a five minute section with average visuals and dialogue beyond that this was 2 hours of fantastic entertainment why we watch movies 
Dec 25 2023,positive,starts a little slow not normally a fan of unexplained super tech but this gets it very good a scify junkie and this hit the mark
Dec 25 2023,negative,rebel moon was predictable as hell i got about half an hour into the film and couldnt put myself through it any longer off it went
Dec 25 2023,positive,a breath of fresh air in modern scifi films nowadays great background story for kora and i hope we could see more of the background stories for the rest of the rebel squads in the directors cut or in part ii slowmo scenes are well delivered to emphasized the impact of the scene the only downside of the movie is the lens blur for some of the scenes hampering the cgi
Dec 25 2023,negative,mute the movie and make up your own storyline  the dialogue is garbage the plot is cobbled tropes from at least 5 other franchises  chronicles of riddick meets star wars meets seven samurai meets a stream of consciousness from three nights of disconnected dreams  i do feel sorry for the actors who were given this script with what im sure were promises of the snyder magic  the only thing i thought was cool were the robots which disabled and grasped the rebels  the bounty hunter switcharoo might has well been the subtitle  not impressed
Dec 25 2023,positive,villains strong  heros brilliant  classic story told many times before still good  over and over again looking forward to part 2
Dec 25 2023,negative,there were moments only brief moments of a good movie they were quickly interrupted by unnecessary slow motion sequences i think they could have easily shaved 35 minutes off the movie if they would of left out half of the slow motion scenes    overall it was a quality cast and a really good story that was cut short by horrible direction and more slow motion than should be allowed by law
Dec 25 2023,positive,i personally enjoyed the movie but think it would have been better off as multi episode series to go more in depth and show off its array of interesting characters introducing each felt rushed and didnt really flow with the whole story graphics and action scenes were decent but the overall directing style was weird for me personally still it was a good watch and i look forward to part 2
Dec 25 2023,positive,rebel moon looks like the best video game played by a bad gamer that i have ever seen the story seems to have been written by chatgtp or someone edited the movie while blindfolded  it is sad because the visuals are the most stunning that i have seen in a scifi movie  i just wish that they had invested more than 1 of their funds into the writing
Dec 25 2023,negative,this is a genuinely a bad movie i usually enjoy movies that get a good audience score and a bad critic score but this was absolutely trash    the plot is bad the pacing is bad the acting is bad there is literally nothing saving this movie    i love scifi and wish this was even mindlessly fun it is not i honestly cant believe the same director that made watchmen made this trash
Dec 25 2023,positive,good flick good character development good tension great aliens sire it borrows here and there but how can you not everyrhings been done if you like sci fi watch this
Dec 25 2023,positive,i like how the exact review number never moves on rotten tomatoes despite thousands of new votes coming in its set at at number at the beginning very strange
Dec 25 2023,positive,absolutely loved it it was one of the best visual movies ive ever seen absolutely impressed i dont understand the criticism will watch again 
Dec 25 2023,negative,how can this be so impossibly bad in the year 2023 of our lord dont waste your time with the bad fx terrible script horrible action scenes this is a movie for 13 year olds made in 1995 for the scifi channel bad fights bad acting the characters speak like video game cartoons expositing things in the most basic terms on the big green blurry screen  2 for painful hours nothing makes sense in this mess
Dec 25 2023,positive,visually stunning with a deep universe with diverse aliens and cultures the technology is advanced but seems rooted in science  the protagonist is believable particularly when fighting she isnt a jedi or rambo but an expertly trained elite soldier she gets knocked around and hit but always gets up  the supporting characters all have believable motives for their actions i cant wait to see the next movie
Dec 25 2023,positive,while not the best scifi plot wise it scratched that itch for me part1 seemed more focused on world building rather than character but im excited to see what comes in part 2 admittedly there were times i wished the story began and covered the exposition as plot but cest la vie
Dec 25 2023,positive,predictable fast but good budget nice watch dont really feel contented to anyone but invested enough to watch the second star wars dupe
Dec 25 2023,positive,rebel moon is a visually a stunning movie  it also has great action and a great story  it was supposed to be his star wars movie   but instead we got this and i couldnt be happier definitely one of the best sifi movies  to date
Dec 25 2023,positive,well done setting up the story hate waiting for part 2
Dec 25 2023,positive,it was popcornmovie fun  it was not on a literary level with lord of the rings but very few fantasy works are
Dec 25 2023,negative,boring movie waste of time
Dec 25 2023,positive,no revolution but i enjoyed it
Dec 25 2023,positive,i think people are being to hard on this movie i mean for the type of movie it is i think they did a pretty good job
Dec 25 2023,negative,this is one of the blandest films ive seen in a very long time what a shambels of terrible accents poor story telling poor acting weirdly cut cgi sequences desperate to be different from anything yet so far from anything at all its like a weird warhammerstar warsdune and mishmash of other action films all jumbled together with a predictable outcome and yet feels like 2 hours of just having your brain smashed against a wall really sorry for all the work people put into this but its just not good it sadly isnt
Dec 25 2023,positive,this movie has amazing potential it starts out quite good and then goes downhill writing gets worse and worse the pacing is weird slow yet rushed and the motivations of people are either unclear or halfbaked    this movie would be better as a video game with cutscenes or a tv show with a slower pace and better though out scenes
Dec 25 2023,positive,i thought it was really good i hope the entire worlds and plans for the future does not disappear because bad reviews
Dec 25 2023,negative,it was as if someone decided to reimagine star wars without humor a coherent plot or engaging characters
Dec 25 2023,negative,if you are a fan of kicking yourself repeatedly in the junk or v in slow motion then we have the perfect film for you if they could shoot someone for wasting money and time the world would have some better movies
Dec 25 2023,negative,was able to make about a third of the way through before i got bored  nothing new here seen it all before  weaponry and space ship atrocious  every actor has a movie they regret making and this will be jenna malones and why do all bad guys have to look like nazis  im a huge sci fi fan and was really looking forward to this one  but the trailer was the only redeeming quality of this movie  id like to see statistics on what percentage of people started watching this but didnt finish
Dec 25 2023,positive,great acting and characters  alot crammed into a short time frame  looking forward to expanded cut and learning more of the lore
Dec 25 2023,negative,pff fell asleep   a slow movie too many characters
Dec 25 2023,negative,naff unoriginal ripoffs of every sci fi trope with a dash of buckbeak thrown in gave up mid way through as it was just too painful to watch
Dec 25 2023,negative,so where can i start i did not finish it looks like a waste of time     the story is as old as it gets nothing new under the sun other than the interstellar context but that could have worked if the rest would have been at least ok     some green screen shots are just plain bad       bad acting with just a few exceptions   difficult to buy in to the decisions of some characters the story goes so fast that just it does not like the missing pieces it was so easy to understand where it will go such poor decision making for the main characters while on a big journey    fight choreography makes you think there is no choreography everything is random some slow motion scenes are ridiculous the actors definitely had no reference for the cgi     artistically is beautiful but unfortunately that fades as everything else unveils     disappointed
Dec 24 2023,positive,really good love the graphics and the action sequences i dont know the review is so low cant wait for part two
Dec 24 2023,positive,i thought movie was great  i enjoyed it immensely
Dec 24 2023,negative,this movie was terrible  it felt like 6 different ideas jammed into an overall concept that isnt believable kind of dune mixed with a bad star wars and some dnd concepts none of which are good the characters are boring the action over used slow motion to make it look interesting  total garbage
Dec 24 2023,negative,not worth your time
Dec 24 2023,positive,dont listen to the critics this movie is awesome
Dec 24 2023,positive,the movie is slowpaced but has good open stories at the end like dune so you know they will make a part 2
Dec 24 2023,positive,its not bad  its not good its just fun
Dec 24 2023,negative,a star wars knock off with no character development forgettable villain and meh story line nice visual effects but overall total lack of originality
Dec 24 2023,positive,pretty good i enjoyed it will watch again
Dec 24 2023,negative,it was ok very long and unnecessary at times     i was bored most of the time and not really paying attention to most because of the writing     its an off brand star wars and was very annoying to watch at times     its more a back ground noise while im doing something around the house
Dec 24 2023,positive,its hilarious in ways it didnt mean to be i cant wait for the next one this movie is so bad its fun
Dec 24 2023,positive,better than anything else around right now   dont take it too seriously
Dec 24 2023,negative,dull very thin plot  no character development the only fun bit was trying to name which sci films has been graverobbed and stitched together in this frankenstein of a film absolute embarrassing trash the characters were so poor i wouldnt have cared if theyd all been killed at the end
Dec 24 2023,positive,if you rate a movie on it steals from other movies you are not rating the movie are you all the star wars movies stole their content from foundation trilogy star trek etc     this movie is entertaining that should be the only thing that matters its visually high class has solid characters engaging back stories perfect no fun to watch yes unless you are so jaded that you cannot suspend your disbelief for a couple of hours why bother watching scifi movies at all then    cant wait for part 2
Dec 24 2023,positive,the film is ok you can tell that its been cut down and parts are missing would be better if little more character development also as there is no one im invested in    pacing is all over place and story is very meh and needs fleshing out not sure just two parts are enough for this franchise to give it any justice
Dec 24 2023,positive,a classical scifi  space opera the kind you rarely see nowadays
Dec 24 2023,negative,good visual effects but the story is extremely underwhelming  i would say it would have benefited from a longer run time but im afraid that time would just be filled with more useless set pieces instead of actual world building
Dec 24 2023,positive,the plot seems to speed along not giving a lot of time to understand the motivations of the characters however overall though the movie was very entertaining the visuals were great and the actionfighting scenes were fun to watch looking forward to part 2 coming out next year i cant wait to see where the plot goes from here
Dec 24 2023,positive,hatters gonna hate but this movie is 1010 love it  the story is epic 
Dec 24 2023,negative,decorated in beautiful visuals and character designs this space opera is a mixed bag incredible cinematography and great battle scenes arent enough to make us care for the main cast
Dec 24 2023,positive,its a fun popcorn film and that is all i needed it to be some characters are deeper and some could certainly be better the plot isnt shawshank redemption but its like a saturday morning scifi cartoon in the end i enjoyed it
Dec 24 2023,positive,great action and visuals great performances from the cast wanted the characters to be more fleshed out
Dec 24 2023,negative,one of the worst movies i have ever watched complete waste of my time story was basically a copy of a bugs life lmao
Dec 24 2023,positive,i thought this was a good movie  the film does a great job at structuring and shaping the world as well as character development  i am a scifimilitary geek and a gamer  there was plenty of combat type action on the ground as well as intergalactic type battles  the movie did keep my attention and i enjoyed it
Dec 24 2023,negative,looked like terrible the story was generic and the acting made my stomach hurt
Dec 24 2023,positive,its mid and a ripoff of warhammer 40k
Dec 24 2023,negative,stereotypical cliche characters are just being thrown in one by one with weak character development or explanation actors overacting makes you roll your eyes almost every minute there is also a massive overuse of slomo which becomes frustrating after 30 minutes of the movie and spoils every action scene the cgi looks expensive but its pretty soulless like in the newer marvel movies and the story is nothing more than okish i guess   there are a lot better ways to spend 2 hours
Dec 24 2023,negative,rushedno time to fully engage and get to know the characters
Dec 24 2023,negative,theres no depth to the characters or any of the relationships its all rushed and some of the decisions within the movie make no sense and got to a point it was frustrating to watch was really hoping it would be a good one but was very disappointing and unoriginal
Dec 24 2023,negative,you have seen this movie before because a lot of ideas images and lines were taken from better movies it is a blend star wars seven samurai and you name it rip off with alot of slow motionbut without soul humor and interesting characters
Dec 24 2023,positive,i loved this movie its exactly as advertiseda retelling of 7 samurairight down to riding into the sunset music amazing cinematography amazing story straightforward cant wait for the second part     im lost on the critics lows scores its what it was designed to be and wonderful to watch
Dec 24 2023,positive,anticipation was well worth the wait nice work on character development
Dec 24 2023,negative,i wish we could give none of a star     what can i say  snyder slooooooooow moooootiiiionnnn    awfullllll movie
Dec 24 2023,positive,excellent and epic i watched it today and enjoyed it immensely havent seen a movie this good in this genre since rogue one including star wars vii viii and ix which were pure garbage and probably cost 20 times more cant wait to see the extended version and the sequel simply straightforward and wellexecuted
Dec 24 2023,negative,visually this movie is on par with the best of its peers storyline is a bit weak and it feels like they cut up several other stories and then jumbled the bits up to make this story there are parts that are simply left without explanation and it just didnt feel very cohesive towards the end everything moved so quickly that it felt forced and it felt like they were running out of screen time so much of this just isnt explained it is moderately entertaining but there is a major lack of introduction to things and several major plot holes and frankly stale plot elements
Dec 24 2023,negative,you can tell it was supposed to be a disney star wars movie by how much it sucks
Dec 24 2023,negative,dull over use of slo mo  characters are all one level stereotypes  style over substance comes to mind and overall just boring
Dec 24 2023,positive,good scifi fun legendary eh maybe not but well worth a watch bits  pieces reminded me here  there of jupiter ascending avatar star wars dune foundation and even a touch of star trek though ultimately tells its own story dont understand all the horrific reviews thought it was good fun and am already watching a second time the next day excited to see the culmination in part 2
Dec 24 2023,positive,i liked it seems promising cant wait to see part 2
Dec 24 2023,positive,rebel moon aka gomora vs thanos is a great origin story however after all the talk about the use of slowmotion i was kind of hurt that there is very little slowmotion in the film wayyyy less than justice league anyway the film is about a girl assembling a team to build an army to protect a village and its scifi with aliens  its awesome great action great character backgrounds great visuals overall great story
Dec 24 2023,positive,should have been longer seemed a bit rushed good visuals and fun characters and a decent bad guy
Dec 24 2023,negative,they are just circling around
Dec 24 2023,negative,its a bad adaptation of akira kurosawas 7 samurai if you wanted to insult him with added cringe in slowmo too much slowmo thats why it last 2 hrs which i was robbed of
Dec 24 2023,negative,every scene every ethetics every single character in this feels like its straight ripped off another franchise there are things much more interesting you can spend 2 hours on
Dec 24 2023,positive,quite clearly world setting and setting up for part 2 looking forward to the next parts release
Dec 24 2023,negative,what absolute garbage
Dec 24 2023,negative,this movie is so boring and ridiculous like a high school theater project
Dec 24 2023,negative,the most only thing worse than the atrocious acting was the almost impossibly vacuous screenplay  dont waste your time like i did
Dec 24 2023,neutral,first 20 minutes were great then went downhill the rest of the way  the ships and outfits were pretty neat but the dialogue and story was crazy bad   villain did all the heavy lifting protagonist sucked
Dec 24 2023,positive,while i wouldnt say that i was completely blown away by this movie i can say that i enjoyed this movie enough that i want to see more and look forward to seeing what happens in the next one thats really all i can ask for in a movie
Dec 24 2023,negative,with mediocre visual effects easy fight scenes a bit obvious character arc and way too much trying to be a dune  star wars crossover this movies has left me bored and not entertained i was very much looking forward to this movie but unfortunately anything above a 50 tomatoscore is just not it even for the easy minded and not so critical people there are way better alternatives for a great scifi movienight rebel moon just isnt good
Dec 24 2023,positive,samurai 7 meets star wars i hope the second part ties everything together
Dec 24 2023,negative,what the hell was  that  like really  feels like the  starfield game  lol
Dec 24 2023,positive,firstly i do think this was a promising story i thought boutella was great as kora and most of the special effects were clean and looked great    however i think this film fell into the trap of following the sci fi epic cliches evil faction trying to take over the universe but being stopped by a unlikely band of rebels against the odds sound familiar and films that do that are never going to live up to star wars which is why they need to be a sci fi epic in their own right rather than leaning too heavily on these influences even down to naming one of the main warships of the motherworld the imperium dreadnought lets just say the movie wasnt the most original    i also feel the story was thin and slightly rushed and dialogue a little disjointed at times plus id like to have seen a bit more character development as well as background were thrown into this epic space story with a 2 minutes briefing of the history of this universe and absolutely no information on these characters when we meet them who they are where they come from what their story is the only character you could say developed and we found a little about was kora and the most promising character was one we see the least of jimmy unless you class ed skreins atticus giving a 10 second description of why each character hates the motherworld as background things did feel a little frantic on top of that occasionally some of the visuals were uneasy on the eye and hunhams accent i truly hope his character is dead so i dont have to hear his accent again in any upcoming rebel moon media     that being said it wasnt all bad and i am invested in seeing where the saga leads us and look forward to the sequel with anticipation the action sequences were a positive as they were well choreographed and the majority of acting and special effects were enjoyable as well i do want to see more of kora and see where her story arc goes plus how the motherworld reacts to the ending of part 1 despite the shortcomings there is something about the film pulling me back in for more     i perhaps was expecting a bit more of the wow factor and originality from the team behind the film and the budget behind them theyre not exactly amateurs room for improvement but if you are a lover of scifi and have a couple of hours free its worth a watch
Dec 24 2023,negative,you order star wars on wish they deliver rebel moon
Dec 24 2023,positive,i thought it was better than professional critics gave it credit for and i didnt think it ended on an unsatisfying cliff hanger knowing part 2 is coming out fairly soon however it did feel like it could have been longer a lithe more character development in the secondary characters would have been nice
Dec 24 2023,negative,nonononononononono  cheap copy pasta from every sci fi flick except poorly done  it even ends with a matrix like scene and i swear elon musk can sue because they used the term neuralink  it started with promise but then turned to boring cliche predictable absolute garbage  it just kept dragging on  its the plot of the magnificent seven except in space and poorly executed since the characters are boring and feel disposable  from space vikings to space nazis followed by space irish and space mexicans and the space indian then the space scotsman comes along  and they find the space jamaican and they go from space finland to space mexico   zero originality  youd swear it was max payne at times the way they liberally apply bullet time  they overdo the bullet time scenes  it makes you wanna vomit they slow everything down to try to make miniscule actions seem breathtaking and some scenes drag on for like 10 minutes and add nothing to the story  you literally wishing you could take the time you wasted watching it back  all the hype for this trash  pass please  youll thank me
Dec 24 2023,positive,i dont know why everyone is comparing this to star wars this is the best 40k movie we have gotten so far
Dec 24 2023,negative,if you prefer your movie to be entirely in slow motion while casting quality actors in wooden roles and not allowing anyone to higher a proper writer then this movie will probably be fine its like poor food that wasnt even seasoned but then someone painted to look really pretty he makes enjoyable movies when someone else writes them for him
Dec 24 2023,positive,the large number of negative reviews meant that i approached this film with low expectations but its a good film with great action scenes and special effects im looking forward the part two and hope that they do more films and tv shows in this universe
Dec 24 2023,positive,enjoyed the escape from reality
Dec 24 2023,negative,writing is so insanely bad
Dec 24 2023,negative,some of the visuals were cool the movie feels like a dd session run by a 10 year old kid running for the first time without a clear story in mind but just grabbing scenes  encounters that he or she thought were cool from the different movies he or she has seen there was no character development no reason to care about any of the characters and nothing interesting happening in the story the movie should have a warning in the opening credits not to create a drinking game every time there is slow motion since that will certainly result in death by alcohol poisoning the villains in any scooby doo episode have far more depth and far more realistic motivations than the emp impe errr motherworld space baddies this was bad the only reason why i would give rebel moon an edge over awful last jedi is that at least rebel moon wasnt urinating on a franchise that i actually cared about this movie was not good
Dec 24 2023,negative,there are ingredients for an interesting story this isnt it the pros are mostly good visual effects and a good performance by ed skrein as the main villain unfortunately the script is more tell than show and the story is little more than a retelling of seven samurai in a blended star wars and warhammer skin with paper thin characters most of whom are entirely forgettable im not sure the promised extended version in the future can save this and its unfortunate that its even necessary for it carry that burden
Dec 24 2023,positive,i think it is one of the better films i have seen in 2023  dont agree with the score critics are giving  very satisfying scifi  would have been a great star wars film  
Dec 24 2023,positive,decent film drags on a bit a mix of the magnificent 7 and star wars
Dec 24 2023,negative,i wanted to like this movie but the opening scene cgi was on par with the painted backdrops of 70s era scifi seriesand it was down hill from there  not a single original concept to be found ensures youll be 5 steps ahead of this story from start to finish  more painful exposition than a star wars prequel  textbook example of how important good writing isand what happens when it isnt oh and the title should have been vikings vs nazis in space
Dec 24 2023,negative,its so bad looks like bad trip star wars   suicide squad and too much slow motion
Dec 24 2023,negative,ridiculous ive managed only about 30 minutes torturing myself with that awful
Dec 24 2023,positive,i wasnt sure about the movie but within the first 30 minutes the movie causes you to be drawn in i definitely enjoyed the movie there were parts that felt drawn or not needed but overall its a worthy experience for someone who enjoys a star wars star trek type feel the movie is daring and excels making you wonder or take the edge of your seat
Dec 24 2023,positive,fun movie and it looks like that part 2 is going to be even better the only thing i didnt get is that it takes too long in introducing characters but with not enough depth to care for them
Dec 24 2023,positive,the thing about films is that theres very little thats truly original especially true of sci fi so the fact this has elements of star wars matrix dune etc is to be expected that it does it quite well comes as a pleasant surprise fast paced great heroine and baddie to unite against excellent visuals all made for a real treat looking forward to the next
Dec 24 2023,negative,nice polish but thats all stiff wooden dialogue no character development no sense of danger urgency direction or plot whatever ideas can be found are all stolen from kurosawa pandora tattoine or similar places i dont care if the main chars live or die i dont believe in the places or sets it all seem to have been made on the same parking lot in one word terrible
Dec 24 2023,negative,dogcrap full of cliche
Dec 24 2023,negative,the movie is not bad little boring very predictable and some scenes ty at makes no sense at all the camara focusangles or background blurs make this movie almost unwatchable i was struggling such bad quality
Dec 24 2023,positive,visually stunning with a mash up of all your favorite sci fi fills in one where it struggles is with its character development making it hard to draw an emotional attachment to them the extended edition might fix that
Dec 24 2023,negative,this movie was badly written the script is soo bad soo bad the acting is subpar yes but the script is soooo bad sooo bad
Dec 24 2023,positive,the best movie of the year
Dec 24 2023,negative,pretty visuals however the entire 2 12 hour long plot is just collecting companions on different planets if i wanted that experience ill just play starfield
Dec 24 2023,positive,not sure there is an original idea in this movie  many of the scene ideas came from star wars and guardians of the galaxy movies  visuals were stunning though
Dec 24 2023,negative,this movie was so bad i created a rotten tomatoes account to review it    just a ripoff of other great sci fi films     some of the worst cgi in a blockbuster film    terrible and cliche villain    its boring filled with slo mo and exposition dump    some of the most cringiest and terrible dialogue to the point i would just laugh especially ray fishers characters dialogue    speaking of ray fishers character his name is bloodaxe which made me laugh because it made think of guardians of the galaxy volume 2 where james gunn made fun of dumb names like tazorface    just wait for the directors cut because at least that one will be filled sex and titties to keep you entertained
Dec 24 2023,positive,if you go into it expecting star wars you will be disappointed however if you go into it expecting a good scifi movie you will be pleasantly surprised it is a good space adventure movie
Dec 24 2023,negative,i imagine this is the movie we would get if we entered the following prompt into chat gpt    make a movie in the style of star wars with even more stilted dialogue and no endearing heroes or villains make sure the score is the opposite of anything john williams could write oh put a couple of light sabres in there
Dec 24 2023,positive,i dont know what movie these critics watched but what i saw was a pretty fun movie maybe the published reviews lowered my expectations or maybe some of these critics have become too jaded to enjoy their jobs anymore movie was fun no more derivative than most movies being released these days and at least it wasnt some stupid remake which nobody really wants or needs   ed skrein was perfectly cold and creepy as the main villain and the rest of the cast was decent looking forward to the next movie and hope they make more after that
Dec 24 2023,positive,creativity outweighs the similarity
Dec 24 2023,negative,awful theres no story its just a series of cut scenes from agame noone wanted
Dec 24 2023,positive,overall the movie was enjoyable    reminded me more of warhammer genre over starwars   the movie has great potential and looking forward to part 2
Dec 24 2023,positive,i liked it  it has clear starwars vibes for obvious reasons but with grit and less cheese a good part 1 intro story that left me wanting more i just hope it doesnt stop at part 2 only criticism was that it didnt pick up the pace a little sooner
Dec 24 2023,positive,with fight scenes stylistically reminiscent of sucker punchs fight scenes this is a must see for fans of zack snyders work hes also the cinematographer on the movie so it looks amazing its possibly a little disjointed and truncated but im expecting that to be addressed in the directors cut which was made concurrently with this release and is supposedly like a whole different movie
Dec 24 2023,positive,not sure why the low score this was one of the best movies to end 2023 grinches should just go back to hibernation
Dec 24 2023,positive,this movie was amazing people forget that any great story has bits and pieces of other great stories even star wars pulls pieces from the foundation this movie was another important step for science fiction do not let narrowminded people turn you away from this
Dec 24 2023,neutral,solid movie visually entertaining enough the r rated cut should be better though looking forward to that when it comes out
Dec 24 2023,positive,it was a fun movie that is what i wanted and what i got
Dec 24 2023,positive,i think the movie was really good 
Dec 24 2023,positive,its an intergalactic remake  of 7 samuraithe magnificent 7 but it works its good escapism which is sorely missed  right now in hollywood my only complaint is that zack takes too long introducing the characters and their is too much exposition visually the fight scenes are stunning yeah he does a lot of slowmo but they are fun and great to look at it not perfect but entertaining
Dec 24 2023,positive,the plot is exciting and wellconnected some fight scenes could be less evident they were choreographed as a star wars fan i see several elements from star wars in this movie
Dec 24 2023,negative,nice visuals which is a norm for synder but the story is generic and the characters are boring how he still makes movies is baffling to me
Dec 24 2023,positive,its not as good as i had hoped but i enjoyed it yes its derivative but so is every movie so using that as a reason to give it a bad review is a bit unfair the visuals and action were great the dialogue was meh the story does feel like its leading somewhere but the spoken exposition was a bit much would have liked to get the backstory in a better way ill say this though its better than all of the recent star wars movies except force awakens and rogue one
Dec 24 2023,negative,its all just pollox  the film is just a baltent ripoff of much better films theres nothing new here you may as well be watching star wars or dune or anything else made in the last 15 years very poor attempt zach synder
Dec 24 2023,negative,dude just watch star wars instead
Dec 24 2023,negative,if you want to watch a movie thats full of sexual tension has a character lead that looks constipated at all times and is chock full to the brim with slowmotion captures even the falling of grains has slowmo then this is the movie for you otherwise youd be bored to your wits and youd keep wondering what the heck is going on
Dec 24 2023,positive,i think the movie is awesome  it was filmed like an art house or graphic novel movie somewhat no expert but that is what it seems to me so it looks and feels a little different than what i was expecting  however once i understood that i was completely onboard  it draws on the seven samurai which might be the only little let down  not that the story isnt good but it has been done a lot  so you know where it is going  over all i think its a good watch and i really enjoyed it  looking forward to the next one    and personally i dont give two cents about the critics opinion they dont care about the audience and never did
Dec 24 2023,positive,loved it but it feels rushed the editing makes it feel like were missing some scenes and you can tell in the gun fights the laser shots leave some horrible wounds but we dont see them this is definitely a pg13 version  we need the rated r version now
Dec 24 2023,positive,amazing movie  i have no idea how it is only 23100 on rotten tomatoes  goes to show that this place is not credible
Dec 24 2023,negative,i understand this is a part one but it spends the majority of its runtime assembling its cast of characters in the most basic way then they barely interact or speak it gives us nothing for us to care about this group the little we learn about them is in the form of a one sentence description delivered by the villain near the end all the while lacking in any kind of originality     the lead gets the most backstory told in flashbacks which sounds like a much more interesting story truthfully most of the characters seem to have their more interesting stories already behind them     there are some nice visuals here and there but it also looks ugly at times too theres a good action sequence early and thats where the film peaked for me the third act is a pretty standard shootout its fine for a film to have a small scale conflict but there was so little going on throughout the movie that it felt like nothing happened at all     ultimately we got a derivative movie nothingcharacters thin plot inconsistent visuals and an unsatisfying end very disappointing
Dec 24 2023,negative,theres nothing new to see here there are space vikings space samurai and space nazis and a group of them form a league in a quest for justice theres plenty of cgi and slow motion shots but the story is seemingly written by an ai that understands all the familiar tropes but isnt interested in any of the details
Dec 24 2023,positive,this movie is not an original concept and borrows heavily from multiple stories youve already seen but that doesnt mean it lacks entertainment  the story is compelling and the visuals are top notch  well worth a watch and im looking forward to more
Dec 24 2023,negative,maybe among the worst of 2023 and one of the most difficult films in recent years to fully watch till the end     story really bland and slowpaced maybe with part 2 some parts make more sense but as a movie alone  no   characters uninteresting ed skrein did a pretty decent job   visuals maybe the worst part of this one the awful use of dof and ridiculous amount of slowmo usage makes some scenes look very bad the film itself has a grim unappealing look with some nice scenes    i cant recommend this movie to anyone  it felt like a waste of time
Dec 24 2023,positive,great first movie that feels like star wars mixed with the magnificent 7 some speeches about things are a bit cliche but overall it was a great action movie with a story good enough to keep it going and make you wonder where it goes in the sequel
Dec 24 2023,positive,ambitious dense scifi with some recycled tropes lack of character development and  some actors eg farmer not fully committed to their roles
Dec 24 2023,negative,rebel moon felt like a behind the scenes and vfx tutorial movie but instead of showing how they did it they just copy paste some show your emotion bits in between scenes from michiel huisman
Dec 24 2023,negative,i asked myself could it be that bad any reviews giving this more than 12 stars must have been written by the same bots that did the script half a star was kind
Dec 24 2023,positive,i liked it a lot i knew to watch out for a pacing thing and i had no issue with the middle bit being fast great to have a new scifi world over xmas ho ho ho
Dec 24 2023,positive,meh wasnt bad wasnt amazing   if you are looking to be entertained for a couple hours its not a bad choice  but dont expect a new incredible epic either    the good  effects and visual quality were great top notch  cast is solid and interesting  fightaction choreography is decent    the meh  starts a bit slow gets a bit better though  characters are somewhat interesting but not well developed yet  not much interplay between characters they are just existing next to each other  acting is ok  unlike star wars avengers or even lotr little humor   that can be good or bad depending on what you are looking for im ok with it    the bad  completely cliche plot is nothing new or groundbreaking  suspend your disbeliefplot holes abound    the above two points are my only major criticismsbut they are huge   the plot is predictable totally unrealistic even for a space scifi fantasy movie   how are these individuals supposed to fight a huge empire and space shipswith their swords and a pistol    if the writingplot were greatly improved it would very cool  but for now its kinda just ok   not a waste of time if you like action and scifi but dont expect an epic   id compare it to feature length the expanse with better effects and choreography but less interesting and more cliche plot
Dec 24 2023,positive,outstanding great special fx no wokery at all which is rare these days hence the disparity between critic and audience scores
Dec 24 2023,negative,tiresome confusing two hours of a special person storytrope whos kinda boring and ordinary
Dec 24 2023,positive,good story line but just some unnecessary scenes that should have been cut and to many slow motion shot takes you put of the movie a bit this seems more like a 1st draft
Dec 24 2023,positive,watched it with my girlfriend excited for part2 really cool star wars vibes
Dec 24 2023,positive,such a good casting action packed film a must see
Dec 24 2023,negative,boring over long dross  the worst film ive seen throughout the whole of 2023
Dec 24 2023,neutral,disappointing after all the hype  enough with the slow motion already
Dec 24 2023,positive,i liked it the visuals were awesome   maybe the acting itself wasnt the greatest
Dec 24 2023,negative,seven samurai in space has been done before underwater or in a volcano hasnt try that next time
Dec 24 2023,positive,really liked it a wh40k flavour in some way  given the last disney fiascos give me tons of these and less star wars  cant wait but have to for part two
Dec 24 2023,positive,i like that its not star wars and who doesnt like a good old fashioned seven samurai setup i think as a franchise it has lots of potential
Dec 24 2023,negative,i literally thought i was watching a bugs life the first part of rebel moon is nearly identical to a bugs life they come for the grain that has yet to be harvested intimide the natives and leave with the warning that all of the grain should be ready when they return in 10 weeks one week after the harvest should be complete or face a fate much more terrible than possibly starving     terrible movie boring long predictable and hard to watch if you didnt know what was about to happen next you probably already fell asleep
Dec 24 2023,positive,another one of the great zack snyders movies reviewbombed by bots and paidoff critics i for one enjoyed the movie i thought it was a cool new twist that brings you on a space adventure different from the ones weve seen before the movie was heartfelt action packed and an all around good time forget the bad reviews this is a must see
Dec 24 2023,negative,boring and horrible
Dec 24 2023,negative,you can turn off the sound and watch in the background while doing something else other than that this movie is a waste of time perhaps if movie director had an experienced screenwriter and director of photography  something more worthwhile would have come out of it
Dec 24 2023,negative,as with most synder movies out of proportion slow motion and action scenes horrendous story telling i watched for an hour and still had no clue what was going on dont waste your time
Dec 24 2023,negative,its like someone had asked chatgpt to write a script for the magnificent seven in space to say that it is derivative would be a kindness its more like a smorgasbord of lines and scenes plagiarized from other scifi movies the acting is wooden and the script is clunky  its like a bad star wars fan fic the writing makes george lucas seem as sophisticated and witty as oscar wilde also the director loves lens flare even more than jj abrams an absolute stinker
Dec 24 2023,positive,at its heart rebel moon is a fun ride who doesnt love the gathering of fallen heroes in pursuit of a lost cause and a chance at redemption it does borrow heavily from star wars warhammer 40k and the seven samurai its visually stunning and has a good pace it sets up a part 2 to be very interesting i encourage all scifi geeks to take a look and judge it for yourself
Dec 24 2023,negative,a full lack of imagination on display i am surprised the writer is not being sued for poor plagiarism dune star wars and the magnificent seven fans are vommitting in their mouths a little one of the worst character development arcs ever i had no buy in emotionally whoever gave the green light on this piece of stink should be resided to nickelodeon kid shows a big waste of time and money skip it 
Dec 24 2023,positive,it wastes a bit of time recruiting guys that at last they dont perform enough actions to give sense to them may be its because they will have more time in the sequel    it has original visuals that makes this film worth watch it
Dec 24 2023,positive,yeah its derivative but i was still entertained its quite refreshing to see a heros journey trope once more the film dragged a bit in the second act im looking forward to zacks cut more than this one
Dec 24 2023,positive,the tough thing with rebel moon is that it has so much going for it in visuals and uniqueness however story dialogue and some aspects of world building are a bit too unauthentic to make this a great film    entertaining enough for any scifi person to give it a look though
Dec 24 2023,negative,the only good part was the special effects  they even messed up the soundtrack as most lines were near impossible to hear over the backround noise in the fight sceens  there is no excuse for that its a mash up of stolen parts from other movies
Dec 24 2023,negative,meaningless violence interspersed with insipid dialogue and a tired plot
Dec 24 2023,negative,absolute dogs dirt with almost no redeeming features
Dec 24 2023,negative,rebel moon comes across as a notably downgraded version of star wars lacking the depth and maturity we expected the film feels overly childish with characters that fail to leave a lasting impression it struggles to establish a strong foundation leaving us with a sense of disappointment in my view its a disappointing movie with little promise for the future
Dec 24 2023,positive,without a doubt the most notable thing is this new universe and how incredible it is there are thousands of things to discover visually it is beautiful and has a nice story although there is still a lot to discover in the history of the other characters the villain of the movie is one of the best there is i cant wait for part 2
Dec 24 2023,negative,the cgi is jarring at times the dialogue can be cringey or just outright boring and pacing feels simultaneously too slow and constantly jumping around that said several of the scenes are visually stunning often quickly ruined by bad cgi or poor framing and the fight scenes are pretty cool though they have their own problems eg slowmo overall i probably wont watch part 2 unless the cgi gets some serious upgrades
Dec 24 2023,positive,visually stunning likable characters it is a fun ride and i look forward to part 2
Dec 24 2023,positive,epic great fun 7 samurai vibe but played out well with a great cast and scenery not sure why disney turned this down as a concept for a star wars story
Dec 24 2023,negative,absolute trash of movie makes me appreciate morbius movie acting was terrible script was terrible effects were meh  i was ugly cryinglaughing by the end at just how terrible this movie is i found myself confused as to whether i was missing out on a joke movie a spoof just bad
Dec 24 2023,positive,its just a fun scifi movie in my opinion its as good or better as the disneystar wars movies
Dec 24 2023,negative,im a big scifi fan i really wanted to like this movie i really did this plot was borrowed from other scifi before it he previews look great then the film only lasts 1 found or two in a 7 round fight it just kinda pulls its punches any twist the story line tries to build in can be seen coming a mile away i hope part 2 really picks up i really did want to like this movie
Dec 24 2023,positive,brilliant  loved it  only wish we didnt have to wait for part 2 hoping we get part 3 4 5 6
Dec 24 2023,negative,i did have to check who directed this because for a long time i thought i was watching a star wars reboot nothing original at all in this movie being part one i guess im committed to seeing part two in april although i will spare myself the definitely not needed directors cut due in the new year
Dec 24 2023,positive,i think all the negative reviews are over rated i watched it thinking it would be so bad but i loved the effects the characters and i got really drawn in by it the last 40 minutes is a bit of a mess but not as bad as all the reviews are making it out to bethe cinematography is excellent 
Dec 24 2023,negative,pretty sure i came up with this plot when i was 5 playing with my toys then they meet the spiderlady and shes like theyre killing my eggs and then the asian lady with the swords is like neoooooo vrooom pow and she kills the spiderlady      what the hell did first generation ai write this trash star and half for great visuals wouldve been better if it was a series of posters i could hang on my wall
Dec 24 2023,positive,has its problems like the excessive use of slow motion in some scenes but overall it is a great movie excited for part 2
Dec 24 2023,negative,terrible the film promised a lot but delivered very little some stunning visual effects but this does not make up for a terrible script main characters giving their own back story is a massive no for me especially in the first 5 minutes  did not enjoy it at all
Dec 24 2023,negative,the actors played their parts well the set pieces stunning the costume design threw me for a loop and completely shattered any futuristic world building they had in mind what kind of general in an army wears a suit and tie some of the decisions made in this movie are so baffling it completely shatters the illusion of a coherent movie
Dec 24 2023,negative,i saw someone describe this as an rpg when you skip all the dialogue options and i feel like thats about the best description there could be theres no character development hell theres not really even any characters they hired some actors to immediately join the party without any personality or reason to care about them absolutely no depth at all the big betrayal doesnt matter because we havent gotten to know the characters enough for it to matter theres no chemistry between the characters so theres no emotion to it  the party is assembled on a bunch of planets were given no information about or reason to care about in a universe that short of some generic exposition we dont have any reason to care about  the action was poorly choreographed nonsense to the point the tiny steps people were taking running and awkward body posture when they knew things are going to be slowed down just looked ridiculous  the fights didnt flow and were the worst bad guy stands around and waits their turn possible  the story isnt just rushed its fractured and disjointed things just happen without any reason for them  i have no idea how this has as high rating as it does because this film is trash
Dec 24 2023,positive,the movie was phenomenal sick of the hit job that these so called critics especially on rt are pushing how about write an actual honest review and not a bought  paid for review amazing visuals and great performances see the film and stop the hate train band wagoning  cant wait for the directors cut as well as part ii hell the trailer alone was better than house of mouses disnification of the sws sequel trilogys oh and firejamesgunn
Dec 24 2023,positive,good scifi movie  effects are very well done  there does seem to be too much ground covered in one movie  climatic event seems a little rushed into to save the overall runtime
Dec 24 2023,negative,derivative poorly acted written and choreographed almost comical in its blatant thievery from better sources harry potter star wars firefly and more time ill never get back
Dec 24 2023,positive,this movie is marvelous well written magnificent visual effects and the story goes in a way in which you feel connected with each character kora is a character who shows you and let you see and feel the sorrow of being a child of war kora pain is well played by sofia boutella is a shame that all those critics hate this movie all of them have no honor respect and suffering from a lack of professionalism my advice is watch this movie and enjoy this new world the action is amazing the dialogs are deep and well written
Dec 24 2023,neutral,story was bland and unoriginal predictable in every aspect feels like scraps held together by thin pieces of tape casting was meh not a single character i was drawn to this is something you throw on just to have background noise
Dec 24 2023,neutral, beautiful visual   empty boring script   bad cast
Dec 24 2023,negative,it was a predictable you can tell it was written by politically left leaning people
Dec 24 2023,negative,its a really bad version of a bugs life crossed with serenity star wars dune and battle beyond the stars with a sprinkling of the magnificent seven the slow mo gets boring very quickly the dialogue is terrible the story is derivative there is zero humour it takes itself so seriously that its painful to watch all the way through its a series of really cool set pieces that look great in a trailer i really wanted this to be good it isnt
Dec 24 2023,negative,exposition intercut with low stakes action a good looking assortment of characters you dont care about or even like are thrust between unconnected action scenes with little drama    the use of the volume is woeful and obvious throughout     part 2 doesnt deserve to get finished
Dec 24 2023,positive,cast was great story is still building but so far has kept me heavily invested cant wait for the directors cut the movie needs to be longer and i am sure the directors cut will fill it in nicely lazy writing not really if you dont like 7 samurai in space you will most likely not find it appealing lazy commenters who complain about the script but cant proofread before sending 100
Dec 24 2023,positive,overall a good movie some cliches apart te worst thing to me is the skinny body of the most dangerous warrior she is a good actress but with the wrong shape for the role put someone like gina carano or lucy lawless and would be perfect for the role
Dec 24 2023,positive,a fresh and mature scifi movie thats gonna make you want to watch more cant wait for part 2
Dec 24 2023,positive,its for fans but if you are one not bad at all cant wait for part 2
Dec 24 2023,positive,as one who does not read comics or books i make no comparison in movies i like to be entertained and that is what this movie gave me good character development good story lines only complaint is movie was too short
Dec 24 2023,positive,ok so it does have the smell of other moviesseries in this genre but it does stand alone in the amazing cinematography its incredible the major sense i got in the beginning was firefly it just has that homestead come scifi feel mixed with some chronicles of rodrick and a pinch of dune it is a little slow in the beginning and i felt myself drifting a little also the bringing together of characters is slow my major issue though is that when it finally started to get going and you settle in it ends and as of writing this we have about five months until the next part comes out and by then it wont have the same impact but i would like to feel that a new thing is being created here i hope that this goes on to having its own universe with more depth to it being learned i wont spoil the story i just wanted to give a feel for it but definitely watch it i look forward to watching it again around when the next part comes out
Dec 24 2023,negative,zack is a good guy however he cannot write a story this movie is so bland all style over substance
Dec 24 2023,negative,completely unoriginal story  scpit writter   should be charged with plagiarism
Dec 24 2023,positive,pretty good movie was it the best no but definitely enjoyed it and looking forward to the 2nd part 810 rating would prefer a bit more depth on each main character but overall a good experience ignore the hater critics they are seriously jaded
Dec 24 2023,negative,this movie is terrible could be the worst movie ive ever seen stinky pile of poo
Dec 24 2023,negative,cringe acting  especially the protagonist ridiculous fight choreography really bad script and meh plot omg id rather watch paint dry
Dec 24 2023,negative,i want to like it it looks nice but none of it makes sense no cohesion like this review and the stilted acting from everyone but the villains made for a painful experience
Dec 24 2023,positive,great movie with fantastic action scenes a very good beginning for this new universe
Dec 24 2023,negative,oh dear stay away from this one nothing redeeming about it whatsoever
Dec 24 2023,negative,terrible moon the script was so shallow uninspiring and predictable there was nothing left to do but turn this film off i have seen more nuanced and interesting characters in childrens story books graphics were over engineered making the set and style feel more like a video game than a film do no watch spend your time better elsewhere
Dec 24 2023,negative,had potential but this movie is corny as heck   they way she goes to these people to recruit them she give some lame speech to the  convince them all to join her its lazy writing   especially the speech to make the general join them that was a terrible motivational speech   not enough character development moved way too fast
Dec 24 2023,positive,very entertaining and the effects were well done  a little slow in the middle but it picked up  i look forward to part 2
Dec 24 2023,positive,very good sci fi movie better than last star wars and star trek production but still guardians of galaxy on top
Dec 24 2023,negative,the saving grace for me was sophia boutella  the character she plays this film visually has so much potential but story wise is chaotic  very poorly edited again the only protagonist interesting is kora sophia boutella
Dec 24 2023,negative,in the running for worst movie of the decade spoilers  consistently nonsensical plot characters introduced early then forgotten until the end of the film recruit a general hes absent from all the planning recruit rebels immediately murdered see informant captured tell no on that their covers been blown  writing is equally amateurish 20 of the film is poorly written monologues from the protagonist she was named issa after an ancient queen issa the life giver it was said she could give life or a long monologue telling us about how she was adopted and raised to be a military officer followed by at the age of 18 i was made an officer and given a command obviously we just watched that happen over the entire monologue why are you also telling me this  the whole film is scenes and tropes lifted from other media and pasted into rebel moon 40k fake latin and fancy uniforms bad mos eisley cantina ripoff jason mimosa inspired gryphon taming scene from harry potter blades edge mts ripped from wow burning crusade  barf
Dec 24 2023,positive,the movie is awesome visually and i loved the characters this world has so much to offer and expand on looking forward to part 2 its a great scfi opera
Dec 24 2023,positive,good action and characters
Dec 24 2023,positive,not usually a fan of films like this but this was an amazing watch cant wait for the next part
Dec 24 2023,negative,i look forward to watch part 2  dune part 2
Dec 24 2023,negative,so bad like worst parody of star warspainful to watch
Dec 24 2023,positive,a tired plot with paperthin characters this is a film by numbers each required element being checked off a list its 3 stars only for the visuals do something better with 2 hours of your life
Dec 24 2023,positive,i enjoyed it as a first part and introduction to the characters and backstory looking forward to seeing where it goes for part 2
Dec 24 2023,positive,this is a good film who cares if it is similar to other movies it would be almost impossible for it not to i feel like it would have been better as a series though as it seems like there is not enough build up to have any empathy with the characters
Dec 24 2023,positive,visuals were stunning the story was quite interesting did feel a bit slow in places but i felt myself paying attention the entire time fight choreography was great too and felt real and you did notice the slow motion after a while    was an enjoyable movie and am looking forwards to the directors cut of this
Dec 24 2023,positive,i loved it very entertaining
Dec 24 2023,positive,this is why i dont ever listen to critics they know absolutely nothing and i have no idea how they got the job  this film was absolutely amazing best film ive seen in a long time better than any star wars and i love those films
Dec 24 2023,positive,very watchable think the directors cut will be better as r rated would suit this movie better otherwise enjoyed
Dec 24 2023,positive,absolutely brilliant film its star wars for adults and i cant wait for part 2
Dec 24 2023,negative,it is like star wars and warhammer 40k had a special needs child together
Dec 24 2023,positive,its a fun movie with some great cinematographyits not a ground breaking story line as it borrows from other movies but most good movies do looking forward to the second part
Dec 24 2023,positive,is a great movie with very amazing visuals characters are so cool made cgi at its best the movie has nothing to do with star wars the story is really good and is opening door to more parts only hating people will say is not a good movie  i will definitely look forward to upcoming parts
Dec 24 2023,positive,its a beatiful scifi epos is it inovative no so what still great loved every second of it
Dec 24 2023,negative,the was so much over use of slow motion that i thought my brain could suddenly slow time cgi looked like a late 90s fox television series
Dec 24 2023,negative,this movie is a hybrid between a comedy and a scifi trolling movie  the way the movie is put together it seems like a 4yearold trying to copy the classics in a dumb way stuff like star wars 7 samurai iron sky and copying parts of lore of videogames in an awful and tasteless way  how people can appreciate this stuff is beyond me i was able to go through the movie because the big budget gave some almost decent action scenes and some good actors
Dec 24 2023,positive,visuals outstanding storyline was lacking choppy and no character development
Dec 24 2023,positive,loved it   fun good entertainment really well done visuals waiting for the next installment
Dec 24 2023,negative,yes it really is that bad even before you get to the story character development etc you have to deal with out of focus scenes and patches of cgi that only just surpass ant man of a family of 4 that included a fresh out of uni film director 3 of us were on our phones in less than 30 mins and the 4 unconscious
Dec 24 2023,positive,aside from some of the slow action sequences the movie was pretty good looking forward to seeing part two
Dec 24 2023,positive,i really liked it from the moment it started i was wrapped up in it i cant wait for the next part definitely a must watch and am telling all the people i know its definitely worth a watch
Dec 24 2023,negative,essentially a hard to follow clip show  nothing in the plot to make you care about any of the characters although the main heroine might be worth fleshing out
Dec 24 2023,negative,hilariously bad the dialogue is cringeworthy full of boring poorly acted humourless monologues even the action sequences are in slow motion like some 90s student movie  the visuals are however very impressive on the whole its just a shame they dont wrap themselves around a better movie  all in all we had a lot of fun laughing at how bad it all was but seriously they spent 170 million dollars on this and thats actually not funny
Dec 24 2023,negative,arguments are a little childish you will not find original ideas in this movie its a mix of seven samurai star wars and any western movie    graphics are ok but not enough to justify the script
Dec 24 2023,positive,instead of a single 2 hour movie it should have been a 3 episoderegarding the story its great  uplifting amazing choreography vfx action  on point slomos  the story is too good to be that short felt like scenes were cut which definitely were
Dec 24 2023,positive,pulp sifi with cliches and underdeveloped characters but certainly not the disaster some would have you believe several things ive not seen before i look forward to part 2 as a kid i used to wander down the sifi aisle in bookstores marveling at the fantastic cover art rebel moon brings them to life
Dec 24 2023,negative,mom can we have 40k    no we have 40k at home    this like ordering epic space movie from wish
Dec 24 2023,positive,akira kurosawas 7 samurai meets star wars  awesome movie cant wait for the r rated version and part 2
Dec 24 2023,positive,its not so bad as some people want to make it out to be i appreciate the effort to make a new ipthat said slowmo is excessive and in most cases unnecessary cgi is inconsistent fight choreography should significantly improve character development is minimaltonone and characters dont have chemistryleading to me not feeling for them when they get killed off main character is bland at best antagonists are far more interesting it needed to be rated r to get the best out of it unfortunately its held back by the pg13 rating that makes it convoluted in the editing room    id watch the entire series but it missed the mark in terms of being a new classic
Dec 24 2023,positive,zack definitely delivers on epic fight scenes some good visuals and strong characters but the world building is a little lack luster
Dec 24 2023,positive,very entertaining and i really like the narrative of the story cant wait for part 2
Dec 24 2023,negative,an attempt at grandiosity that rang unfortunately hollow
Dec 24 2023,positive,i really love movie something new to watch kora  the action is fun to me if gave it 5 stars  like the story
Dec 24 2023,positive,absolutely brilliant  great direction and awesome story  cant wait for part 2
Dec 24 2023,positive,yes it has been inspired by many other movies but what movie hasnt just because there are tropes doesnt mean its trite or hodgepodge i judge movies by an emotional connection and it had that for me the cast is insanely all hot but also not in the cw way actually interesting and good acting highly recommend for fans of this genre
Dec 24 2023,negative,rather than pay the rights to use an existing ip the writers of this film and the visual effects people borrow chunks from others from judge dredds 90s movie lawgiver to the space dreadnought from homeworld 2 game to the style and language of the bad guys of the imperial guard w40k and story from numerous movies and particular another space movie battle beyond the stars which had more originality and humour i wont even go into the dodgy accents are english actors still allowed to do irish and are we still doing the obvious evil empire as british
Dec 24 2023,negative,an unnecessary show of visual gymnastics really
Dec 24 2023,positive,nowhere near a starwars rip off so good i cant wait for the story to continue
Dec 24 2023,positive,rebel moon continues zack snyders exploration of the heroes journey as expected it is a visual feast the storyline is relatively straightforward with a few surprises that appear along the way i look forward to re watching this excellent film
Dec 24 2023,positive,i lovedddd the movie i dont understand why people are criticizing it my opinion is that this movie was phenomenal it had me anxious and pumped the whole time waiting for second part
Dec 24 2023,negative,incoherent star wars ripoff  id like the time i wasted watching it back
Dec 24 2023,positive,i loved it but we needed more backgroundpossibly in the directors cut  i found over 2 hours passed like 15 minutes really looking forward to the next part    reading the professional critics reviews i wonder who these people are  they get paid for writing guff
Dec 24 2023,negative,it reminded me of the b movies that followed star wars that wanted to be the new star wars but fell short
Dec 24 2023,positive,whats with the negative reviews this movie was completely entertaining and production gold it feels unfinished because it is unfinished 
Dec 24 2023,positive,beautiful cinematography special effects story characters universe environments just an epic movie masterpiece
Dec 24 2023,positive,who cares if it resembles star wars this was a banger visually stunning and action packed great fight choreography soundtrack and special effects top ensemble with badass names tarak devra bloodaxe general titus costumes and makeup on point loved it
Dec 24 2023,negative,unlikable characters hasty and disconnected narration an embarrassing film
Dec 24 2023,positive,movie was super entertaining we really enjoyed it
Dec 24 2023,negative,whats worse than a movie that shamelessly plagiarizes elements from other scifi or fantasy products a movie that does all this and fails to even build a world in which you feel interest and curiosity in finding out how the story will evolve however if the terrible worldbuilding is rebel moons biggest flaw it certainly cannot be said that everything else is able to compensate for the extremely poor script direction visual effects photography costumes are all so aseptic and unmemorable that it is guaranteed that nothing of this movie will remain forged in peoples minds for years to come as movies and tv series have been able to do like which rebel moon would pretentiously love to place itself
Dec 24 2023,negative,a movie with forgettable characters boring dialogue no pacing mediocre sfx more lens flare than a jj abrams  i switched the film off after 97 minutes as i had lost the will to live
Dec 24 2023,positive,my thoughts on rebel moon  1 whoever said its slow and has no character arch should visit their therapists asap  2 2 hours are not enough and might lack in proper editing  3 sofia is a powerhouse  4 directions cut will be the brilliant r rated version we are all eating for
Dec 24 2023,negative,a compelling setting with great visuals squandered by a cast of paperthin characters and a soulless story this movie attempts the classic seven samurai formula but fails to create compelling and likable characters the film casts character development and plot cohesion aside to squeeze in as much action as possible which might be a plus for some    if you are looking for a mindless action film that allows you to turn your brain off and marvel at the gorgeous setpieces and action sequences you will enjoy this film if you are looking for a compelling narrative with a cast of lovable characters you would be better off searching elsewhere
Dec 24 2023,positive,this has everything a new story line a new universe to get your teeth stuck into characters to care about visually it is stunning to watch and the time flew in watching it cant wait for the extended version to see more
Dec 24 2023,positive,by far one of the best most enjoyable and entertaining scifi movies i have seen in years cant wait to see the extended uncensored cut and the second part i loved it
Dec 24 2023,positive,great movie i think am gonna have to rewatch it all over again
Dec 24 2023,positive,zack snyders rebel moon  part one a child of fire an action packed seven samurai x spaghetti west space adventure movie
Dec 24 2023,negative,it felt like a mediocre console game the team recruiting streamlined objectives with no parallel plots etc made me feel like i was watching a playthrough at some point i was searching for a compiled list of stolen cliches from other franchises as they were so many the visuals were decent thought ill give it that
Dec 24 2023,positive,long awaited zack snyders new universe doesnt disappoint loved it from the beginning til the very end shouldve been r rated cut right away but hey im still happy
Dec 24 2023,negative,i really wanted to like it but it was so disjointed that it was in many sections almost nonsensical  it was clear they knew they were doing a directors cut and so when they edited down this release it was not with an eye towards making it a coherent story   dont bother watching this version   wait for the extended addition and then decide if youll watch the sequel
Dec 24 2023,negative,possibly the most derivative and unoriginal sci fi movie ever manages to rip off star wars dune avatar and harry potter all in one movie  in that regards i guess it is quite a accomplishment
Dec 24 2023,positive,i liked the idea even though clearly picks from many other moviesand the visuals i think there is a lot of potential here but to be honest he felt a bit rush in the finale overal i liked it and looking forward to the second part
Dec 24 2023,negative,slow over done slow motion scenes no character building and  over hyped feels like a waste of time only thing good in the whole thing was the griffin scene everything else flop in my opinion maybe if done as a series to allow more character development and story itd been fine wont be watching part 2
Dec 24 2023,positive,this movie is amazing very captivating from beginning to the end the story is so good action and visuals are beautiful would definitely recommend everyone to watch it and experience it
Dec 24 2023,positive,its not a masterpiece it doesnt have to be it entertains you for 2 hours and despite all the rubbish ive seen in the cinema this year ive been merciful here
Dec 24 2023,positive,this was an interesting movie things meets clash of titans meets avatar nice world building a little rushed but exciting and interesting plot
Dec 24 2023,positive,a promising start to a new universe   really enjoyed the world building and various people and places saw along the way i think its perfectly set up for an epic part 2 that will be the heart wrenching scifi war ive only ever dreamed of
Dec 24 2023,positive,the acting was good and great visuals it borrows a lot from other scifi movies star wars in particular however it was entertaining and worth watching dont know why it has so many negative reviews looking forward to part 2
Dec 24 2023,positive,this movie is entertaining from start to finish this movie is scifi fantasy  the viewer expects to have some things left unexplained that ok we know its make believe we dont need a narrator to explain everything
Dec 24 2023,negative,the story has no soul its rushed and just another bloated cgi mess
Dec 24 2023,negative,wow what a bad cheap version of star wars people who loved it aredelusional it was awful cgi fest empty dialogs event that advance the plot because they are needed not because it makes sense what a waste of time
Dec 24 2023,positive,simple story lots of details great visuals first part feels like something was accomplished wanted to see more of ray fishers character evil bad guy seems questionable loved fighting scenes
Dec 24 2023,positive,you know im a fan of many movies and many directors but most of all im a fan of good stories and good characters  this has both  sure there are some issues with battle scene slow motion which personally i think can detract from the chaos and intensity of battle but its a minor niggle if the story works its also refreshing to have a story not beset by a big studio message or pandering to be relevant in todays society and just being a story  its a traditional story about empire stomping on those that it claims to protect the things that real world rebellions have been caused by but its an enjoyable ride along with a band of characters and protagonists that left me wanting to see a the next chapter and b the extended rrated version
Dec 24 2023,positive,enjoyed this quite a bit and im excited to see what part 2 has to offer also visually stunning film
Dec 24 2023,positive,zack snider does it again   this movie was amazing i normally dont watch gritty scifi but i always want to give zack a look expecting the movie to be okay but i was surprised how engrossing the story is the characters the visuals and the settings top notch and the villain is one of the most scary and gross villains i had seen on a while the choice of weapon a blunt object makes him more sadistic and guttural very fresh way to present a villain in these sanitized times cant wait for the directors cut and the sequel
Dec 24 2023,positive,i went into this blind about what it was and worried id roll my eyes into oblivion at the thought of a rip off star wars but was pleasantly surprised at the visuals the plot and the characters overall i really enjoyed it
Dec 24 2023,negative,the script is ancient like a dinosaur era movie
Dec 24 2023,positive,loved it cant wait for part 2
Dec 24 2023,positive,this movie is amazing
Dec 24 2023,positive,story was super basic we all have seen it before a mix of blade runner star wars harry potter and dune cgi was too much and the slow motion was done way too frequently no way this movie needed 2 parts
Dec 24 2023,negative,the movie has several references tries to be something ends up being nothing
Dec 24 2023,negative,i had to sign up and post for the first time on rotten tomatoes just to express how bad this movie is i had only moderate hopes but there just isnt anything redeemable about this movie
Dec 24 2023,positive,personally i dont think this movie shouldve been split into 2 movies or at least the editing could be better  just from watching the preview of the of part 2 i get what i was missing from part 1 back story      all and all enjoyable watch  descent action and great cinematography  dialogue couldve used some work i dont get people bashing on the tropes and retelling of seven samurai  everything has been done and most stories are told we have tropes for a a reason i thought it was a fresh take on the story that being said it was just cut and edited all wrong  maybe the rated r cut will be better
Dec 24 2023,negative,this was too rushed would have been better as a tv series where each character was fleshed our considering how dynamic they are  great cast but poorly executed
Dec 24 2023,positive,absolutely snyders best work to date a must see
Dec 24 2023,positive,its an ok action fantasy movie  nothing groundbreaking for the story line so far seven samurai based  some of the character development scenes seemed excessive or just filler but maybe there is some payoff in part 2  the character story im most interested to see if anything develops is actually the droid
Dec 24 2023,positive,pretty awesome movie watched it with my partner and we both loved it she loved the aliens and i loved the subtle star wars hints of what couldve been
Dec 24 2023,positive,i enoyed the show great visuals the story is good enough to keep my interest looking foward to the extented version and to part 2
Dec 24 2023,negative,theres only one way to describe it dull
Dec 24 2023,negative,how did this even get made theres so much wrong its not even possible to enumerate it here is it sci fi is it fantasy who knows worse who cares
Dec 24 2023,negative,please do not waste your time watching this film the plot is horrible the acting is atrocious and its basically a rip off of every scifi movie there ever was  there were even orcs and hypogriffs i wanted this to be so much better than it was
Dec 24 2023,positive,if you are a fan of sci fi movies this is a must
Dec 24 2023,positive,it was a wonderful story with wonderful characters and actors  visually  it was very strickling and i look forward to the second part i dont believe the critics gave it a fair review
Dec 24 2023,positive,this movie is as expected    it is good  it felt quick    its part one and it plays like a part one   you want to watch part 2 when its over   its like good star wars
Dec 24 2023,positive,visually impressive and generally entertaining there was potential for this movie to be one of the best science fiction movies in a long time it started strong and had compelling characters but then it all started to feel rushed new characters were introduced like we already knew their backstoryand were immediately trusted by the protagonists without question there is an overwhelming star wars theme throughoutfrom the villain emerging from near death to bar scenes and the hero rising from a modest farming community what saves this movie is the visuals action sequences and there is nothing that is noticeably terrible like dialogue or massive plot holes it definitely would have benefited from pacing character development and a longer runtime they should made this into a limited series
Dec 24 2023,positive,excellent fantasy and sci fi flick if youre looking for dramatic acting in the sense of opemhiemer this aint it but if you want an escape from reality and a couple hours with sheer visual and conceptual delight this meets all those points thank you zach for not making movies for critics and in turn giving your fans something to delight in   one more thing ill never watch movies because some stuffy nose that thinks they know better tells me what is enjoyable
Dec 24 2023,negative,the   storyline reminding me too much of an old show called battle beyond the stars the special effects were actually pretty lame and acting really was flat it was really a big disappointment i will not be wasting my time watching the next episode when it comes out later this year
Dec 24 2023,positive,great film     need more films of warriors showcasing their abilities and fight scenes
Dec 24 2023,positive,stunning visuals new interesting worlds and characters to explore excited to see part 2
Dec 24 2023,negative,an overwrought but mildly entertaining mashup of seven samurai and every wornout scifi trope imaginable nothing new to see here
Dec 24 2023,negative,one of the worst scifi movies i have ever seen the entire story is disjointed and fails on so many levels it is like bad star wars fan fiction if the fan had never watched star wars and confused star wars with star trek but wanted to make a space opera with lots of slo mo parts of battle sequences
Dec 24 2023,positive,loved every minute it yes there are elements of star wars dune and others but in this day and age the basic plots of all movies are the same the story fits well into the classic heroes journey
Dec 24 2023,negative,ive seen and enjoyed a lot of bad scifi movies but the only enjoyable thing about this movie is the costume and set design the heavily used cgi is okay i guess its at least passable all the excitement of the action scene is snuffed out by over used slow motion the acting is wooden and you can easily forget characters in the main crew worst of all the movie is just predictable and boring with what characters you barely remember being moved along by the plot i would say the movie is all edge no point but theres not even an edge to the movie
Dec 24 2023,positive,fantastic movie i dont understand all the hate to be honest
Dec 24 2023,positive,i liked everything about it  it had me hooked from start to finish action packed i am looking forward to part two of this movie  the critics go it wrong
Dec 24 2023,positive,an world and story full of potential but intrigue is lost when the it started to feel formulaic the start of the film had me interested in the world and kora the main character but as she goes on a venture to recruit an army it turns into a predictable structure of land on planet observe a character overcome a great feat and have them join the crew for no convincing reason this would have been a better format if done as a series with 810 episodes if each episode could have been spent on a planet exploring the lore culture races and laws of that world and making us care about the character thats eventually recruited it would have been way more impactful by the end of the season but rather when the big fight happens at the end of the film i had little to no investment into the characters at times i couldnt even recall their names therefore i have no reason to care who lives or dies i just simply watched it feeling next to nothing  it had good graphics but while the battle scenes look nice they cut into slow motion so often and at times that felt unneeded that it made the battles feel too long it also fell into the same trap that we see in action movies where no one despite being trained soldiers can aim their guns properly or hit their targets if their lives depended on it and yes their lives did depend on it of course our main character and her crew had exceedingly good luck with their aim s  thankfully the ending of the film left me intrigued and wanting to tune in for part 2 if only the middle of the film was as strong as the start and end it would be near perfect unfortunately the thought of sitting through this film a second time is not a thought ill be having anytime soon
Dec 24 2023,negative,by zach snyderok decent visuals but has struggles trying to determine if its a cheap star wars knock off with a mix match of viking western pirates nazis genres all jumbled together oh and a supreme emporer  like i said decent visuals but not sure i waste time eagerly awaiting part 2  
Dec 24 2023,negative,this movie is such a waste of talent the definition of cliché with cero tensión in every scene
Dec 24 2023,positive,good movie overall  visuals were incredible as usual zack never misses
Dec 24 2023,negative,wow that dragged in so many places  has no one talked to them about pacing  waste of potential that cast deserves better what a slog  thankful for the fast forward button
Dec 24 2023,positive,it was entertaining interesting and fun looking at some of the reviewer scores and comments reminded me of the simpons episode where homer writes scathing restaurant reviews if you like this genre then definitely give if a watch if not then you wont enjoy it regardless that said i dont believe reviewer scores accurately reflect anything these days and youre better off giving it a go yourself or asking someone with similar taste in movies for their opinion
Dec 24 2023,negative,reminds me of a made for tv movie i dont think its supposed to be a comedy but all i did was laugh at everything  its not even interesting i just wanted all the characters to die lol
Dec 24 2023,positive,i dunno what everyone is bitching about i had fun 
Dec 24 2023,positive,good dose of sci fi action
Dec 24 2023,positive,first of all as usual when the critics dislike a movie i want to watch it rebel moon was awesome  i have noticed since the trump era when one critic dislikes a movie the rest of the critics pile on like vultures to say rebel moon is spoof of star wars then star wars and every other scifi is a spoof of star trek
Dec 24 2023,neutral,derivative and a bit hokey reminded me of 1980 flash gordon but less fun good guy takes out a space ship with a spear lol
Dec 24 2023,positive,it was a really good movie give it a watch idk what these critics are talking about it captivated my attention like i stopped eating my sandwich at certain scenes cause i was that hooked
Dec 24 2023,positive,poetry in motion a must see for everyone and definitely the best christmas present
Dec 24 2023,positive,i dont understand all the hate i think it was very good it has one job to tell an entertaining story it accomplished this job and fairly well it truly did the acting was fabulous the sets were very well done production value was high bonus it was also free yes the story is not particularly original but what story is  the good versus evil plot is an ancient one retold many times kudos not codemnation are in order if you notice it was the critics who rated it so low the audience seems to rate it at almost a 70  i am always suspicious of those who do not  create anything yet judge those who do with vitriol smh
Dec 24 2023,positive,is it cheesy definitely some parts are a little rough and theres definitely a requirement for suspension of disbelief soooo many storylines that felt shorter than they couldve been but i wanted more special effects were very very fun thoroughly enjoyable looking forward to part 2
Dec 24 2023,positive,far from perfect  but also refreshing fun in many ways
Dec 24 2023,negative,had potential  visually its beautiful but it lacks depth the characters are 2dreally dont like them they lack almost any redeemable qualities  and really annoyed at them waiting to have the rated r versionso stupid
Dec 24 2023,positive,some characters dont really get fleshed out enough and the pacing can be a little jumpy at times but rebel moon builds an incredible universe with complex motivations for its core cast satisfying action sequences and does a good job of resolving its own conflict while building towards part 2 very enjoyable watch
Dec 24 2023,positive,great movie only wish we had the rrated version at launch the only sad thing is its too short i really wish we had the uncut 3h version right away to see the full lenght in details of this movie     overall a great experience the cast is great and deliver a great performance the pacing is great were toss into the thick of the movie within minutes     a great space opera
Dec 24 2023,negative,very paint by numbers story that cant decide if it wants to be star wars or dune  foreshadowing is non existant and a quick speech is all it takes to get people to join her crew   no character development and too much slo motion  skip this one  watch it if you dont like bright colours cause there is so much brown
Dec 24 2023,positive,there were story elements i recognised for sure its a scifi hero movie with a pretty big nod to seven samuraimagnificent seven and various other franchises but so what  the fx were well done the fight scenes had a riddick vibe the whole slomo thing the score was epic if a bit light on themes some of the dialog was a bit obvious  but as a world builder leaving questions as it should pretty good  so in the grander scheme of things did i enjoy it yes  am i looking forward to the next part did i finish this one wanting to see more  100 yes
Dec 24 2023,positive,our family loved it we cant wait for part 2
Dec 24 2023,negative,out of focus unoriginal unwatchable dull muddy visuals  the slomo all the slomo she even drops the grain in slomo i couldnt tell if the writerdirector needed ritalin or if hed odd on it
Dec 24 2023,positive,great visuals  stunning world
Dec 24 2023,negative,this is a rip off of other movies of course starwarsdunematrixbladerunnerjudge dredd and 300 but i guess 300 doesnt count very hokeypredictable and porn has a better dialogue too much spent on fx and not on writing except for the ships they just looked stupid dont waste 2 hours of your time
Dec 24 2023,negative,absolute garbage i couldnt finish it not could my daughter a lot younger than me a complete unoriginal ripoff of countless other movies dont waste your time
Dec 24 2023,positive,good action movie with a straight forward empire vs underdog story  the rag tag group of protagonists is a good mix of a hero the forgotten the lost and the rebels i see a lot of bad scores but i give it an 85 it wasnt empire strikes back but it sure as hell wasnt waterworld either  lol 
Dec 24 2023,positive,a straight forward movie and keep me glue to the screen entire duration cant wait for part 2
Dec 24 2023,positive,this movie gives a different aspect of a star wars trilogy more violence and an indepth view of each character i enjoyed every turning moment id say a dune meets star wars with a very strong passionate leading lady fantastic cgi and the characters are very interesting i loved every pulse pounding moment all you die hard star wars fans get into a new generation away from that trilogy not a rip off a rip forward  rotten tomatoes doesnt do this movie justice i loved it and i want more
Dec 24 2023,positive,kind of like seven samurai of the stars its watchable enough
Dec 24 2023,negative,mediocre bigscale nonsense delivered with laughable amount of slowmo and corny dialogues thankfully we have star wars from george lucas
Dec 24 2023,negative,not derivative just downright plagiaristic visually exhausting yet boring
Dec 24 2023,positive,i didnt know the history of this movie  i just happened to see it trending and watched   the visuals are outstanding and choreography of fights was good   i like the and of misfits with no hope idea focusing on each heroes story   the acting was good and the story has me wanting to see the sequel
Dec 24 2023,positive,i have no clue what the so called professional critics are smoking this movie is perfection absolute must watch cant wait for director cut
Dec 24 2023,positive,predictable and cliched but enjoyable wish there was better character development but that would have made part 1 too slow looking forward to part 2
Dec 24 2023,positive,spectacular cinematography and one of the best villains to hit the screen in a long time cant wait for more
Dec 24 2023,positive,really liked the whole cast  cept ed strein becoming a big fan of sophia also looking forward to dir cut
Dec 24 2023,negative,its pretty to look at but its not very good
Dec 24 2023,negative,the time spent on totally unnecessary slowmo would have been better used developing the characters it feels like a huge waste of big potential at every corner you get the feeling of a rich and interesting world only to be fed cliches and a predictable story with some major plot holes
Dec 24 2023,negative,it was almost better than the flash
Dec 24 2023,negative,i dont mind cliché so long as its still a compelling overall story this film borders on unwatchable due to its paint by numbers script
Dec 24 2023,positive,really deserves 4 stars but people seem to get off on hating this movie so tried to counter that with a 5 star its enjoyable looks pretty and makes me want to see part ii its not groundbreaking but it doesnt need to be sometimes its ok for a movie to just be enjoyable
Dec 24 2023,positive,its a fine movie  not horrible not great  you can watch it and not be angry you watched it  the characters werent set up very well couldnt care if they loved or died
Dec 24 2023,positive,i think the reviews are overly harsh i enjoyed this movie and hope to see part 2
Dec 24 2023,negative,the movie is long with very little character development while visually pretty at times they dont stay in any one place long enough for you to really explore the area the dialogue is laughable with one scene in particular the main character is trying to convince another person to join her team and the things she says are so bad i began laughing out loud as she spoke the lines it is a straight up remake of the seven samurai im not sure where the articles claiming its an original story get that idea from in seven samurai you have japanese farmers searching for samurai to defend their village from raiders stealing their rice in rebel moon you have space farmers searching for space warriors to defend their village from an empirial admiral stealing their wheat
Dec 24 2023,negative,what did i just watch hollywood directors need to go train in japan and learn how to create good films again the plot was boring and predictable the acting was sub par they really wasted the talent they had and the main character was just horrible just about everyone else in the film was more believable than her and had a better story arc very poorly executed project
Dec 24 2023,negative,this movie was kind of a mess the plot was paper thin which i mean is fine for a b sci fi flick but it was so choppy from the outset it didnt flow at all we start on a farm where we have our hero and possibly two unlikely allies that never show up again for whatever reason but were made to seem important yes im aware theres more parts but at least make it make sense the giant exposition dumps from our main heroin were bad go into the recruitment phase for this little adventure and it just felt like it just jumped from one planet to the next without truly fleshing out any of the characters for real so you didnt actually care why they were joining this crew the abilities they had to aid in this rebellion didnt really make any sense we had a farmer a grifter a wannabe anime female assassin type a retired drunken general and some random barbarian types because why not if i missed anyone else it was because they were just that forgettable all of the fight sequences save for one in the bar were awful typical stormtrooper fodder minus the fun the sad part is i found the background characters that had like one scene infinitely more interesting than the main cast a lot of slow mo when it wasnt necessary in fact in the final fight the slow motion made this big hero moment  of one of the characters look like he was straight out of team america world police that actually got a laugh out of me tldr it was a mess the characters sucked and if i didnt know that it was taking itself seriously i would have thought it was a parody
Dec 24 2023,negative,ive never written a movie review  i had thought about writing a movie and now i think i definitely can just do a bunch of drugs watch as much animefantasy and scifi as possible and maybe not sleep you will have rebel moon characters from gladiator to mad max fury road toss in a few light sabers spider people and hobbitsorcs wtv tf also i cannot believe this movie was produced without any production company or studio suing the producers or whomever  i have seen it once and do not plan to ever again i felt like there was a hidden prize you would win if you could guess every movie tv show or anime they ripped off if there is please let me know unfortunately i will still have to watch part 2 to laugh at all the other sh they copied
Dec 24 2023,positive,great movie would love to get an extensive series if possible
Dec 24 2023,positive,its a fun movie lot of actions and cinematography was great excited for part ii
Dec 24 2023,negative,a series of beautiful images barely strung together with a nonsensical plot this self indulgent film feels like a poorly written video game from 2009
Dec 24 2023,positive,good movie the experts  critics are wrong again
Dec 24 2023,positive,it was a fun action packed movie
Dec 24 2023,negative,a rough movie to watch no thank you on part 2
Dec 24 2023,positive,could have been better pretty much a retelling of the seven samaris
Dec 24 2023,negative,overall the film is probably not bad from the category that you watched once with mixed feelings you either regret wasted time or not but in any case there will definitely be no desire to review this film for the next 70 years  people didnt bother with the script at all later i looked at what the scriptwriters had created earlier and realized that for their level this was normal but its not clear how zach got there i hope by mistake the interest in the plot is about the same as in the first mario brothers game on the third playthrough  everything is linear without any developments in the narrative you can start watching from the middle of the film and nothing will change at all
Dec 24 2023,positive,i was immersed into the story line immediately wonderful cinematography and music   incredible sci fi fantasy one of the best ive seen in a long time  must see 
Dec 24 2023,negative,a sad reskinning of other movies its like he took script pages from other scifi and fantasy films and randomly threw them together about the only nonboring joy the movie can bring is guessing which movie hes stealing which scene from oh thats a new hope followed by harry potter meets how to train your dragon even a dose of the original frakenstien but everything is simply stolen from something else
Dec 24 2023,negative,my family and i loved playing the game where we guessed where each part of the movie was stolen from which other franchises omg this movie was so bad i understand you have to suspend some disbelief but this was asking me to be almost mentally deficient to follow along the dialogue seems to have been written by chat gpt the female lead was a complete mary sue and ive seen better acting in middle school plays i will schedule my future lobotomy before watching part 2
Dec 24 2023,positive,very good movie  i could definitely see this in the sw universe high attention to detail very good acting special effects   good story line along 7 samurai  excited for party 2
Dec 24 2023,negative,super hero femme fatal dodges 10000 lasers kills everyone in over used slow mo in this perverse for no reason poorly written dleauge warhammer want to be
Dec 24 2023,positive,i iiked the movie   its perhaps misunderstood by most critics as some kind of drama so theyve reviewed it as such  its not though its a sci fi action movie  the action is great the weapons and cybernetics and combat choreography are really well made  explosions are cool  the acting is good what there is of it the story is adequate for what its supposed to be for the genre
Dec 24 2023,positive,love the movie it definitely borrows a lot from other scifi movies out there but you already know that i love the storyline used does a very good job of keeping my interest  definitely recomend
Dec 24 2023,positive,it was not bad as the critics say cant wait for part 2
Dec 24 2023,negative,this movie feels like its been written by an 8 year old no substance incredibly dumb characters at least in 300 the action varanted slow motion here every little thing is in slow motion people get stabbed left and right yet there is no blood the pg13 rating is little silly with this amount of fighting and people dying left and right
Dec 24 2023,neutral,id never heard of this movie so i went in with low expectations  it still disappointed  poor clichéd script mediocre acting and large budget special effects  the constant oration kills the pacing and makes the movie drag  id probably be happy to find this on the sci fi network at 1 am
Dec 24 2023,positive,i really enjoyed these movie in fact i enjoyed it enough i came here to leave a review which i never do it does have some violence but it felt ok for my 13 year old 
Dec 24 2023,positive,great visuals a bit more of character development would have been nice but of course theres limitations to movies as opposed to series a strong start for a new saga
Dec 24 2023,negative,there are fun moments but so many things that just take you out of the story this movie is loaded with great actors but due to there being such a massive cast you dont really get attached to anyone they try to give some back story as they assemble the team but it feels very forced i also hope you like slow motion because we sure know zach does any kind of action scene there will be a multiple slow motion cuts  while yes these are cool and he does a great job there are so many it just gets old its like being forced to eat cake at every meal its great at first but starts to quickly loose its appeal there isnt a glaring horrible thing its a fun scifi movie and it is what its meant to bebut they try to layer so many things into the movie you just dont find it particularly interesting
Dec 24 2023,positive,i thought the movie was good it held my attention i felt the characters were compelling as was the story admiral noble is quite the villan artheliuskora is a strong protaganist the movie reminds me of putin vs ukraine
Dec 24 2023,positive,good overall moviedecent script with great cinematography my only real complaint is that it is 1 of only 2 partsshould be a limited series to flesh out the characters a bit more
Dec 24 2023,negative,it tries too much to be epic at every scene and dialogue get cheesy and boring
Dec 24 2023,positive,entertaining the scene were epiccant wait for the directors cutat least the bad guys can shoot not like stormtroopers  refreshing after ep8 and 9 dissapointment  cant wait for part 2
Dec 24 2023,positive,good movie decent pace storyline could have been a little more r rated otherwise its okay
Dec 24 2023,negative,this is tragedy unnecessary and overused slow motion  the script dialogue seems to be written by a child and the acting compliments that snyders lack of clear vision showed through the characters bouncing back and forth between western viking  and irish accentscustoms the lead is suppose to be a battle hardened badass but she looks scared and indecisive the entire time the big bad villain imperial is poorly explained and the flashbacks are more awkward than insightful lastly the fight scenes lets just say sandra bullock and melissa mccarthy in the heat fight scenes are better and more believable
Dec 24 2023,negative,no plot no character development too many slow motion shots very average vfx no thanks
Dec 24 2023,positive,fun movie excited for the next one
Dec 24 2023,negative,while rebel moon borrows from a lot of scifi tropes it really failed to deliver a compelling and riveting story visually this movie is a wonder to see and it has that warhammer 40k aesthetics to it however the execution of the story ruins it by giving us characters with no personalities and makes us believe that they would easily band together with very little effort it is unfortunate that this movie will heavily rely on the next chapter in order for it to be considered whole most movie series that are considered to be top tier have held their own with each movie each movie should have its own separate arc that will culminate at the conclusion sadly for this movie it will rely on the next installment scargiver for it to be considered digestible     the good visually amazing and i really love the concept    the bad execution of the movie is lackluster the pacing is terrible and the characters not interesting enough    the ugly overuse of slow motion not every action sequence needs a slow motion for the love of god zack stop it
Dec 24 2023,positive,absolutely a blast i am baffled by the disconnect between the critics and the actual people
Dec 24 2023,positive,i dont even know why people pay attention to critic reviews anymore yes while you get star war vibes the concept was cool graphics were fun and the story is dramatic yet entertaining  what happened to just enjoying a good movie with family everything is oh they didnt do this or i expected that it wasnt trash it was creative and most films nowadays arent as original is they use to be but that doesnt mean you cant just smile while watching if you want to write and create a script and see if it can make a movie go for it so be lighthearted on the reviews lol especially hardcore critics
Dec 24 2023,positive,perfect amount of scifi and action no corny love story but would have enjoyed a little of chemistry or romance some type vibes the chronicles of riddick mixed with star wars chefs kiss
Dec 24 2023,negative,its beautiful the design the scenes the costumes theres little characterization for characters we are supposed to expect the acting isnt great the plot is very simple and i had little to no care about it i just wished it was better feels like its all been done before and done better beautiful but no substance
Dec 24 2023,negative,boring and filled with tropes youve seen a million times before the lead heros planet was wiped out by the big baddie who then adopted her and she became a great warrior who will turn on him sound familiar action is horrible slowmo adds nothing to this film but director uses it more than lens flare in the rebooted star trek
Dec 24 2023,positive,excellent storyline i eagerly am looking forward to part to and others
Dec 24 2023,positive,its rushed and doesnt have much time to breathe but it got me interested in this universe and im definitely planning to check out the rrated cut
Dec 24 2023,positive,i liked it  a good b movie space epic with some great action scenes  most of cast is great however disappointed in treatment of ray fisher and charlie hunmans characters and corey stoll wasted  special mention to anthony hopkins  film owes a lot to star wars and even some doctor who however opening scene brought to my mind gone with the wind and if youre seen both youll know what  i mean  i look forward to part 2
Dec 24 2023,positive,the film is incredible i liked the setting actors acting scenery costumes and photography excellent film
Dec 24 2023,negative,this movie is basically 7 samurai but set in space i was looking forward to this movie but it just didnt live up to the hype the plot armor the heroes have along with the low tier acting not even its amazing visuals can redeem this
Dec 24 2023,negative,i dont know what this is but it is not good
Dec 24 2023,positive,good movie and it leads to even better movies in the future
Dec 24 2023,positive,very solid  zach delivers a damn good film
Dec 24 2023,neutral,it had good action scenes but no real plot id like them to develop the characters more also they should have released parts 1 and 2 at the same time it might make a difference on how its rated
Dec 24 2023,negative,absolutely horrible in every sense of the word
Dec 24 2023,positive,there is no denying that the film is derivative but i disagree with reviewers who say it is only derivative of star wars dune or other large scifi franchises i think it is mostly derivative of samurai films and retellings of the seven samuraimagnificent seven set in space if you have liked many of the retellings of that classic story  you may enjoy this the visuals are stunning and although the dialogue is a little wooden it certainly isnt more wooden than george lucas dialogue i didnt particularly care for the spirit stallion of the cimarron noble savage element and really wish they could have given the actor a shirt but overall i liked the film and will watch the second half
Dec 24 2023,positive,superb starting point of what could be an excellent universe i just want more
Dec 24 2023,positive,i dont get the hate on this movie it was good
Dec 24 2023,negative,rarely i am compelled to review a film but this film is awful there have been many movies attempting to emulate star wars this being with this being a terrible tribute    so many plot holes no character development forced dialogues with weak monologues poor acting not all  and unnecessary slow mos     the cinematography is nice but everything feels forced so many scenes are unbelievable and unnecessary and and obvious copy and paste from previous versions    i assume the next films will fill in the details but in reality i dont want to waste time my time with them    overhyped but im sure ladbible will make sure its popular
Dec 24 2023,positive,the best weve had on interplanetary war themes in recent times i hope star wars gets back on track
Dec 24 2023,negative,one of snyderss favorite authors is ayn rand and they have something in common they are both terrible writers who write unrealistic characters
Dec 24 2023,negative,i love sci fi and waited expectantly for rebel moonthe ludicrous premises are too many to write here put together like an anthology of stupidity and unbelievability zack should be ashamed unwatchable
Dec 23 2023,negative,this was the worst movie ive ever seen
Dec 23 2023,negative,this was really awful painfully ridiculous consider turning off the sound and just watching the visuals
Dec 23 2023,negative,very much 300 in space  only not as good
Dec 23 2023,negative,visually stunning shallow retelling of the seven samurai comically evil villans dispatched with ease by our 90lb girl boss   shallow and boring while being visually appealing is about all i can say about it
Dec 23 2023,positive,a fun scifi action flick to watch
Dec 23 2023,negative,if you are looking to watch a good movie this aint it visually can be stunning but the dialogue is terrible acting is very wooden plus the pacing is worst that i have seen the fact that it is compared to star wars is laughable
Dec 23 2023,positive,though it takes some ideas from other space operas this is not a bad thing it has clear direction paced worldbuilding nearperfect casting and a plot loose enough to let the characters breathe organically     when the group is being recruited there are two clichéd scenes which could have been more tactful i imagine in the directors cut that they will be     following in the footsteps of star wars dune and foundation rebel moon is a fun and exciting ride with exposition enough to tickle the fancy of any true science fiction fan     i am excited to see where the sequels take us i have my ticket and some popcorn at the ready
Dec 23 2023,positive,come on  this movie is not that bad your expectation and the hype around the movie made you think its bad but honestly if try being objective this movie is pretty good visually beautiful story nothing exceptional but good enough to make me want to see the second part this is not the movie of the year for sure but still better than any movie disney has done lately 
Dec 23 2023,positive,its a really good sci fi movie    redemption is always going to be a winner and a few good people facing insurmountable odds is the stuff heroism is made of    ive yet to see what creative work critics have accomplished all they do is tear down what they cannot do
Dec 23 2023,positive,beautifully shot film  great action  wish it was longer so we got some more story but maybe the r rated cut will fill this void but soo excited for part 2
Dec 23 2023,positive,a fun space action adventure the fact that critics are flogging it just shows what a bunch of pretentious wankers they all are
Dec 23 2023,negative,the part 01 is a ok movie at maximum nothing new nothing good just a ok movie
Dec 23 2023,positive,a original stand alone adaptation off of the star wars saga people will knock it for that but it has the feel and power of it without drawing you towards something else it has great graphics and a overall powerful sense of good vs evil that empowers the mind and soul
Dec 23 2023,positive,found it a good movie i went in with low expectations because of the critic reviews but found it enjoyable  not anywhere near star wars but a fun to watch at home just hope the next one is better with the dialogue and storytelling has potential to be a good trilogy if quality increases
Dec 23 2023,positive,i really love this movie
Dec 23 2023,positive,amazing story cast and visuals cant wait for part 2
Dec 23 2023,positive,amazing film and an amazing cast well done zack on this intergalactic masterpiece
Dec 23 2023,positive,very fun and entertaining movie not a surprise critics didnt like it typical really this isnt the next lord of the rings but honestly compared to the movies released over the last 3 years its one of the best ones
Dec 23 2023,positive,pretty standard scifi movie  not great not bad  a good weekend or rainy day movie
Dec 23 2023,positive,just another poorly written mediocre acting and even worse directing movie amazing concept though interesting worlds and animals just a shame it was so subpar in the end hopefully part 2 is much better
Dec 23 2023,negative,story wasnt that interesting and cgi was pretty bad
Dec 23 2023,positive,great acting wonderful world building i did wish it was longer complaining about a space opera not being mind blowingly original is asinine
Dec 23 2023,positive,good start with a new universe should get better from here
Dec 23 2023,negative,waaay to much slow motion there is clear a biger concern in special effects and impact scenes than with the story itself  the excessive slowmo is a really bad habit in snider movies and the level of excess is really annoying the excess get to the point where theres scenes in super slowmo inside slowmo scenes argh
Dec 23 2023,negative,1 star because its a beautiful film to look at but thats it the writing is just god awful and only barely hangs in there supported by an a list cast
Dec 23 2023,positive,see our non spoiler review on x  youtube zaneandcat
Dec 23 2023,positive,great visuals and action scenes  character development and dialogs are missing
Dec 23 2023,negative,i am so disappointed   with all the hype this turned out to be a dud    the action subpar to much slow motion and there is no depth to the characters   the dialogue seems to be written by a teenager the only saving grace is ed skrein    he is the only one who is does any decent acting      sofia boutella is not believable as some sort of super warrior      tragic acting by djimon hounsou    he over acts and seems to force his lines     dont waste your time
Dec 23 2023,negative,i wanted this movie to be good but its not the first 30 minutes could have easily been cut down due it a lot of it being unnecessary every fight scene was 80 slow motion for the sake of slow motion and the characters are very flat this cast is loaded and they deserved better
Dec 23 2023,positive,just add 20 more mins and give us a proper intro followed by a bit more depth then the superobvious plot line  couldve really been a solid start to the new franchise instead its a solid waste of time
Dec 23 2023,positive,actually great idea but i do believe the dc would flesh it out more as it feels short 2 hours is not enough for all the cool concepts expressed that does not make it a bad film of course im excited to see where the next part takes us
Dec 23 2023,negative,really bad acting its just a bad rip off of all different movies but we no feeling it is so predictable like it was written by ai after watching loads of scifi and then told to write a movie using all these movies
Dec 23 2023,positive,its exactly what the director said it was seven samurai in space or another way of putting it magnificent seven meets star wars its very entertaining love the casting and the lead sofia boutella think naksu meets rita vrataski part 1 has a dystopian atmosphere and focuses mainly on recruiting rebel fighters with some battles here and there to keep it exciting it sets up part 2 nicely its good scifi
Dec 23 2023,negative,utter garbage   poor green screen effects laughable dialogue delivered by dlist actors and a plot that makes little sense
Dec 23 2023,negative,this movie has more in common with his 2002 dawn of the dead in that this movie just didnt die you think its over but no it keeps going not that the visuals werent unimpressive they were however the dialogue the story its a 2 hour movie with 90 mins of exposition were they ripping off star trek star wars harry potter villains too evil to possibly exist is the main bad guy a space nazi or a space peaky blinder too many locations a cat with a beak stuck on it terrible cgi awful unlovable characters predictable twists
Dec 23 2023,positive,great film little predictable but very entertaining
Dec 23 2023,positive,yes theres plot holes character development issues and story beats thatseem to go nowhere but i still really enjoyed the film because for all of these negatives it also did so much right it gave us a rich unique universe ripe for exploration a well crafted mysterious competent main character that i want to keep following audio and visuals that a distinctly their own despite how many tropes and ideas were borrowed from other famous scifi stories like dune and the chronicles of riddick everyone is quick to say this film rips off star wars while seeming to forget that star wars was heavily inspired by flash gordon and dune    i admired the objectively good set design the stupendous score and the sense of curiosity about where the story is going to go and ya know whati think the audience score on rotten tomatoes is right 70 is completely fair this movie is without a doubt a 710 a flawed yet intriguing first entry into a new franchise that has room to blossom into something that could last for years to come or crumble under the weight of its own talented yet at times pretentious creator
Dec 23 2023,positive,the action and graphics were epic started slow with alot of story build up but enough beautiful scenery to keep it going the build up for the next movie is intense and i cant wait to see the next chapter dont listen to the critics on this one this movie is great
Dec 23 2023,negative,show dont tell this movie ignores this rule completely the characters dont even talk to each other except the protagonist a lot of scenes just strung together its trash tier
Dec 23 2023,positive,critics are pretentious idiots who offer their self indulgent opinions that nobody cares about  the movie does a great job of building a world and bringing its characters together for a common cause
Dec 23 2023,positive,fuck yes totally buying what this flick is selling  fantastic action sneaky good plot  cant wait for part 2 
Dec 23 2023,positive,enjoyed the movie and i am looking forward to part 2
Dec 23 2023,positive,a great and high quality retooling of seven samurai fantastic characters landscapes and a well paced and engaging story that already has me wanting part two dont believe the hater critics see and judge for yourself
Dec 23 2023,neutral,synder just isnt very good im afraid this movie is all over the place     and for those who consistently blame the producers studios etc when he releases something bad a good director knows how to negotiate with those people to get what you want
Dec 23 2023,positive,i just watched a great movie and after seeing the critics i had an instant deja vu it feels like star wars when the prequels were released  you simply cannot please everyone  i loved more the prequels than the sequels and seeing the criticism of rebel moon it seems that these are the same fans who hated the prequels when they were released  its such a great movie
Dec 23 2023,positive,think for yourself the haters are gonna hate i didnt think it was perfect but close to it and its probably the best movie of the year it would take alot of money to make me talk bad about this movie hint hint disney ill take 1 million  to lie for you but since they are not i love this movie and i cant wait for more this site is a joke for the reviews please dont be a sheep and think for yourself
Dec 23 2023,positive,visually it is a treat the story line regardless of what professional critics say is compelling looking forward to the next part
Dec 23 2023,negative,bad battlefieldearthbad
Dec 23 2023,positive,i loved it  i was a little disappointed is wasnt a series but i cant wait for the second half in april 2024  i enjoyed the characters and like the choice of actors to play them
Dec 23 2023,positive,loved it cant wait for part 2
Dec 23 2023,negative,hes very good with visuals but his stories are boring and his characters are flat the best movies hes done were stories from other people it looks like he does not have anything to say
Dec 23 2023,negative,this was painful to watch you want it to be good but it just isnt you hope it gets better but it wont its sad
Dec 23 2023,negative,no originality clichéd plot and unimaginative directing
Dec 23 2023,negative,too many slow motion scenes it also feels like a low quality patchwork of other scifi franchises the acting feels forced and overall the movie is very hard to watch until the end
Dec 23 2023,positive,too many critics dont know what a good scifi is it doesnt need to be perfect but exciting newfresh some good action interesting characters and adventure most of all entertaining 5 stars if youre a chill scifi fan if youre very specific 354
Dec 23 2023,positive,looked great action was pretty cool seen the story before but how many original movies do you see now anyway would have liked some more fun moments but generally enjoyed it cant understand the massively negative reviews from the critics
Dec 23 2023,positive,a sci fi epic there isnt anything not to like about it
Dec 23 2023,negative,jeeesus christ that was rotten
Dec 23 2023,negative,i waited for this movie for a while to be disappointed lets say i had high hopes for it i guess but its no less than any movie really i give it 2 stars cause they say voetsek we love voetsekand that uniform gosh its fire but except those it would be 1 star really
Dec 23 2023,positive,amazing sets and special effects but the story is muh and the characters are not great  one accent in particular is sore on the ears when it is a family one he should have stuck to geordie  i think the problem is that because it is spread across 2 films the pace was slower than expected lets wait and see what the second installment brings
Dec 23 2023,negative,i feel like hollywood just reached the lvl of bollywood these movies are terrible zero original story the script is extremly dull i dont really know how anyone could like this   i know whats gonna happen in all the scenes  all of the ideas been in a movie before   dont waste ur time to watch
Dec 23 2023,negative,where to start rebel moon has to be the biggest disappointment of the year so much hype and anticipation for a movie just for it turn out to be as interesting as watching paint drywith a touch of slow mo i thought zack would do better being free from wb but he just got worse and theres no one to blame this time
Dec 23 2023,negative,the film is filled moved along by character decisions that make no sense relative to what has actually gone on in the story  exposition dumps occur regularly because the writing is to poor to show you what is happening so it has to tell you yet even those explanations dont match up with the in universe reasoning    this is terrible and anyone involved in the creative process of it should feel great shame
Dec 23 2023,positive,something new and fresh with a lot of creativity something disney will never make deserves more praise than its getting
Dec 23 2023,positive,i really enjoyed this  its kind of what i wish the new star wars movies were like
Dec 23 2023,positive,the movie is better than what people are saying im looking forward to part two
Dec 23 2023,positive,this part is setting everything up i honestly never read the books or source material but i thoroughly enjoyed it theres some lagging scenes but i believe that its needed to develop the entire series  i think honestly you have to give it a go and see for yourself and see what you think  its not as action packed as some would hope but again its the first part again i enjoyed it hope youll give it a go and make your own judgement
Dec 23 2023,positive,good enough entertaining nothing life changing
Dec 23 2023,positive,a more than notable film although it draws from several sources 300 star wars the magnificent seven no one seems to remember that these last two have influences or come directly from seven samurai  it is increasingly clear to me that specialized critics live in a distorted reality we are not going to ask for a handful of oscars for the film but please respect a film that is fun and really well made  i highly recommend watching it you will not be disappointed waiting for the second part
Dec 23 2023,positive,awesome visuals superb cast and incredible entertaining
Dec 23 2023,positive,imagine firefly in a early medival setting minus the wit is it perfect hell no but it shure entertained me for all its 2 hour runtime and is that not what we came here for
Dec 23 2023,negative,mediocre at best so many scenes were predictablethe villain kills people with a cane a cane ok there were a couple of good action scenes and the effects for the most part were decentbut i felt there was no soul in the movie characters were flat some slow scenes almost put me to sleep i really was hoping for something better and more exciting
Dec 23 2023,positive,its by far the best scififantasy movie i have seen this year after dungeons and dragons its not to say that its a masterpiece but its not a disney star wars or a marvel movie and its good enough to be excited about the next installments i will definitively rewatch this movie again
Dec 23 2023,positive,magnificent 7 meets starwars vibe  i dont know why people didnt like this movie  it is super entertaining you can tell that it has a bug budget as soon as anthony hopkins does the voice over intro  if you dont like sci fi action  big explosions or uncomfortable situations not for you  otherwise a lot of fun
Dec 23 2023,positive,excellent environments excellent effects interesting story in short a good movie what the creator should have been
Dec 23 2023,negative,if only theyd spent 10 less on the effects and put the money into a decent script this would have been a lot less awful
Dec 23 2023,positive,once again  a strong female role  she can beat every strong man in the universe  it seems that this movie was made up from bits and pieces from other movies  nothing unique
Dec 23 2023,positive,i feel it could be far better  but it has earn the respect   i want more     1 cig needs a lot of work but most of it was solid     2 story telling was solid  it did not push the max of epic story telling but it did put it way above average     3 ship  was very weak  ship design felt off like less creative and more rushed     4 character arcs felt good solid but not to  strong but good enough  could be better some story line was odd but like the leader dying in the way he died was crazy due to that 1 guy farmer saying something made the main leader murder  it felt forced  not organic
Dec 23 2023,positive,great movie idk why people say it sucked it was great
Dec 23 2023,neutral,it was entertaining  the best way i can describe it would be to say that it plays more like a space dnd with a dm who is pulling their hair out because all of the players rolled the most absurd characters possible and is now desperately trying to keep the shell of his original story idea somewhat intact  that being said there were a lot of interesting worldbuilding tidbits that im curious to hopefully see expanded upon in part two
Dec 23 2023,negative,2 hours  15mins of fluff focused on spectacle over substance boring characters with an even duller plot
Dec 23 2023,positive,i really enjoyed the movie the visuals were fantastic however theres this sense that something is missing its clear that the movie is just one piece of a larger story maybe thats the reasonit feels like there are unanswered questions or parts of the plot that are waiting to be explored in the broader narrative despite this the overall experience was great especially with the stunning visuals looking forward to seeing how the story unfolds in the next installment
Dec 23 2023,negative,horrible in every way
Dec 23 2023,positive,fantastic its what the star wars reboot should have been
Dec 23 2023,positive,its a begining of a brand new story not a reboot sequal or adaptation full of the characteristics of zack and yet a logically good way to introducing a strong female protagonist
Dec 23 2023,positive,listen this movie is actually great and hilarious action and visuals are very good and the northern irish accent are a fun addition in space im irish i think this movie will be better in context of the whole saga
Dec 23 2023,negative,boring story and it feels like nothing gets really explained just jumping from one scene to the other
Dec 23 2023,negative,i went in hoping it would be goodunfortunately i was disappointed poorly writtenbland characters and way too much slo mo
Dec 23 2023,positive,love science fiction nice story good plot  pretty girl what more you want
Dec 23 2023,positive,was expecting it to be a little darker scarier and more action packed too simplistic the main ladys character has no character development shes just inherently cool no struggle no learning curve we just need to assume shes a great fighter even though whatever fighting she indulged in wasnt anything special and most of it is just talked about why should we assume show us something that proves shes a great fighter not just running and screaming in slow mo all the time yes too much slow mo this movie is for 12 year olds who have no experience in watching movies boring give us something dark realistic raw and intense this is just run of the mill copy paste rerun mish mash with average cgi the hype behind this movie for so many years just turned out to be a fart im not really looking forward to the next one
Dec 23 2023,positive,it is awesome just i cried watching it genious work by zack evry one should watch it love from india rebelmoon
Dec 23 2023,negative,it was visually well made but the story and the choice of actors were completely off    it may well be that charlie hunnam is from newcastle  while his attempt at a scottish accent or whatever it was supposed to be was embarrassingly to watch    in general the characters stories lacked depth and it all seemed super shallow    i could go on and on but that would take forever to finish     so heres a quick summary  10 acting  10 story  20 slide attacks  60 slow motion effect    do i think part 2 will be better no
Dec 23 2023,negative,its absolute junk despite going on forever its boring and tedious i dont think the director has managed to make a good movie for years and this certainly isnt one either
Dec 23 2023,positive,a must see better than star wars and provides room for growth in a new sci series
Dec 23 2023,positive,this movie was an incredible beginning to this new franchise  the visual effects fight choreography the worldbuilding the story and each of the characters are top notch  i look forward to seeing this all expanded upon in the upcoming directors cut and in part 2  i have now seen this four times and it gets better with every watch  highly recommended
Dec 23 2023,negative,this felt like all the characters did was stand on a box and give speeches to an audience visually stunning but a dud sad but true
Dec 23 2023,negative,not very good so much of the story was overly dramatic  every single line of dialog seemed forced characters were hastily introduced this is what i imagine the hallmark channel would do with a scifi movie but with a decent visual effects budget
Dec 23 2023,positive,too many voices that are willing to die on the star wars hill     a great film for those who dont want to start at the beginning of sw and only to see the sw saga just go downhill from the first trilogy very watchable and enjoyable
Dec 23 2023,negative,boring hard to watch with 10x speed  story 110  vfx 310  acting 110  boring 1010
Dec 23 2023,negative,interesting universe and visually stunning but falls apart quickly when it follows the same format of every movie of this generation  the story lacks any substance
Dec 23 2023,neutral,it couldve been awesome but unfortunately its just boring endless slow mo in the fight scenes barely any character back story so you dont care what happens to them because your not really invested in it if theyd made a better movie you might be able to look past them basically ripping off 5 other better films maybe hell surprise us all with part 2 but i wont hold my breath
Dec 23 2023,negative,visuals action sequences and overuse of slowmo seem to be the focus vs developing characters i would care the slightest bit about came very close to just shutting it off and have zero interest in part two
Dec 23 2023,positive,zack is the goat this movie has oscar gold written all over
Dec 23 2023,positive,if you take it for what it iscgiscifiaction and are in it for the visuals it is definitely entertaining and ill watch the next one but im a nerd for the alien stuff the tick thing talking through the guy was really cool 
Dec 23 2023,positive,lucas could sue for copyryght claims but all in all it was entertaining what would be way better is if they took horus heresy from warhammer 40k and made it into live action
Dec 23 2023,positive,anyone who likes star wars will love this film the first part is still lacking in depth it essentially serves to introduce the characters i think it will be great
Dec 23 2023,positive,a classic tale retold for modern audiences it was a beautiful spectacle i would have loved to see this in theaters 5 star movie
Dec 23 2023,positive,homages lots of previous things visually pretty amazing    the story mythology and the world building is excellent excited to see part 2
Dec 23 2023,negative,very basic plot and doesnt bring anything new to the genre very forgetable movie
Dec 23 2023,negative,its so bad in so many different levels that i cant believe it actually got produced
Dec 23 2023,positive,love it cant wait for part 2
Dec 23 2023,positive,sick of you horrible critics putting negative scores on masterpieces like this        you have absolutely no leg to stand on as you shout your filth against art and creativity that has been portrayed in part one of this film    you say things like uninspiring or artistically negligent  i look forward to assessing your other reviews and wonder what it takes to be earn a decent score in the eyes of a rotton tomato these days      as it stands the tomato standards are out of balance and out of touch  these reviews are garbage and should be thrown out as such    garrett coster
Dec 23 2023,positive,incredible movie obviously inspired by many films visuals are top tier good dialogue and the universe makes you want part 2 immediately
Dec 23 2023,positive,despite its downsides i thought it was an entertaining movie what happened zack so much potential and beautiful cinematography but the writing on this is a disaster zero character development sorry big friend zack but this was a 610 being generous
Dec 23 2023,negative,this movie felt a lot like star wars  but without any of the likable and memorable characters a definite swing and a miss
Dec 23 2023,negative,bad acting scripts fault bad script awful slowmo action scenes at some point sofia makes nonsensical moves too obvious because of that slomo not an original idea in sight everything cool is a ripoff of something else and not a decent character development in there  glad it wasnt part of star wars as it wouldve been the death of the franchise bad storytelling with great but far from flawless visuals doesnt make a good movie although im sure the easily entertained will like it
Dec 23 2023,negative,i really tried to watch this film but oof the dialogue was bad not feeling the visual effects no character development this is zss worst film ever i enjoyed sucker punch more than this film
Dec 23 2023,negative,basic plot basic story basic characters nothing super interesting about this movie but it passed the time the amount of slowmotion was cringe too
Dec 23 2023,negative,high school writing quality they threw in characters that had no back story so you didnt give a hoot about them dont see this
Dec 23 2023,positive,i thought it was great entertainment visually stunning and one of the better movies i have watched this year no it wasnt original nothing deep and meaningful but i simply dont care still enjoyed it for what it was
Dec 23 2023,positive,absolutely fantastic movie it was exciting the whole way through much much better than most movies that have came out recentlyi am a huge star wars fan and i loved this i do not understand the negative critic reviews makes you wonder if theres something influencing those reviews    pacing was excellent fight scenes were absolutely amazing plot was okay but overall really enjoyed this
Dec 23 2023,positive,it was a good movie dont listen to critics    the only issue i have with it it needs to be longer it felt alittle rushed     make part 2 longer
Dec 23 2023,positive,with all the bad reviews and trash comments i was honestly expecting to be dissapointed but i finished watchign this movie very excited i cant wait for part 2 loved rebel moon
Dec 23 2023,positive,loved it hope it becomes a whole universe
Dec 23 2023,positive,awesome storyline and stunning visual effects the movie has every engriendient to make me want to watch from start to finish its an awesome action scifi screen and i am looking forward to seeying part ii
Dec 23 2023,positive,the movie is a visual spectacle  its not a home run but it is a triple  the story is a similar tale to the magnificent seven  i fell asleep during another recent scifi release which i thought was pretty good but i was wide awake for the full length of rebel moon  like a new restaurant it only matters if you want to go back i definitely cant wait for part two  it did seem a little like the story only set up the individual set pieces but the set pieces were pretty cool  anyhow hopefully part two fleshes out the characters and continues to build the universe of rebel moon
Dec 23 2023,positive,i think critics are so out of touch these days this movie was great great visuals great sound great casting and great story the only issue i had was i could tell some of the editing cut out pieces that would have added to the story but thats the way it goes these days and i am sure the directors cut will fix it even without the directors cut though it was a very entertaining movie and i cant wait for the second one
Dec 23 2023,positive,beautiful visuals and score the characters and story have heart and depth which im hoping will be fleshed out more in the directors cut and part 2 the action is impressive and the mythology is rich definitely left me wanting more
Dec 23 2023,positive,i thought the movie was brilliant excellent special effects fantastic cast a must see
Dec 23 2023,positive,this movie is amazing i simply dont know why citics say bad things about the movie just watch this it a whole different vibe thanks zack for making an amazing master piece like this
Dec 23 2023,positive,too much slow motion and the story is predictable but i really enjoyed myself and it is way better then what ever disney produced in the last 2 years the movie did its job i was entertained 
Dec 23 2023,negative,i am pretty open minded and went in neutral despite the bad reviews and finding most of snyders stuff to be ok for what they are straight up though this was just a bad movie in every aspect imaginable    the special effects the fighting scenes the cuts the camera work there is a depth of field gimmick used so poorly in the movie to try and hide how bad the cgi environs are  the writing the terrible acting the story    its all made for tv sci fi chanel movie level garbage i am genuinely shocked at just how bad this was     genuinely one of the worst movies of seen in some time
Dec 23 2023,negative,poorly executed battle beyond the stars remake destined to be a trash cinema classic
Dec 23 2023,positive,absolutely fantastic its difficult to create something new  new world characters planets from scratch they have to already established in the story you create and we pick it up as we go this was done well and the characters still have stories to tell the second movie should fill in the gaps as many sequels do but everything is engaging thus far
Dec 23 2023,negative,main char is boring and bland twist is so predictable i they won the fight is just stupid
Dec 23 2023,positive,movie has good action enjoying the space scenes
Dec 23 2023,negative,i was rooting for this movie but it turns out that its just a terrible recycled version of dune with elements from star wars star trek beyond and avatar there are scores of original writers and stories out there waiting for a screenplay i had to force myself to finish while occupying my boredom on the phone
Dec 23 2023,negative,a very poor remake of seven samuraimagnificent sevenbugs life that steals from every major franchise it has scenes straight out of star wars harry potter game of thrones dune firefly indian jone lord of the rings warhammer 40k etc it is only 2 hours long because half the film is in slow motion including ploughing a filed ffs
Dec 23 2023,negative,wth i only made it through the first 45 minutes before enough was enough i really wanted to love this but its just bad the recruiting  of the fighterscharacters to oppose the mother world was absolutely cringe worthy this trope is better executed in bad donghua and anime this is a disappointment and a shame
Dec 23 2023,positive,i see this as early days they are world building and introducing characters to see the scene so its a bit slow in places and not mind blowing yet but i can see definite potential here  the scenery is beautiful and although its heavily cgi enhanced it doesnt distract which is great   the fight scenes are fantastic as i knew they would be as sofia boutella excels at physical combat in most of her films though as others have said there is a lot of slow motion in the fight scenes but its probably just to give you time to process everything that is happening as its often quite a lot   great cast not sure about staz nair maybe ill warm to him but everyone else was superb and delivered good or very good performances   overall very entertaining though and i look forward to more
Dec 23 2023,positive,as i thought it wasnt as terrible as the critic reviews suggested it was entertaining to me i thought it did some things really well the story concept has me perfected although its a bit jumbled my biggest critique is the pacing and the really bad cgi of the ships they looked really out of place lol
Dec 23 2023,positive,great storyline amazing visuals unexpected twists and turns may have been better served as a series though to flush out the story more explore the lore and explore each character
Dec 23 2023,positive,awesome movie zacks done it again
Dec 23 2023,positive,not bad not great too much action too little plot but not hard to watch
Dec 23 2023,negative,the movie starts in a farming community this part showed promise as the characters were endearing and the danger they were in was compelling once the movie moved on from that community the character development was almost nonexistent i had difficulty caring what happened to any of them some of the special effects were good but the frequent fight scenes were jammed with way too many slow motion periods i became so bored i wanted to turn the movie off stupidly i stuck with it i wish i hadnt
Dec 23 2023,positive,dont let the ignorant online hate keep you from watching one of the best movies of 2023 i swear if the same movie came out but the directors name was scorsese coppola or hell even nathan fielder the critics would be praising this movie and it would have a 95 on here
Dec 23 2023,positive,i really love this movie not what i was expected but a fresh movie in this lack of content in the recent years that can entretain you with something that can be watchable sofia boutella looks awesome i really hope the next movies give more to the development of characters
Dec 23 2023,neutral,i actually quite enjoyed the movie i thought the special effects were pretty good  the only thing letting it down was kais northern irish accent it was truly truly awful and did ruin the movie a bit for me
Dec 23 2023,positive,well when watching its quite easy to see right off the bat why so many people are being critical of this film its definitely not without its flaws and there are several however from what ive heard theres to be an r rated directors cut being released next spring purportedly featuring an additional hour or so of extra content thats meant to fill in the majority of gaps in the character development and storyline issues that people keep complaining about     i agree with many on this point that although its technically a movie with 2 hour runtime it does feel seemingly rushed through but on the upside i thought the pacing moved along pretty swiftly throughout aka meaning i didnt find myself at all getting bored those 2 hours blew by and admittedly by the time the credits were rolling i was left feeling the desire to see more which isnt so bad since part ii is supposedly being released soonish    so me personally im eager to watch the directors cut despite an estimated runtime of 35 hours i believe the upcoming extended release version will potentially add on another 12 star to my initial rating due to it providing a sense of completeness to whatever seemed lacking from the first edit     in summary was this the absolute best scifi flick of the year that rivals the likes of the monolithic galaxies portrayed in star wars oh hell to the nobut was it something thats adequately entertaining dazzling to eyes and a fairly decent way to spend an evening passing some time yes yes i believe it is
Dec 23 2023,positive,a nice break from the super hero movies thats been flooding us in the movies and tv
Dec 23 2023,positive,loved it from beginning to the end
Dec 23 2023,negative,nothing of real interest cgi was good thats about it  everything was predictable
Dec 23 2023,positive,not bad for an intro to the franchise i guess clearly most of the budget went to visuals worldbuilding and character development is a little thin especially the main character still not bad considering the runtime of only 2 hours i hope part 2 is better
Dec 23 2023,positive,as usual critics are out of their minds is rebel moon citizen kaneabsolutely not but that doesnt mean its not enjoyable
Dec 23 2023,positive,loved it the look of the everything in this movie is amazing the sound especially the ship thrusters was remarkable  without getting into details of the storythe twist got me hard    cant wait for the part 2
Dec 23 2023,negative,story was a jumbled mess you dont build any care for the characters to mush slow motion that doesnt have the intended effect overall a poorly done movie only thing that was good was the acting
Dec 23 2023,negative,this movie celebrates the worst of zs
Dec 23 2023,negative,probably the worst movie my son and i have seen in the past few years honestly its so awful its to the point of laughter bad worst dialogue nonstop front loaded exposition awful acting fragmented scenes jumbled together tropes are lame and recycled everything ripped off from either star wars dc or marvel but executed 1100th as well  its so bad that we turned rebel moon on for the third time cant watch something this awful in one sitting just to get some laughs in by then last 10m we were laughing nonstop it was some lame and ridiculous everyone who participated in writing the script should be fired
Dec 23 2023,positive,i thought the movie was excellent as a scifi  horror fan  well done  excellent character choices and actors  visuals and storyline were great  so excited for part 2 
Dec 23 2023,positive,to my sons and i it was warhammer 40k meets the magnificent 7  we enjoyed it and cant wait for the next installment  we liked the characters and the setting  its so much better than most things being put out
Dec 23 2023,positive,the movie was amazing very gripping was filmed beautifully excited for the next one
Dec 23 2023,positive,really enjoyed the movie looking forward to part 2
Dec 23 2023,positive,i enjoyed it  is it perfect no but it is highly entertaining  cant wait for part 2
Dec 23 2023,positive,clearly based on a mix of stories and details from other movies still a good story and a good film
Dec 23 2023,positive,pretty good movie especially if you like a decent sci fi flick glad i watched it i will watch again and hope for a sequel
Dec 23 2023,negative,it was a bugs life with people so much potential with interesting characters that were not utilized in this part hope they go into those stories in pt 2 visuals are nice have some eye candy and kickass female fighters but not good at all it was so bad it turned my stomach
Dec 23 2023,negative,whoa make sure you watch this one on trash pickup day because this movie hot garbage since it is visually stunning i moved it from 1star to 2stars but it honestly has nothing else going for it other than beautiful set pieces after spending 2 hours with these characters i can honestly say you will know them as well at the beginning of the movie as you do at the end the character development is almost nonexistent and then we are asked to care when certain characters are killed  but there is 0 emotional connection and the story is so wideranging you would need to make it a series to do it justice     going from place to place to collect a ragtag group of fighters for an upcoming battle our heroine encounters one person after another who wants no part of it  only to have their mind changed by a threesentence speech from our protagonist ummi dont think so this on top of being introduced to a couple of characters early on that are made to feel like they will be integral to the plotline only to have them completely disappear after the first 10 minutes
Dec 23 2023,positive,good movie  i would definitely watch a sequel  it has a good overall story and i look forward to seeing the story continue
Dec 23 2023,neutral,wasnt bad but wasnt good either the story has lots of holes in it character development is janky but it passed the time
Dec 23 2023,negative,boring  lame star wars ripoff  i fell asleep multiple times
Dec 23 2023,positive,amazing i just think these critics have trouble following a complex scifi story
Dec 23 2023,positive,for me its decent not zacks best nor his worst i will say go ahead and release the directors cut its not a terrible movie imo but it does feel like something missing
Dec 23 2023,positive,this is a good movie  many have stated it is derivative of star wars and the magnificent seven  so what the magnificent seven was remake of the seven samurai  i like the visuals and the action scenes    sure  anyone can guess the plot line  sit back with a beer or glass of wine and enjoy the ride  good mind candy
Dec 23 2023,negative,from the first scene on the visuals characterisation and acting combine into something that feels looks and sounds like a bad case of cgi fanfic and so it turns to be on the edge of being unwatchable you just feel strung along in a story that seems to continuously grouse this is what star wars should be and that is before someone thought it was a good idea to resurrect general bison
Dec 23 2023,positive,good fun movie and cant wait for part 2
Dec 23 2023,positive,i loved the cinematic visual effects but as a first part to a 2 part story i feel that there was missing a deeper story of every characters
Dec 23 2023,negative,not sure why anyones calling this visually dazzling the first 30 minutes on the farm planet middle earth tattooine have a few fun looking aliens and some very lord of the rings inspired set dressing even though everyone seems to have dressed at the local gap outlet    after the first 30 minutes everything is underlit out of focus with enough lens flare to choke jj abrams every space location is a murky featureless unpopulated void every ship is an underdetailed conglomeration of boxy shapes     this is dull and derivative from start to finish its limited imagination seemingly butting against a limited budget half of the effects look good half look like they were rendered in 2003     if you really want an incomprehensible overstuffed scifi epic with terrible dialog but pretty visuals just watch jupiter ascending its better which is saying something
Dec 23 2023,positive,amazing forget the critic fanboys get your popcorn out this is a good one
Dec 23 2023,negative,this film was boring i was sick of the slow motion button and for the love of god can a director stop with this i have a directors cut but its the studios fault excuse its becoming clear zack is great at visuals but storytelling not so much especially when it comes to a complex plot  im sorry the lead while shes an ok actress she is not a lead i didnt care about a single character not one
Dec 23 2023,positive,rb is amazing cant wait for the next part
Dec 23 2023,negative,couldnt get me to care about any of the main characters the dialogue was groaninducing everything felt like moving from one set piece to another characters get introduced only to disappear for the rest of the movie too many characters but not enough character development when one of the blood axes died i got from the music that it was supposed to be dramatic and emotional but i had made ni connection to the character to care the action sequences and fight choreography were amateurish and frankly a little cartoonish and for all the somewhat fancy graphics the world felt small and onedimensional    as a huge scifi geek i really wanted this show to be good alas it was not to be
Dec 23 2023,positive,fantastic amazing  interesting  great storyline and great cast  cant wait for part 2
Dec 23 2023,positive,great movie critics are either blind or paid off i can not wait for the next one
Dec 23 2023,positive,it was awesome  the visuals  the costumes  the story  the characters it was all well done  it seemed to me that it was in my opinion what star wars should have been  with little to no comic relief and a ton of action
Dec 23 2023,positive,rebel moon is a visually stunning film sofia boutella delivers a great performance as the lead character the villains were great at making me truly dislike them through out the film a much better film to experience on rewatch
Dec 23 2023,positive,im not sure what movie the so called critics watched its definitely better than 23
Dec 23 2023,positive,amazing visuals and lots of world building intriguing story and the cast did a great job with all that said the third act seemed a bit rushed and the pacing was fast throughout the movie starting at about 30 mins in id recommend the movie but im more excited for the directors cut to explore this world further and see unhinged zack id give this a b or a cb
Dec 23 2023,positive,whooo all the hate for nothing yes there is slow motion that it is too much some times and yelling lirics in slowmo but what bother me the most was the blur he used way to much and makes the film look bad other than that is a must see cant believe this was 2 hrs it was like wahtching 45 mins
Dec 23 2023,positive,im not sure why critics are not liking this perhaps hollywood is telling them not to i found this very well done the story was interesting the plot was excellent the acting was good and the special effects were movie theater quality the world building was well thought out as well i know this was originally pitched as a star wars movie but i think its much better than anything lately that disney has put out i cant wait for part 2 to come out
Dec 23 2023,positive,loved the visuals and the possibility of more world building and character development i was only let down by less screen time of the other characters like those are missed opportunities i just dont get why they have to do a directors cut when they can just release the 3hr version also i was hoping to see a batman warehouse type of action but nope maybe on the second part
Dec 23 2023,negative,some great visuals but wooden acting and a mess of a story cant save this mashup of everything scifi in the microwave
Dec 23 2023,positive,the art in this movie was amazing mate the guns where amazing the sound effects where on point the slow mo of ray fisher smashing that pole in the ship  the aliens  that was epic  cannot wait for part 2
Dec 23 2023,positive,its a great movie with a lot of fun ideas people need to understand this is part one
Dec 23 2023,positive,such a great movie in point too dont know why rotten tomatoes has rated it so low one of the best movies ive seen for years cant wait for part 2
Dec 23 2023,negative,such a lazy movie and even worse acting
Dec 23 2023,negative,this was as much fun as star wars rise of skywalker and that s not good the moment the movie completely lost me was the gryphon scene i thought who is this for i am not a child i don t think this is cool or fantastic it was so cliched and silly but then before this scene there were two sexual assaults so why should this be for children if i want to watch a mysterious boy tame a gryphon i ll watch harry potter imagine grand moff tarkin had tried to sexually assauly leia gritty right   we start with bar hero next scene gryphon boy asian jedi lady dirty general the scenes just happen and that s how they pick up the members of their superteam why anyone would join her no idea it just happens   the characters all have funky accents or dialects never wash up or change their clothes no matter where they are gryphon boy should put on a jacket i know his abs are amazing but doesn t he ever get chilly   there isn t really more to say about the characters in this movie their characterization is their outfits and the weird way each individual speaks   i am sorry i think this was trash and not the good kind of trash the 13th warrior with antonio banderas is good trash also seven samurai inspired watch that and give it 5 stars if you must but not this  why just one star because it is bad and very long and we will have to endure an even longer version this movie wastes too much time
Dec 23 2023,positive,pleasantly surprised at the story effects synchronization and depth of this story     critics will pan this film but the people will love it
Dec 23 2023,positive,if you like scifi this is good it has homages paid to the genre through out it i have read critic reviews and i am convinced i would not like many of the critics irl
Dec 23 2023,positive,trope city if they had spent a bit more on the script and less on the flash then this magnificent seven wanna be just might have been something  if i had spent money on the big screen to see it i would have been upsetstreaming it at least takes the edge off visuals are good acting isjust two steps above reading the script verbatim if its late and you cant sleep then give it a whirl otherwise youre not missing out by missing this
Dec 23 2023,positive,a fantastic film great fun  incredible cinematography cant wait for part 2
Dec 23 2023,positive,i just saw this move and had some doubts the reviews are not great but i was pleasantly surprised if you dont compare it to anything and just take it at face value its not a bad movie in todays world you can watch a different movie at the push of a button so for a movie to hold my attention for 2 hours that to me is a good move
Dec 23 2023,positive,the professional critics giving this movie a 25 are the worst of internet trolls this is a very entertaining epic scale scifi movie sure there could be a little more character development or a little less homage to movies like the seven samurai but at the end of the day all these stories have been told you wont regret watching this unless youre a real weenie
Dec 23 2023,positive,it has the best of the director visually the story is serious and creates enough drama and the story line as the first act of several future chapters
Dec 23 2023,positive,a big budget knockoff of a low budget knockoff  basically this is a knockoff of battle beyond the stars the 1980 roger corman film which was in itself a knockoff of both star wars and the magnificent seven set in space there was nothing new here that hadnt been already done over 40 years ago  very disappointed in zack as this was a very lazy attempt to spit shine an old doorknob  i pray that part 2 as well as the directors cuts add some extra polish to this film otherwise it was just an overhyped and very expensive exercise in lazy storytelling
Dec 23 2023,positive,definitely was a much needed scifi action adventure film worth the wait the story film graphics actorsactresses were awesome what we need now is either part 2 andor the uncut versions
Dec 23 2023,positive,i dont know what the critics are smoking i really enjoyed this and plan to watch again
Dec 23 2023,negative,this is an example of forced filmmaking the story is not compelling nor are the characters believable the acting consists primarily of reading monologues or staring angrily at the camera there is nothing memorable about the music scenery or the vehicle design move along this is not the film you are looking for 
Dec 23 2023,negative,some scenes are just a joke lot of marketing lack of raw material will not be watching part 2
Dec 23 2023,positive,masterpiece of modern sf
Dec 23 2023,positive,cant wait for the next one i think it was very good
Dec 23 2023,positive,i thought it really good modern take on 7 samurais its everything that the star wars sequels could have been but werent i would definitely recommend my wife even liked it lol
Dec 23 2023,positive,ok sp you can see almost from the beginning it was meant to be a star wars movie but its sufficiently reworked to be something different borrows not just from sw but warhammer seven samurai dune  others  took its time to spell out the story and while characters are solid some could have done with a bit more polishing its interesting enough to keep you watching to the end  i have a feeling pt2 will even better   its a good film way better than anything contained the sw sequels it concentrates on telling the story which is what is most important i dont what film the critics watched but it wasnt this one this is a good film
Dec 23 2023,positive,this is something else it is good maybe nit great but us very entertaining visuals in general are great some cgi does look strange at times when ir comes to characterscreatures this is the first of three so  it clearly st up characters and story so its not expected to be action packed though it delivers accordingly yeah is not nothing new in terms of cifi fantasy i didnt like the element of having a fantasy magical creature but the rest of the concept of a universe more looking like ours gives it a different touch some people might expect more futuristic aspect but that would be a star warsstar trek thing its obvious they wanted ro be far away from that and that is fine
Dec 23 2023,positive,i dont understand critics much these days i enjoyed this movie and felt predictable but i want to see story to the end enjoyable action and for me characters were developed enough that i rooted for good guys and hated bad guys
Dec 23 2023,positive,this is a great movie  best of 2023  stunning visuals  i cannot wait to see part 2
Dec 23 2023,positive,a visual treat which the potential for awesome world building loved it bring on the extended edition and part 2
Dec 23 2023,positive,enjoyed it even if it takes from scifi everywhere its worth a watch
Dec 23 2023,negative,a really bad remake of seven samurai its been remade before but much better the magnificent seven a bugs life even the low budget battle beyond the stars was better than this a slow mo action mess of a movie thats full of boring exposition
Dec 23 2023,negative,the film has zero ideas of its own the story is based on akira kurosawas masterpiece the seven samurai or later the western remake the magnificent seven then add borrowings from star wars a pinch of dune a little avatar and stir vigorously an almost painfully frequent use of slowmotion effects as if the director wanted to say we couldnt think of anything thats why were making the film so artificially long illogical situations such as a simple farmer who has never left his home planet before knows how to deactivate the mother worlds execution device without ever seeing it and the end of the first part is so copied from star wars revenge of the sith that its embarrassing if you want to have a nice evening with an exciting film you should rather go back to one of the originals that rebel moon was inspired by
Dec 23 2023,negative,he had dialogues with zero subtext all exposition a useless amount of slowmotion that borders the ridiculous and characters with zero depth expecially the protagonist the only good thing is the cgi
Dec 23 2023,negative,another overhyped copy and paste movie borrow everything from everywhere and hope that something will stick steal the plot from seven samurai mix in a healthy dose of star wars
Dec 23 2023,positive,rebel moon is definitely a good movie far from perfect but nowadays we should get our wins whenever we can    the story is simple perhaps a little too simple and it doesnt dodges the typical cliches seen in this genre of movies but we can see the potential of this world that zack synder has created    overall character performances were good and some even very good unfortunately the performance of the main character kora sophia boutella is not amongst them i had hoped she had grown more as an actress but it seems clear she will not be growing beyond what she has already shown in the past  and its a shame really seeing her character played perhaps by another actress like lets say emily blunt wouldve really shined and couldve perhaps been the creation of quite an important character within the scifi genre  i understand why sophia boutella was chosen for this role her dancing skills really come through in the action scenes but its her ability to show deeper levels of emotion that are lacking and for her character thats also a vital part    rebel moon hasnt done anything groundbreaking or revolutionary but its still a solid movie same as the story might seem too simplistic to some to others it seems to go over their heads some negative critics about it are not only unwarranted but a little petty as if they were expecting this movie to be what star wars or alien were in their beginning  when even star wars and alien cant reproduce their winning formula    dont go into this movie with too much expectations and will surprise you in a good way go into thinking it will be groundbreaking within the genre and youll obviously be disappointed  rebel moon has potential and its a good addition to the genre but it doesnt do anything that cant be expected from a good scifi movie and thats already quite an achievement considering how little in terms of good scifi movies we really get    at least rebel moon doesnt promise to shoot for the moon only to fall in a few meters
Dec 23 2023,positive,yes it is very cheesy in places but i really enjoyed it  i felt the first half was probably a bit slower than the rest but the ending had a far different pace  the action sequences were not bad that acting was good but man the script is  not so great  i get the feeling that part 2 might even things out more  just remember the original star wars had some terrible reviews and now is regarded as a true classic
Dec 23 2023,positive,the backstory is pretty long but all the fighting scene all amazing
Dec 23 2023,negative,there is a reason they say show not tell this was all tales of the achievements of characters that we barely get to see come together just a linear pageant with the last participant dying to try and fail at making an emotional impact i couldnt get past the visual effects and stylisation copied from warhammer 40k universe
Dec 23 2023,positive,of course its derivative we knew it was a gritty star wars meets  seven samurai but the execution is in general good the action is fun and the visuals dazzling the plot manages to do decent world building at a brisk pace keeping exposition to a minimum necessary letting its derivative natures fill on the gaps for the audience this first act is about assembling a team of interesting rogues giving them a thin mostly implicit backstory and setting up the second act their battle against unsurmountable odds to defend the little guy the acting is ok it lacks any memorable performances the climatic fight scene stretches logic a bit in true star wars style only the good guys have good aim and come out on top after being restrained and surrounded by enemy troops still it manages to be fun and exciting
Dec 23 2023,negative,storyline weak characters show little to no charisma part two has a lot of ground to make up
Dec 23 2023,negative,after stealing from other movies seven samurai star wars prisoner of azkaban etc introducing us more and more boring characters with zero personalities and filling the screen with poor unfinished video game graphics rebel moon dares to end with end of part one text thinking id be interested to watch part two
Dec 23 2023,neutral,visually exciting this movie could be plucked right out of the established starwars universe but the story line is hollow and dull leaving you with a sense of sadness and longing for cinema that actually attempted to excite you with new and original ideas you can easily predict each  plot point as it unfolds like a wet blanket this is all just copy and paste much the same as the recent star wars franchise as the first part of a trilogy this film attempts to build up anticipation for the subsequent films however i anticipate diminishing viewership for each subsequent part so much squandered potential
Dec 23 2023,positive,not perfect but very beautiful and interesting and i need more exploration
Dec 23 2023,positive,movie was great cant wait for part 2  great visuals and story and zs style slowmo action sequences were awesome
Dec 23 2023,positive,this reminds me of the magnificant seven in space  just enough backstorey to move the storey along great villian without the im just misunderstood rubish backstorey fantastic imagery  if you are looking for a oscar nomination look elsewhere  if you want entertainment and escapism you could do a lot worse
Dec 23 2023,positive,rebel moon is a scifi film that may appeal to fans of the genre a masterpiece
Dec 23 2023,negative,bro has zero sense for a good scriptas always the visuals are on point tho
Dec 23 2023,positive,good movie no serious
Dec 23 2023,negative,no investment in the characters at all slow motion overdone editing all over the place yep dont care for another cut or the sequel
Dec 23 2023,positive,while it has its narrative flaws and the characters could use a bit more fleshing out as a stand alone film it is enjoyable as the first part in a larger story i am looking forward to seeing more
Dec 23 2023,positive,its hard to believe for around 80m this film was made with all the visuals and sets etc    good film from start to finish apparently their is a directors cut expected soon which is even better    definitely worth a watch as it sets up its own universe
Dec 23 2023,positive,i absolutely loved it that is a really weird universe  the almost video game like cgi and simple and yes predictable story got me hooked its a nice visual show that its not a high end disney production well we all know how those manege to astonish us recently i watched all in marvel universe masterpieces and wow cant really remember the story general feel of suck this one is definitively different may be this is its appeal and yes its heavy on cliche but its fun something i did not experience for a long time now cant wait for part two if they make tv show out of this then great initially i thought its going to be anyway so bring it please
Dec 23 2023,positive,good story   i bit like starwars a bit like dune   how science fiction should be   cant wait for the next movie
Dec 23 2023,positive,i dont understand the negative critic reviews they need to lighten up and enjoy it for what it is all in a really solid and enjoyable movie
Dec 23 2023,positive,i am a massive star wars dune blade runner and scifi fan and i really enjoyed it the plot is simple but star wars was too in 1977 yes it pulls from all of the above and 7 samurai and and but its a great 2 hour romp through space and will keep you and the kids entertained over christmas i agree with comments about the characters lacking depth but i am already looking forward to part 2 in april bring it on cinema doesnt have to be complex to be enjoyable
Dec 23 2023,negative,its just seven samarai which has already been adapted to way better futuristic versions
Dec 23 2023,negative,dire have you ever wanted to see a really boring and bleak remake of star wars this movie is for you
Dec 23 2023,neutral,odd movie star war nazis vs heroine  it passed the time but a forgettable movie
Dec 23 2023,positive,better than expected very interesting universe ed skrein and charlie hunnam steal the show damn good movie
Dec 23 2023,positive,the 7 samuray in space thats all  nothing new or original
Dec 23 2023,positive,it really is a great movie with a star wars feel however the ending has no ending feel and leaves you disappointed theres nothing left to see id recommend not watching until all released if its a trilogy im guessing the second will be the same
Dec 23 2023,positive,we need more adult themed scifi films this was fun for what it was some great visuals say what you want about zack but he swings for the fences
Dec 23 2023,negative,one of the worst scifi i have ever seen
Dec 23 2023,negative,i did watch the whole thing not because i enjoyed but because i was curious if each would keep getting worse and if it did how deep could it sink turns out it did and it did indeed end up on the bottom of any reasonable scale with very few exceptions the characters are onedimensional caricatures that are impossible to connect to and the whole scifi part looks cheap with space ships looking as if they have been taken out from a 1998 computer game    what always amazes me with multi million dollar productions like this  why do they even start with scripts as bad as this they could have given that script to anyone on the street and they could have pointed out the stupidity or is the stupidity intentional       this movie is a waste of time maybe that is all we need waste time
Dec 23 2023,positive,rebel moon was enjoyable and although not perfect if you like sci fi thats abit different you will enjoy this
Dec 23 2023,negative,this is a great movie to fall asleep   i really enjoyed my nap while watching this
Dec 23 2023,positive,ok critics and haters yes its highly derivative but ive been reading and watching scifi and fantasy since i was about 8so thats over 60 years  and you know what if it pays homage to and builds upon past works as many other movies before it have not even half as well as long as its as stunningly beautiful as this with a terrific cast of actors directed well and obviously invested and giving it their all then so what  if i have one small minor quibble its that the slomo in some of the action scenes sometimes seems unnecessary and just dated but final verdict for any lover of space opera moviessit back and enjoyi certainly did  
Dec 23 2023,positive,absolutely loved it  and im critical of weak scifi movies  the story was inspired  the acting was fair  at least as good as the best star wars movies the villain was good and hateable  the special effects were top notch  great movie in a weak year for movies   cant wait for part 2  ignore the critics  it was more fun than dune
Dec 23 2023,negative,the worst scifi film ive seen in my life i was confident after seeing justice league though  the photography is sometimes barely worthy of a bad pc game  i dont know what happened but stop immediately dont release the rest its useless
Dec 23 2023,positive,immersive and thrilling rebel moon offers an experience that seamlessly blends futuristic visuals with heartpounding action sequences the narrative is simple yet captivating transporting the audience to new and fascinating worlds the choreographed action scenes are visually spectacular and serve to drive the plot keeping the audience on the edge of their seats from start to finish the pacing is expertly handled ensuring an exciting and thoroughly enjoyable journey
Dec 23 2023,positive,im not saying rebel moon is better than star wars ok  i am why  the gore of battle  star wars is cute in comparison
Dec 23 2023,negative,i found the plot derivative the characters superficial the dialogue inane and the stereotypes numbingall wastes of the actors and vfx artists talents i was very excited when i first saw rebel moon advertised but now i just feel sad
Dec 23 2023,positive,i have no idea how people correlate this to star wars why because it is set in space what the heck zero semblance  i saw it ore similar to warhammer 40k the astra militarum are the bad guys as far as outfits go primarily  the film itself is pretty good in story and has a lot of nice battle scene the slow motions happen a bit too much i look forward to part 2  hopefully the similar to star wars commenters can get off their delusional band wagons
Dec 23 2023,negative,truly atrocious only worth your time if you are studying film and trying to learn how not to do it
Dec 23 2023,positive,i honestly think this movie deserved a 35 or maybe a 4 but decided to give it a little bit more because of the douchebag critics who are just completely out of touch with an entertaining movie    yes its not going down as one of the best films of all time but its not trying to be    looking forward to pt 2 and honestly hoping that they develop a tv series spinoff to really flush out the universe theyve created
Dec 23 2023,positive,a enjoyable film that took a little from every famous syfy movie from the past
Dec 23 2023,negative,its a hard nope from me couldnt finish it
Dec 23 2023,negative,i have seen some good story telling movies this was not it also not once was i remotely emotionally engaged
Dec 23 2023,negative,the story line was so boring and predictable i also didnt like the violence without the blood not that it needs to be gory it was just very disney the cinematography was awesome also the blurred edge effect made me keep questioning if something was wrong with my screen you could tell it was originally written to be pitched as a star wars movie and the edited after it was rejected
Dec 23 2023,negative,technically excellent story weak boring very disappointing
Dec 23 2023,positive,dont listen to the critics we all have different perspectives and lenses we view the world from it is a good movie and i cant wait for part 2 im sure some will love and some will not what a boring world it would be if we were all the same if you like sifi like star wars and dune you will love it happy watching
Dec 23 2023,positive,stunning art style and vfx it had many elements from popular sci and fantasy but puts a unique spin in it all cant wait for part 2
Dec 23 2023,positive,it was an entertaining movie the story line was good i cant wait for part 2
Dec 23 2023,positive,good movie many action excelent
Dec 23 2023,positive,exciting plots amazing visuals massive world building eagerly waiting for part 2
Dec 23 2023,positive,rebel moon is a pretty decent scifi fantasy it has a touch of grimdark with some decent action it is lacking in the action department when compared to snyders usual films but the story though cliché in some ways is satisfying  considering the budget the visuals are mostly stellar and the dialog and drama are on par with most scifi epics my only major issue is the fact that this film is clearly a part one and feels incomplete   sophia boutella is a certified action star and does a good job as the lead antagonist  do yourself a favor and check  this one out
Dec 23 2023,positive,although the story has been told before you get to see it with in a fresh new way i loved the characters and storyline and cant wait to see more of it give it a shot
Dec 23 2023,positive,the man does it again this was amazing part 2 will be even better
Dec 23 2023,positive,derivative lacking any real character development and crowded with lazy exposition of an underdeveloped universe but it was fun to watch
Dec 23 2023,negative, 1610      i like the part were the kayaiii tentacle monster sucks that walmart cillian murphy space nazis tit just like suicide squad 2016 nobody does anything and its so annoying almost like its multiple movie ideas showed in one its so bad  the main characters backstory was actually good should have been the actual film the worlds in here look cool but are wasted each character gets a intro and each one is so bad and funny i really dont care about any character at all in here except the robot that dose literally nothing and the villain thats just has a certain presence also go read nightendays review ill put the link in the comments grade d
Dec 23 2023,positive,rebel moon  part one a child of fire feels like a lackluster star wars copy dedicating too much time to introducing numerous characters nonetheless its still overall entertaining with impressive visuals
Dec 23 2023,positive,i liked it and the set pieces the story was simple but effective and i feel there is far more to it which will be explored in part 2 the important thing is delivered in what it promised entertainment and fun building a new universe is not easy and rebel moon delivered dont care what the critics have said i never do anymore they have been just pompous and abstract and i find most people dont care about their options anymore
Dec 23 2023,positive,i am a hude fan of zack synders story telling however after watching rebel moon i felt like watching a prolog of a series and i was unable to connect with the movie few things are good about the movie     however it cant save this movie    sophies potreal was like lifeless and emotionless character    charlies character doesnt impact anything    good things about the movie    roys and anthonys character i was directly related and was able to connect    i liked eds negative character    few slows are very bad and does not make sense    i really like the entry and fisrt flight of starz scenes and slow mo    however my favourite movies will remain same    bvs zsjl mos    i hope zynders storytelling and half baked polt issues are fixed in next chapter rebel moon scargiver
Dec 23 2023,negative,wtf is this i stopped after 50 minutes he put everything you have in the scifi genre into one movie from harry potter to star wars passing by the hobbiton and it looks like a b movie what was the budget the original blade runner movie has better special effects than this   and its really slow and boring hes lucky rebel moon isnt showed in the theatres
Dec 23 2023,negative,maybe as a series it would have stood a chance but this was just god awful  boring obscenely predictable unoriginal and the acting just sucked  i really dont have very high standards for movies i like ive watched jupiter ascending more than once but this was worse than john carter
Dec 23 2023,negative,its like a star wars wannabe  failing at almost everything
Dec 23 2023,positive,great film from start to end develops characters doesnt overwhelm you and really good story line so far
Dec 23 2023,negative,this was awful the writing was terrible the plot made no sense these user reviews have to be fake why would riding a hippogryph tame it why would there be a hippogryph in a scifi movie why would you want connan the barbarian to help you fight space marines i dont even think he did anything other than waste 30 min of the movie worst movie i have seen in years
Dec 23 2023,positive,do you enjoy a good action movie with great visuals a story told but gripping none the less something to just watch and enjoy great scifi if you enjoy that kind of thing just a cool and entertaining watch if you looking for a movie where you want to pick out references to a bunch of amazing movies that have been made a reminder of great movies you might of seen theres that to
Dec 23 2023,neutral,rebel moon hit the hype train hard but missed the destination    spoiler its going pretty well a superb open narrative delivered by anthony hopkins its building our empathy right up to the point a villager is saved from sexual assault  its from this point on that it goes on its magnificent 7 quest that  well it becomes devoid of script any indication of amount of time passing        i can tell you theres a cora a general titus and some other people in it who dont like the status quo but you just dont really care to know because their back storys are delivered in perhaps 2 lines of script thats the core problem you just dont care about the charactersbecause you dont know them     a very personal issue is an aesthetic what the hell were they thinking with the primary antagonists hair cut no wonder hes more than a little narky every single reflective element in the world tells him he looks a right plonker    theres lots of borrowing from other scifi universes like 40k dune star wars firefly john carter but what we get served from this mixed dish is ever so slightly underwhelming it passes a few hours its mildly entertaining    over all youre left asking    what the hell is the mechanica military thing doing as the film closes
Dec 23 2023,positive,movie did not nearly live up to hype story was very formulaic visual effects were great but not enough to save
Dec 23 2023,positive,not a new story but great visual and sound effects
Dec 23 2023,negative,lame again like a lamer avatar but they didnt have to gingerly touch tails but lots of slow mow
Dec 23 2023,negative,more battlefield earth than dune
Dec 23 2023,positive,borrowing from several genres this film is actually quite entertaining  i look forward to part two far more than any disney show course this isnt saying much with disney currently and the lack of compelling content  well worth watching rebel moon and great work zack
Dec 23 2023,positive,if dunes little brother is starwars this is surely their little sister its in the family could have been better the female lead was good but not exactly my cupotea although she fit the bill the story is there but needed a little more time spent on the backstory it seemed worth it the action is good dialog is lacking which effects the character humor  depth and some regular conversation would be nice   the writers on this need help the lack of quality dialogue and character development might be attributed to the writers union stand off but all in all it was a b film more character development back story and dialogue and youre looking at blockbuster
Dec 23 2023,neutral,i cant cope with this much slow motion literally every action scene
Dec 23 2023,negative,you can always tell what kind of movie youre in for when people around it start calling it the next star wars    usually a terrible one maybe they meant the next book of boba fett    what a poorly written muddily filmed ill considered over acted tedious waste of two hours at least i can skip the second part
Dec 23 2023,negative,the 12 star is for charlie hunnam who although totally wasted in his role here always gets something from me absolutely dreadful movie for the enormous cost spent that could have fed a beleaguered village or 5 for a few years
Dec 23 2023,positive,it a good sifi movie nice to see a new cool univers cant wait for the next one 
Dec 23 2023,negative,throwing every scifi movie to the wall and seeing what sticks with money as the paste doesnt make a movie good
Dec 23 2023,positive,everything everyone has said that is bad is absolutely true and at the same time all that has been said about it being good is also right   im split down the middle i pray   and pray and again    part  two will be better and  i know the movie afforded humans jobs so i will support consider it a introduction   as a audience were too spoiled to be fooled with lots of greenscence and slow cinematic shots that sometimes dont seem to connect even the female eye candy mood was not there  
Dec 23 2023,negative,seemed stuck in a rut of repeating character introductions with obligatory action sequences has potential its inspired but the notions havent been well worked into an interesting story
Dec 23 2023,negative,this is soo bad the action scenes make no sense whatsoever bad guys are once again a mix of nazis and storm troopers they always miss  lines are cheesy acting is mediocre plot twists can be seen a mile away  save your time
Dec 23 2023,negative,zs needs to stop so many lazy tropes stolen storylines he should never write again visually some parts are stunning but most of the story is cliched and boring characters arent developed and you can totally see what his star wars pitch failed if this was it he should work with great writers and producers in the future and never try to story tell
Dec 23 2023,positive,i found the movie fun to watch it for sure is a set up for multiple films   i think the critics are not on point on this one and its worth the watch and i cant wait for part 2
Dec 23 2023,positive,i thought it was brilliant i honestly do not understand the hate this movie is getting
Dec 23 2023,positive,i dont understand why critics didnt like this flick  its visually stunning every scene well thought out and portrayed  the story is building as this is only part one so you must consider that when watching and immersing yourself into this beautiful film
Dec 23 2023,negative,dont believe the liars saying rebel moon is good this is the worst garbage ever put on film ed wood level trash without the charming fun or any kind of fun     its really bad and there are so many better uses of your time clean your ears or finally trim that hangnail youll get more entertainment from it
Dec 23 2023,negative,a hodgepodge of absolute garbage can you not be original with the characters or storytelling the parallels with other movies was overly predictable and disappointing to say the least
Dec 23 2023,positive,very entertaining movie what a work of art must watch 
Dec 23 2023,positive,visually stunning wonderfully paced well acted this movie was a blast and creative direction sets it apart from the movies it may have taken inspiration from
Dec 23 2023,positive,criminally underated for the first new scifi franchise in a decade  beautifully shot and an exciting intro and origin story for the main character who are all likeable  i only didnt give it a fifth star because im scared to death the second part wont do justice to the first
Dec 23 2023,positive,nowhere near as original as the creator this is the most rousing scifi popcorn movie since alita battle angel or the last star wars movie and at a fraction of the cost  i do see the negative pro reviews  what i believe they miss is the need blockbuster movies work best by staying close to familiar archetypes and archetypal themes  the quality has to mostly come from the commitment and dedication in front of and behind the camera  nothing cheap here at all  rebel moon has mountains of commitment and dedication so it works to engage audiences  if you need more originality go see the creator
Dec 23 2023,negative,they ended the writers strike for this
Dec 23 2023,negative,looked promising then the story is all over the place there are so many dramatic moments with characters i know little so i dont care about any of them wouldve been better if it was a tv show
Dec 23 2023,positive,excellent visuals good plot ready for part 2
Dec 23 2023,positive,sat and watched this with my wife  we both loved it i am a huge science fiction fan she is not   comparing the critic scores to the audience scores show unequivocally that critics have no clue what makes a good movie    this film was fun to watch and i am looking forward to part 2 next year
Dec 23 2023,positive,visually stunning  storytelling was bit slow but i enjoyed every action of it cant wait for part 2  zacktivated all along
Dec 23 2023,positive,loved the visual aesthetic of the worlds and characters  certain characters get far more focus on them than others which is a bummer for an ensemble flick but its set up more like this would be the first half hour of lets get the crew together parts of movies spread into a 2 hour film serring up the sequel which as shown in the trailer that plays after the movie ends all those issues will be covered in the next film it seems  this would be a bigger issue if the next movie didnt come out in just a few short months but here it just feels like part 1 of a tv special opening up a whole new universe id love to see more of  its like if star wars warhammer 40k and seven samurai had a baby and im here for it
Dec 23 2023,neutral,lost interest about an hour in  we are going to tope an empire by recruiting 6 people huh boring
Dec 23 2023,negative,it would have been nice to hear what people were saying without the sound effect destroying my hearing
Dec 23 2023,negative,thin characters incoherent story  hilariously cringe dialogue some decent visuals sometimes though
Dec 23 2023,negative,a big budget and decent cast completely wasted on what feels like an amateur director with a rich dad  there is little point to so much of this first installment the energy put into this production would have been better spent on a project like firefly or cowboy bebop where writing and characters stayed core to the focus  there was room for subtly within the grand adventure but it was reduced to obvious and overstated sentiments and violence without consequence  very poor
Dec 23 2023,positive,this movie was a lot of fun the visual style was just breathtaking and was just a fun action packed adventure story
Dec 23 2023,neutral,1 hr 25 min in of a 2 hr and 4 min movie and i feel no connection whatsoever to any of the characters no connection at all to any even at least one character definitely makes it a struggle to watch  the visuals are great but the story and pace struggle and fails to grab much less keep my attention sofia boutellas acting just not believable i see why she doesnt have many lines in other movies the trailer will trick you you cant get this time back i was really excited to watch this one was
Dec 23 2023,negative,so many of the action sequences are slowmotion gratuitous wastes of screen time  they would be more interesting at full speed than slowmotion but even then theyre unnecessary    there are such gaping plot holes like people who claim to fight for honor and then betray their ideals for no apparent reason      and has no one in this universe ever heard of a radio
Dec 23 2023,negative,what a load a shite
Dec 23 2023,positive,not the best movie but i like it and i want to see next parts
Dec 23 2023,positive,whoever these critics are its bs they can say the movie is not well recieved when audience score is way greater than critics it shows biase the movie graphics cgi and storyline is perfect everyone plays their part perfectly
Dec 23 2023,positive,full of fantastic visuals excellent world building and epic storytelling i cant wait to watch the sequels and see how the story progresses
Dec 23 2023,positive,ive seen the complaints of the critics i can see the slight indications of what they say overall it was great i think the critics are working too hard and watching too many moviesshows they lack the pure joy of a wellmade movie despite the symptoms repeated in other movies
Dec 23 2023,positive,this film was a story of an epic adventure a story of redemption sacrifice and most of all revenge it was at times breathtakingly emotional but the action and fighting sequences were the most resounding i really enjoyed it and i cant wait to see part 2
Dec 23 2023,positive,the movie has a good history and amazing screenshots
Dec 23 2023,negative,wow that was bad
Dec 23 2023,positive,i really enjoyed it
Dec 23 2023,negative,wasnt bad but wasnt really good   had to pause it three times to figure out how much time was left in the movie just felt so exhausting to watch it felt like a chore it sit though it all for a sci fi film was kinda boring  to many characters with to much backstoryfelt confusing at times
Dec 23 2023,negative,not a very creative movie predictable from beginning to end
Dec 23 2023,negative,looks so expensive and at the same time so cheap what a medicre movie
Dec 23 2023,positive,it was really cool finally some new stuff cant wait for the sequels and ratedr version
Dec 23 2023,negative,this movie is hot garbage there might be some interesting visuals sure but the story is trash the acting is mediocre and it watches like no one continuity checked the script this seems like fodder for someone to tear apart on youtube as a trash film
Dec 23 2023,positive,an amazing movie i cant wait for part two revolutionary storyline a for originality one bad ass movie
Dec 23 2023,negative,starts off interesting but slowly wears you down as the movie goes on the dialog was terrible the characters are super shallow characters who are basically just names along with a trope the action was fine but not worth having to watch the non action parts i wanted to like it but it was just a really bad movie
Dec 23 2023,positive,the universe in this movie is darker more interesting and scarier than the star wars universe  though the characters arent as charismatic i disagree with the critics its a story rich with potential
Dec 23 2023,positive,i believe everyone has become so super critical that the ability to simply enjoy a well done movie is almost lost this movie was visually pleasing from the opening scene to closing ive heard that the pacing was either to slow or to fast i on the other hand didnt have an issue because as i stated i watched for enjoyment not as a critic the acting and character development was exactly what was to be expected from a movie building a new universe and franchise if you go into this movie to enjoy a good movie you will be pleased with any movie even your favorite movie if you go in with the idea to pick apart anything you dont like then no movie will ever meet your standards this was written by a fan of cinema not a critic 
Dec 23 2023,negative,uninteresting or compelling characters or story everything looks very cool but lacks any depth that makes it interesting
Dec 23 2023,negative,rushed with very little character development and barely any storytelling
Dec 23 2023,negative,no character building no creativity predictable and zero redeemable qualities it leaves no reason for even caring about a sequel all the budget went to being visually entertaining but the dialogue was sooooo weak epic bad i had to apologize to others for asking to watch it
Dec 23 2023,positive,i quite enjoyed the movie i can definitely see how this could have been a star wars movie changing out some characters for others such as general titan for mac windu or prince tarak for luke while not the main characters in the film they are still important ones im looking forward to part ii there was some parts of the movie that seemed likely or obvious but itt is still enjoyable if you like sci fi
Dec 23 2023,positive,great movie very enjoyable to watch and entertaining
Dec 23 2023,positive,very good excited to see where this new universe goes
Dec 23 2023,positive,was a entertaining movie overall had fun watching the new worlds and action was fun just a bit that the antagonist needed more beating lol
Dec 23 2023,positive,very enjoyable zach synder movie expect slow mos for sure but characters looked kool action was dope love the sci fi setting world seems big and interesting cant wait for sequel to expand on italot of people saying they cant follow the story or we dont know enough about these characters and thats kinda lame cuz story was very basic bad empire threaten village and protagonist goes on quest to find help to fight back sound like a video game which i love and easy to follow and movie was made to tease at things to come because its obviously a series so i thought it was done fine to peek my interest to learn and see more in future
Dec 23 2023,neutral,its battle beyond the stars meets warhammer very amateurish writing with barely enough character development to understand why any of these heroes are willing to risk their lives fighting for a people nearly none of them have any ties to it has incredible visual effects but cg does not turn a bland film into an epic
Dec 23 2023,negative,the first half is star wars episode 4 the second half is akira kurosawa 7 samurai and in not a good way you have picky nazi blinder as the main villain a lot of edgy dialogue and no chemistry at all betwen the characters aside kora i couldnt remember any of the others characters names and its only because it sounds very familiar to korra absolute scifi garbage at least it has some decent visual moments
Dec 23 2023,positive,has action and fulfills its role of entertaining
Dec 23 2023,positive,not a single thing i didnt like really not sure why it has such poor critic reviews
Dec 23 2023,neutral,after watching this this movie has nothing but exposition dump the visual were impressive so much slomo unnecessary slomo scene like characters doing normal activities as throwing seeds creatures look cool story was bland not enough time to get to know each characters we were introduced to im curious for part 2 and directors cut for part 1
Dec 23 2023,positive,i really like the movie i can not wait for the second part and and the directors cut but i recommend it
Dec 23 2023,positive,its big and bombastic and wears its influences on its sleeves i was left wanting much more
Dec 23 2023,negative,starts well but quickly falls off once the team building starts visually impressive moments but the plot     im convinced if they removed all the slow motion action moments buckle up there are a ton to the point it becomes comical this would be a 90 minute film
Dec 23 2023,neutral,i watched it with low expectations i think that worked in its favor although its still unsatisfactory its a stumbling movie that doesnt quite know how to structure the story it wants to tell and it simply manages by ellipses and flashbacks inserted inorganically to try to drive the entire story behind it a little all the interactions between characters are lost and in the end you dont care about them the best thing that can be said about this movie is that it doesnt make you feel like youve wasted your time but it doesnt evoke any emotion you feel nothing once its over it just ends with the announcement of a second part lets hope it doesnt disappoint us like this
Dec 23 2023,negative,this was the worst movie i have seen in a long long time i cant remember a movie off the top of my head that was as trashy as this the graphics look like a low budget video game the acting was shockingly bad and its basically like watching a bunch of loosely woven vignettes with o my the barest hint of unifying story if they cut out the endless gratuitous slow motion scenes it would have shaved about thirty minutes off the movie it is a poor ripoff of star wars and was utterly abysmal no redeeming qualities if you value your time skip it
Dec 23 2023,positive,good job setting up the future i think it will all come together in the end he has a vision
Dec 23 2023,positive,i thought it was pretty good it was a bit slow to start and maybe i was a little to excited for it to come out so i expected like  best movie ever status it was not quite there for me  worth the watch for sure
Dec 23 2023,positive,fantastic scifi with an old western type story anbout assembling a team of badasses to fight off the bad guys dazzling special effects and plenty of laser blast action completely enjoyable
Dec 23 2023,negative,way too slow not much character development to even be invested in their outcome overall pretty disappointing
Dec 23 2023,positive,its not winning any oscars but will definitely watch again and excited for part two hit a lot of nostalgia for me of bygone scifi of the 70s and 80s
Dec 23 2023,positive,honestly this movie is phenomenal such a great start to what appears to be a great collection coming soon a rebel moon fan emerged today and this the first time in my life i have taken the time to write a review
Dec 23 2023,positive,fun flick looked great enjoyed the story looking forward to part 2
Dec 23 2023,positive,this movie is a lot of fun amazing visuals and great actionfight scenes really cool story that leaves you wanting more
Dec 23 2023,positive,i want more great start
Dec 23 2023,positive,i enjoyed the movie i am looking forward to seeing the longer version     this was shot almost completely on green screen with cgi for pretty much everything     i agree it has overtones of many different ideas   nazis   vikings  amish  star wars  farscape  babylon 5  and much more     realize that considering the restrictions placed on him for the movie its better than i expected  i look forward to the next two movies and then the director cuts for all three which i suspect considering sniders other directors cuts will be even better     give it a chance and realize if your looking for award winning movie this is not it   if your looking for an enjoyable movie that is definitely different and is trying to do much more with a lot less like farscape and babylon 5 then i suspect you may enjoy this
Dec 23 2023,positive,the critics are missing out on this movie the plot is the predictable retold story of the rebellion against another evil empire but the characters of the rebellion  and their quest for help are as entertaining as the first viewing of star wars its refreshing and captures your imagination again life repetes itself often so dont let the critics tell you this story cant be told again its a cool movie and if you love syfy you will love this
Dec 23 2023,negative,so the visuals and armor made me think this was an mmo adaptation turns out no it just looks straight of wow or even runescape the characters are characterless the people are literally as one dimensional caricatures the fight choreography is hilariously awful im shocked this exists honestly
Dec 23 2023,neutral,i cant get past the fact that the story line is almost exact like the movie a bugs life mixed with a little star wars  fun and entertaining but same story
Dec 23 2023,positive,finally a show that takes syfy and star wars making a story you can engage in and feel like yes 
Dec 23 2023,negative,such a wasted premise  so much time spent on slow motion and super slow motion that would have been better used for actual character and plot development  the entire plot is collecting the party of people to fight the evil empire  but they dont have ships  it doesnt make sense  one character cautions the dangers of revenge and the very next character collection is motivated by how about revenge  how does something this bad get made
Dec 23 2023,neutral,visually nice storyline very basic
Dec 23 2023,negative,the storyline of movie is so predictable offering nothing fresh or engaging    
Dec 23 2023,negative,absolutely awful nothing redeeming cgi is bad story is bad acting is bad just terrible
Dec 23 2023,positive,a fun movie lots of action and yes it borrowed from so many other movies but if you love sci fi youll appreciate it if you arent a pretentious knob and miss the good old days of movies that were actually entertaining then i guarantee youll love this cant wait for part 2
Dec 23 2023,positive,i really enjoyed the movie and cant wait for the rated r cut
Dec 23 2023,positive,entertaining expansive good cast looks great to watch and has its own twists on expected genre themes and characters a fun scifi adventure thats worth a first and repeat watch
Dec 23 2023,negative,no character building interesting premise but they butchered the execution those are 2 hours im not getting back
Dec 23 2023,negative,it was like a poorly reimagined warhammer 40k the soldiers look like knock off imperial guard the slayed king just basically feels like the dead emperor guns look just like bolters i mean its a blatant rip off and a garbage one at that dialog is just poorly written the protagonist is probably the worst of everyones  the action is horrible dont use axes and knives if you arent going to blood or wounds it just look like practice sessions the guns arent build right and the again the protagonist can barely hold it without it wobbling all over the place this is just the first half the just filled with cliches and tropes that are already over used and mashed together is such a dull way this director needs to stay away from the writing waste of two hours
Dec 23 2023,positive,not perfect but i had a blast watching it
Dec 23 2023,positive,waited a year to watch rebel moon  a child of fire instead recieved a updated version of battle beyond the stars with a few more grunts  despite this comparison there were some good character development fast pace action and sofia boutella did an amazing job as did ed skrein
Dec 23 2023,negative,a river of ponderous overwrought cgi wrapped around the same dull poor little ai robots trope that made creator so monotonous watching it felt like being forcefed talking points by openais marketing department
Dec 23 2023,positive,loved it the opening scene was eye candy the battles were epic and the story twist was exactly what i wanted i have theories about kora and the but i wont spoil it for other
Dec 23 2023,positive,amazing  cant wait for directors cut
Dec 23 2023,positive,it was a good movie great cast and action sure it has its faults lots of plot armor for main characters and some inexplicable moments in general but id like to see more of this universe very much warhammer 40k meets star wars awesome designs for ships armor weapons and planets needs to be fleshed out more but this was a good start strong female lead not some damsel in distress the whole cast needs to be more expressive though i know now they are trying to be under the radar but it would be better to see them being more active backstory would have been a better place to start for the main and some support characters but a fun watch nonetheless and a visual treat i would have like to see more from jimmy but i guess most of that was cut   i hope they spend more time laying out the history of this galaxy and maybe why the king was slain to put things into perspective it seems like there was so much more that led into this situation in the film that was not expounded upon that it becomes muddled was the original empire good or bad what was the struggle initially i have a lot of questions but hopefully they can be answered in the future in filmseries formats comic tieins seem lazy to me for exposition do a book if needed
Dec 23 2023,positive,movie was really good enjoyed it im not like everyone whose only concern is visual effects and looking for every tiny or unnoticeable movie detail flaws it was entertaining and amazing enjoyable movie for me
Dec 23 2023,negative,it was as if chat bot wrote it  clear mishmosh assembly of tropescharacters recently reused ideas and imagery
Dec 23 2023,positive,cant wait to see how this story progresses
Dec 23 2023,neutral,a bit too much rampant plagiarism to be comfortable with or to forgive two and a half stars because its some scifi that is not marvel or disney
Dec 23 2023,positive,very entertaining 
Dec 23 2023,negative,it was extremely derivative and failed to make be believe the stakes in several scenes also the repeated use of sexual assault as a theme is kinda creepy
Dec 23 2023,positive,solid acting entertaining media critics are all wrong they would have given the original star wars a 10 if it came out today by the way they have reviewed this
Dec 23 2023,negative,i cant believe i watched this film for what felt like an eternity to see the worst parts of gladiator a new hope prisoner of azkaban and rip offs of warhammer 40k plowed into a confused and lack luster design style that felt good until it doesnt
Dec 23 2023,positive,okay i flat out loved this yes it borrows from so many sources and its far too easy to pick them out but i didnt care because it was just what i was in the mood for my subwoofer got quite the workout i dont know if there are scenes they cut for time but im sure a longer version would probably be even better but im happy with what we got
Dec 23 2023,negative,pretty much a mess story line was a joke dialogue was disappointing at best special effects were good but they should have saved some money to write a better script
Dec 23 2023,positive,a fun movie with good action a little slow to start but it picks up
Dec 23 2023,positive,if you like star wars and dune this is worth a watch
Dec 23 2023,positive,i watched the teaser for the first time and liked it i secretly think of the dun war and jupiter movie plus seven samurai plus warhammer 40k every inhabited planet has problems its fun to fight   ps i waiting director cut rate r 
Dec 23 2023,positive,its the beginning   im waiting for the long version
Dec 23 2023,negative,the whole thing felt sloppily put together there was no character development the characters spoke to each other like they had a history when they literally just met it was a big let down
Dec 23 2023,negative,dirt farmers with automatics doors on their homes but no modern tools  space nut sees i kid you not with no discipline  the whole thing simultaneously look cheap and super expensive all at the same time  welcome to rebel moon  also grabbing another man by the stick and balls in a sexual context when there is not consent is not funny or cool
Dec 23 2023,positive,looks great action is good writing and direction doesnt appear to have any direction or thought fun though
Dec 23 2023,negative,a real lack of any depth given other than a brief description of who they are to a rapidly introduced group of characters it started ok but soon became a rushed soulless movie leaving me without a care for any of the main characters let alone the bland done to death plot a real shame really could have been so much more
Dec 23 2023,positive,good movie my only complaint is that there isnt enough character development they assemble a team that took little convincing to join their cause and we dont learn a whole lot about them it otherwise had a good story nice action sequences cool world designs and i enjoyed the showmo moments im looking forward to part two
Dec 23 2023,negative,drama without context not worth the calories
Dec 23 2023,negative,good cast interesting premise no expenses spared with cgi and costume design but by the end of the 2 hour run time it all collapses under the weight of a poor screenplay  felt like a film student project that just ripped off existing movies and tried to cram so many things into two hours at the expense of any character or world building beyond a few lines of cheap exposition    it started out okay then started to feel bad and by the end i felt angry at giving up two hours of my life while at the same time i found myself laughing at how bad the last line uttered in the movie was    i enjoyed reading reviews of people thrashing this movie more than the movie itself at least
Dec 23 2023,positive,if you took star wars dune avatar harry potter maze runner hunger games and just about any scifi of the past 60 years and ripped out random tropes mixed with a tired and worn but tried and true plot of a rebel against an all controlling evil empire you have rebel moon visually interesting but marked by clear cgi shortcuts its worth a watch compared to whatever other unoriginal rehashed drivel is being produced lately
Dec 23 2023,positive,fun action good story there was a little bit of bad dialogue but overall great movie
Dec 23 2023,positive,the movie is a great scifi movie fun  entertaining and the cgi is excellent the story is well written and the actress and actors bring the story to life i know some wanted a r rated version but i think the pg13 version is really good its definitely a movie the family can enjoy together this is a cowboy star wars movie  like the original star wars a new hope had bad reviews but everyone loved the movie dont listen to the critics listen to the the audience
Dec 23 2023,negative,visually stunning but hollow film
Dec 23 2023,positive,a good science fiction beginning of a universe surprisingly entertaining and cant wait for the unrated version and part 2 of the story the only thing holding it back was the amount of slow motion used in every action scene but other than that is pretty good 
Dec 23 2023,positive,better than star wars
Dec 23 2023,positive,entertaining but nothing really original
Dec 23 2023,positive,its much better than what i thought casting was great 
Dec 23 2023,positive,star wars movies need these type of action scenes truly unique amazing fighting sequences zack never stops being creative with action scene and i cant get enough
Dec 23 2023,negative,my god come up with something original this is a battle beyond the stars remake
Dec 23 2023,positive,story is good  nice flow visually interesting and easy to follow
Dec 23 2023,positive,little slow to start but great action and special effects star wars meets 300
Dec 23 2023,negative,the most cringe dialog this side of xena warrior princess oh yeah the story sucks too sophomoric plot that is transparent and meandering
Dec 23 2023,positive,the truth about rebelmoon is that its okay not bad not great just okayslash somewhat good its sw with more violence and less fun 710
Dec 23 2023,positive,it was specifically written to be a star wars spinoff so if you dont expect some familiar aesthetic you just dont understand the spirit of things this film was terrific i never wanted it to end and i cant wait for part 2 yeah its dark and serious i like dark gritty this movie scratched a whole lot of itches
Dec 23 2023,negative,this thing is a mess a little entertaining nothing that stretches your brain
Dec 23 2023,positive,incredible movie possibly zack snyders best film yet incredible casting incredible story and im excited to see part two
Dec 23 2023,negative,lacking in internal consistency character depth and generally feels like it was make to tick boxes not be a cohesive story
Dec 23 2023,positive,based upon the critic reviews basically every single superhero movie with an origin story in the last 15 years should be one star  this is how a space opera starts it is exactly how it is supposed to be  i hope to see more
Dec 23 2023,positive,loves the shots in this movie  action was pretty epic as well  excited to see the next one
Dec 23 2023,positive,idk whats up with the rt score being 21 from starting off at a 9 thats kinda insane i thought this movie was awesome the story is a classic seven samuraiknights of the round table kind of team up movie to protect the planet veldt kora and gunnar set off in search of help and it takes off from there the pacing is a bit off in the middle of the movie and i feel like a lot of the extended cut will show what we missed out on but the first and third acts are the strongest the visuals were out of fucking hand the flashback scene when kora dives into her past was one of the best and i was just in awe of how this movie looked al there were establishing shots that were as epic as some in lord of the rings at times it felt inspired by a cronenberg movie with the alien and technology infused aliens jimmy the robot was also a great character and i cant wait to see what the extended rated r cut will show as well as part ii  the scargiver also not to forget is the sets costumes props vehicles were awesome junkie xls score complimented the movie so well and hit just right when it needed to i suggest watching and deciding for yourself but i think its a good movie with plenty of rewatchability
Dec 23 2023,negative,34 of this film was soooo slow and boring the fight scene in the village the scene against the spider and the end of the film were the best bits if you could call them that lucky that i gave it a two star rating adult version of starwars someone called thiswhat a jokeany of the starwars franchises is better than this i wouldnt waste you time or money watching this movie
Dec 23 2023,positive,fun exciting and engaging really enjoyed it
Dec 23 2023,negative,absolutely boring zero action weak story
Dec 23 2023,positive,i love that movie and the slow scenes i like the action and if you like the action you wont get bored i really love it
Dec 23 2023,positive,i thought it was great tbh  not as good as dune but way better than any star wars movie  ill be looing forward to part 2 dropping in 2024
Dec 23 2023,positive,visually outstanding but lacked a cohesive storyline would love much more back story on all the main characters im guessing if there is a directors cut everything will be fleshed out much more still very entertaining
Dec 23 2023,positive,watch it for yourself
Dec 23 2023,positive,this was one of the best movies this year i dont know why rottentomatoes criticism is so bad big l
Dec 23 2023,positive,i thought it was really good i read some reviews of people criticizing it but it was all petty it was one of the better movies i have seen in a while cant wait for the next part to come out
Dec 23 2023,negative,an absolute disaster of stolen storylines and over produced cgi
Dec 23 2023,positive,not sure if there are a lot of ai bots bombing the reviews as they all sound the same also im not sure why there are so many star wars references there are only seven story archetypes and yes they are both following similar tropes but so does any movie about the little guy fighting the big bad    the movie itself wasnt perfect but it was enjoyable to watch and worth recommending the characters are interesting and the action scenes were well done i will say it is the best scifi movie ive seen this year
Dec 23 2023,negative,i feel there was not a single original idea in this sucker punch of a film so many old earth accents and not a decent bit of dialogue to be heard it has a hobbit village a princess conan turns up and does nothing the greatest general of the age is found and spouts a couple of bad speeches and at one point jar jar is seen even the visuals are stolen the bad guys and their weapons are straight out of warhammer 40k and then the awful out of place ott music score is trying to punch above its weight another case of great trailer shame about the film    see if you can spot the stormtroopers who still cant hit anything and even the emperor makes an appearance lool
Dec 23 2023,positive,refreshing to see something from this genre not tied to star wars i know it was originally supposed to be but so glad they they took it in a different direction definitely recommend it to people who like scifi movies
Dec 23 2023,negative,the acting was horrible the characters are unimaginative its like a scifi knockoff of magnificent 7 remake such a fantastic cast but the story bored me to death had to push myself to finish the movie and not go watch something more interesting
Dec 23 2023,negative,wow we can discuss some of disneys questionable decisions about star wars  i really wanted to like this film but thank the maker for whoever at lucasfilmdisney passed on this really pedestrian movie  they made a very good decision  theres very little if anything new in this film near zero character development
Dec 23 2023,negative,every aspect about it is bad there is no character development it is a blunt copy of star wars and the dialogue is trash
Dec 23 2023,positive,star wars ripoff absolutely   worth watching absolutely some of the cgi was a little poor and some of the characters were a bit derivative pretty standard girl boss lead knocking ppl out with stick figure arms and female japanese character who uses swords to name a couple character development definitely lacking  for example who the hell is this general and why is he so angry no idea but overall it was visually engaging and had an extremely good villain along with solid action sequences    im excited to see the next in the series
Dec 23 2023,neutral,a somewhat middling movie it took a big shot and i felt it missed the net for the most part it tries to set up an appealing universe without providing nearly enough context or information there are a number of characters who just seem to do things not because they make sense but because the script wants them to     while visually pretty i feel like there was an over reliance on slow motion effects that took away from the film among other odd visual choices the main one that stood out to me involved a fight breaking out after a young girl is threatened with sa where there was a decent amount of unpleasantness surrounding what happens to the girl on screen to then transition to a fight scene involving axes and knives with not a single bit of blood nor wounds in sight     just an odd film that felt like it had certain points on a checklist it had to hit but not much else to it
Dec 23 2023,neutral,disappointed awkward dialogue poor pacing and cheesy fight sequences no feel of direction mildly entertaining but its really just another scifi rebellion movie but poorly executed on almost every aspect
Dec 23 2023,positive,this is a good version of 7 samurai in space it is visually stunning there was a seed for a great universe we were introduced to is something i cant wait to learn more about and i am more than interested in seeing how this universe expands as there are more movies comics books and more introduced
Dec 23 2023,positive,i liked the plot  storyline and awesome visuals but the movie lacked character development i am sure the r rated version will be much better  with more background on our heroes  the action is well filmed  but there isnt much action onscreen to keep you alert with that being said  this version had missing scenes and you can tell there isnt enough meet on the bone looking forward to seeing the uncut version soon 
Dec 23 2023,positive,this is theater quality i would be happy to pay for looking forward to the directors cut
Dec 23 2023,negative,its a basic movie with subpar acting the actors seemed to know this movie sucked it doesnt have the edge of your seat suspense it thinks it does the introduction of parts of the plot and character back stories is just thrown in and forced its not very smooth
Dec 23 2023,negative,its barely watchable
Dec 23 2023,positive,its warhammer 40k meets firefly meets sw i dig it  visuals are beautiful  story develops and is a good first step toward something cool critics  lol like the world actually cares what you say  usually if critics dont like it is a good watch rock on rebel moon
Dec 23 2023,positive,great movie ignore the critics
Dec 23 2023,positive,i think the idea of a critic has been lost surely a critic should judge anm movie so the potential audience can make an educated decision on whether to watch a movie based on an expert opinion but im seeing more and more disparity between audience scores and critic scores  if the two metrics are so far apart what is the point in the critic theyre obviously completely unaware of what the audience wants and basing their opinion on some other measure of entertainability   im starting to think that the critics are solely looking for artyfarty deep and meaningful artistic socially  real world questioning films which are inherently boring frustrating and completely missing the objective of cinema which is to escape the real world for 90 minutes not to be reminded of lifes stuggles and leave the cinema less depressed than when we arrive
Dec 23 2023,positive,amazing world creation visual vfx and the seven samurais vibe was really interesting therefore the directors cut and the sequel should fill the lack of character development of the movie aldo this doesnt prevent the movie from being a very competent and promising iteration very well settled up to the sequel
Dec 23 2023,positive,a great film with interesting characters and world although similar to other films in the style of big bad comes to small town small town seeks help this kept me tuned in right through and i wanted to find out more about the characters and the world they are in i loved the art style of the film although alot of reviews complained about the over use of slow motion i felt it suited the style and was used at the right moments to capture the feel this isnt fast and furious where its action over style and depth this is about style depth and visuals this is a great new film series where hopefully we see more world building
Dec 23 2023,negative,zs is good when directly adapting a story 300  watchmen yet still always has issues with pacing his movies when it comes to world building and making his own stories though hes really bad     this movie for example took him an hour to flesh out the premise took 30 mins to pick up new characters without any character backgrounds or motivations no chemistry or interactions between characters then all of a sudden theres the obvious and predictable betrayal and quick switch to climax     then theres the always dark world even when the suns up the world is still somehow dark also dont get me started with his addiction to slow motion which happens every ten seconds and in every flashback when theres absolutely no need for it
Dec 23 2023,negative,well any slower start and i would have thought this movie was about amish space farmers  secondly the pacing of the movie is trash  thirdly the script is horrendous     lets find warriors to fight a planetary army   and well start with you 4 clowns    this movie sucks
Dec 23 2023,positive,great vfx carefully crafted photography beautiful scenes and a very compelling story highly recomended
Dec 23 2023,negative,this is a movie that has a lot of buildup but leads you nowhere its a very typical great soldier that doesnt want to fight but is forced to story you can tell its inspired by stars wars it is a very predictable movie this movie is not good at all
Dec 23 2023,positive,a lot of people advertised this film as a star wars clone im a big scifistar wars fan and i can see its a very different world and storytelling to be honest i had a better time watching rebel moon the girl o fire than watching the last star wars trilogy
Dec 23 2023,positive,better than most of what disney has put out in the last decade  visually superior to every thing star wars      most of the hate this has gotten so far is unwarranted and childish to say the least
Dec 23 2023,positive,the modern version of 7 samurai     highly recommended
Dec 23 2023,positive,i think it was a very good movie scido and fantasy is my jam i know a lot of comparisons will be made but i didnt feel that way at all i feel some people feel threatened to say films are good because they are in the same genre as other films they love 85 out of 10
Dec 23 2023,positive,action packed the main character is a badass if you cant get enough scifi you have to see this
Dec 23 2023,negative,what an awful movie just a morass of scifi bs weve seen for years now weak plot unimaginative action sequences the 90 lbs lead actress is unconvincing as a ferocious fighter every bad character is fat ugly and slovenly and every good character is thin and handsome and everyone is wearing too much makeup
Dec 23 2023,positive,i really enjoyed it like to see the synder cut of it too
Dec 23 2023,positive,its awesome the heck with the naysayers all movies are drawn from something and this is best since star wars
Dec 23 2023,positive,great fun action packed and visually fantasticwatch for yourselfthose not entertained should stick to soap operas critics have shown time and time again that they know very little about what people like in movies people want entertainment and this movie provides just that
Dec 23 2023,positive,brilliant what a film
Dec 23 2023,positive,looks amazing characters are all very interesting and it left me wanting more but satisfied with what i got to watch
Dec 23 2023,positive,its nowhere near the quality of other recent space operas and its cinematography feels dated imagine the 300 with slightly less slomo scenes the characters and storyline arent too terrible but they never really pulled me in its an okay friday night watch but dont expect anything special
Dec 23 2023,positive,the critics dont know what they are talking about lol they hate anything thats good or different they hate everything that we love they dont have one unique bone in their body i love it and cant wait for part 2
Dec 23 2023,negative,too much slow motiondullseemed like a dollar tree version of star warsi was stoked to watch but within 10 minutes i turned it offwent back and tried to get through it a few more times but its just not goodand i love science fiction movies
Dec 23 2023,negative,it couldnt be more boring narrative long tedious and take us nowhere visual effects excessive used ive just lost hours of life
Dec 23 2023,positive,even though the story line blended a bunch of high action stories it kept me engaged and entertained i will definitely watch part 2
Dec 23 2023,negative,the only good thing about this movie was that it convinced me to sign in to rt for the first time and tell others just how bad it was and man was it bad all the money was spent on visual effects and costume which were good but honestly not amazing the story however was really awful instead of creating something original they decided to plagiarize from many scifi and fantasy sources the dialog was also wooden and cheesy most likely due to the weak story at least it was free
Dec 23 2023,positive,story is a little rushed but it didnt feel politically charged i enjoyed the overall story epic picture critics just dont like it because it was purely for entertainment
Dec 23 2023,positive,alot of things to enjoy here sit back with some popcorn and remember what fun watching a spectacle is
Dec 23 2023,positive,this was a good movie for a part 1 will see once part 2 just how good this movie can be
Dec 23 2023,negative,this is a been there done that sci fi movie with same ole story line the plot is just thin and there really isnt anything of interest that occurs over the entire story arc its a nicely shot movie with decent cast just lacked any character development and seems like it was written by a teenager
Dec 23 2023,negative,please make it illegal for these writers to write another script
Dec 23 2023,positive,i dont see how it is possible that it only got 22 i totally disagree and thought it was well done  really enjoyed it
Dec 23 2023,positive,too much slow mo other than that an ok movie just too much slow motion in the action scenes
Dec 23 2023,positive,movie has a pretty decent story and good visual effects great popcorn movie to sit and watch with the family critic reviews really dont mean anything anymore so dont let their reviews deter you from a great popcorn flick
Dec 23 2023,positive,the dialogue and acting can be a bit corny and forced at times but its supposed to be like star wars so it fits theres no real story arc it seems to just be setting up the characters and world its not really a 5 star movie but it was good enough that i want to see the sequels all of zack snyders trilogy plans get shot down before they can take off itd be nice to see one get off the ground also as a star wars nerd its nice to see a star wars thats not a disney movie to sum up its not spectacular but i would like to see more
Dec 23 2023,positive,saw it 3 times in a row already its a gorgeous looking film loving this fresh approach to the scifi genre i cannot wait for the 2nd part of the rebel moon saga and curious to see the extended cut of both films if there is to be one  if youre a fan of avatar blade runner dune firefly star wars mad max or even the matrix you will enjoy rebel moon highly recommend
Dec 23 2023,positive,the movie has great cinematography and the story is better than what some of the critics state  have a sneaking suspension the poor ratings is a combined effort by the mouse housekk to bring down any star wars competition  i give this movie 5 stars
Dec 23 2023,positive,its a visual and very good history
Dec 23 2023,negative,i feel like this movie just takes bits and pieces out of movies ive already seen before like harry potter with the hippogriff and the light saber swords really got me very unoriginal
Dec 23 2023,negative,nothing original in this movie and a lack luster sound track
Dec 23 2023,positive,the story needs more time and character needs more development which im sure we will get in directors cut and even still its better than star wars
Dec 23 2023,positive,great story telling and action very impressive and recomendable
Dec 23 2023,positive,i enjoyed it visually a beautiful movie the story was too light with so many characters i have to believe the directors cut will flesh that out few characters definitely deserved it hard to judge when its incomplete so well see
Dec 23 2023,negative,ouf arghhhwhat a terrible patchwork of so many good movies i think there is strictly nothing original in this 2 hour mishap
Dec 23 2023,positive,this movie packs stunning visuals and incredible fights i think people expect a space drama with deep characters but it is more of an epic adventure the best way to describe it is to take 300 and combine it with dune add just the right amount of head nods to star wars and gladiator and you have this film it leaves me excited about the future of this franchise good stuff good stuff indeed
Dec 23 2023,positive,worth a watch not the worst not the best visuals are gorgeous dialogue and story are ok character personal interaction was sparse
Dec 22 2023,negative,the movie is way to long for the amount of information presented and the story told it is very disjointed and honestly boring to watch none of the characters are interesting enough to care about or want to know more about and are honestly very generic
Dec 22 2023,positive,rebel moon part one    a visually stunning movie whose biggest détraction is probably an overuse of slow time i find it to be an enjoyable popcorn flick with a story that combines science fiction and fantasy like a pulp novel combined with a tabletop rpg campaign
Dec 22 2023,negative,movie was so trash boring wooden protagonist good guys are idiots i would rather seen movie about the king and queen that got slayed by the assassin
Dec 22 2023,neutral,i got bored of it halfway through it feels like its stealing lots of aspects from different movies yet captures none of the soul of it it feels like its going through the motions but theres nothing behind it
Dec 22 2023,negative,yeah this just wasnt any good
Dec 22 2023,positive,i thought it was brilliant fresh and something different theres so many sheep saying its bad just because they hear others say its bad without even taking it in properly i cannot wait for the next films comics games and story to unfold
Dec 22 2023,positive,another amazing film leave this man alone and let him cook
Dec 22 2023,positive,its a great fun movie to watch stunning visuals fight choreography is also good the story is just okay this is a sci fi roman empire style film at its core
Dec 22 2023,positive,i like the movie its epic and hugely exciting  dont let the reviews from the so called pros influence you
Dec 22 2023,positive,i really liked it but it did feel rushed at moments and it needed more time with the characters because its the first movie so i expected to know more about all the characters properly
Dec 22 2023,negative,this movie was pretty bad the writing was bad the editing was bad the movie felt like they just threw a bunch of scenes together in the hopes that the audience would just follow along like oh sure   its a shame because i really liked the idea of it people can compare it to whatever franchise they want to as it pulled from many but this was just a bad film i was rolling my eyes at dialogue confused about characters motivations and got bored with the ridiculous amount of lets just make this scene look cool rather than putting any creative work into it   wont watch again and wont recommend anyone else to do so
Dec 22 2023,positive,rebel moon part 1 a child of fire is a combination of scifi and fantasy with a breathtaking musical score filled with hope power  creativity at its core the mission of the rebel force is laid out at the beginning  each character is unique and engaging with their own capabilities and motivations meshing together as one as they collide in an epic battle lifestyle there are also plenty of twists  turns throughout the movie to keep one at the edge of their seats the full movie experience is in two parts the second movie to come out april 19th 2024 this part one is an excellent introduction to a new scifi fantasy adventure
Dec 22 2023,positive,felt like a live action finalfantasy liked it a lot
Dec 22 2023,negative,this is so bad that theories of ai writing exist  the language is pompous and noncommunicative  large exposition dumps are interrupted by comicbook speech bubbles that propel the plot from action scene to action scene which alone is a break from utter boredom  the actors are top notch the cgi is good for a streaming movie the story has been lifted from the seven samurai which was reworked as the magnificent seven but to no avail  both those films created tension and an interest in the ronin or gunfighters  not so here where their cardboard nature is as real as the blue screen the actors stand in front of  it completely lacks substance
Dec 22 2023,positive,great world and visuals
Dec 22 2023,positive,rebel moon is very entertaining visually stunning and the action is great
Dec 22 2023,negative,the dialogue is just awful and can we please have a limit on how many times you can use the anamorphic lens flare
Dec 22 2023,positive,wonderful exciting movie much better than star wars loved it fantastic cast
Dec 22 2023,positive,something i  mix of everything
Dec 22 2023,positive,i thought it was an excellent start to this new universe looking forward to part 2
Dec 22 2023,positive,there is nothing original in this movie but dont be put off by the so called professional critics generally the acting is fine the visual effects are fine the movie being over 2 hours runs at pace so you are not sitting there bored its a good way to waste a couple of hours in a film where no thinking is required
Dec 22 2023,positive,good effects good story line dont know why so much hate
Dec 22 2023,positive,visually very impressive give it chance to develop and be open to where its going and youll enjoy it dont fall into the trap of comparing it to others if this was the first time you had watched this genre youd be impressed i cant wait to see part 2
Dec 22 2023,positive,nice space ronin  all lines were not delivered the best but the world building and the action was all there  vfx were alright as well  just an enjoyable action flick
Dec 22 2023,positive,rebel moon   part one  a child of fire   the best movie i watched this year
Dec 22 2023,positive,epic   steals from other classics  who doesnt want to see a mash up of the greats its beautiful
Dec 22 2023,negative,i had high hopes for this movie but the very opening ruined it for me hobbits in space cliche
Dec 22 2023,positive,visually stunning highly imaginative incredible action scenes and yes on overstuffed story that will hopefully come together once part two is released longer runtime and r rating wouldve helped this get to a 5 for me i can assure you like almost all of zacks movies the rt rating is not reflective of his movie  definitely check this movie out if you want to be entertained i liked it better than star wars ep7 8 and 9  by a wide margin
Dec 22 2023,positive,i thought the film was very good i liked the story and i cant wait for part 2 its a shame its going to take a while to come out
Dec 22 2023,negative,shallow plot that failed to get me hooked
Dec 22 2023,positive,i really enjoyed this film it has a good story i can see the star wars in the plot i loved the fx and the acting was top notch great movie almost feels like warhammer 40k
Dec 22 2023,positive,excellent costume designs with loads of small details and the gearclothes all have amazing and realistic weathering to them the world building is slow but giving and critics should just shut the frell up never have they been right the last decade or two listen to the audience instead     amazing film characters and characterbuilding and a solid story you feel compelled to follow would class the movie as a solid future scifi classic  as a propmaker myself i am blown away by the sheer details that they have worked on that you quite never notice id like to put this movie up with space operas like star wars farscape firefly and star gate great drama amazing action and great cgi in the few cases its used yes all spaceship and space is cgi but they have also used a lot of real propsplaces which gives it a lovely gritty and realistic look and feel    definitely will watch again
Dec 22 2023,neutral,same old shtt was very excited for this release movies are getting more disappointing the ever
Dec 22 2023,negative,ok too much slowmo
Dec 22 2023,positive,i really liked rebel moon okay you can argue that everything has already been done in other scifi movies but snyders esthetics make it feel fresh the characters are introduced and you get the feeling that this movie is just a prelude to bigger stories to come i for myself im looking forward to part 2 and hopefully a lot more parts
Dec 22 2023,negative,so disappointing why did they not get a decent screenwriter the story is disjointed and totally devoid of any connection with characters  his worst film yet and im a fan
Dec 22 2023,negative,it had great potential but introduce 3 characters that did nothing in part one i speak of general titus tarak nemesis and they just got along for the ride because of yeah we go against the motherland and believe some random people they never saw first i thought they where friends with kai which is the best character because hes reasoning makes sense but there not so it makes even less sense why tarak and nemesis would help them for only so they could fight against the motherland its such a whimsy reason they should have shown less characters and give them more story and reasoning they should have cut the backstory stuff from the main character shorter so they could actually build the other characters a bit more i really tried to like it i liked the twist with kai but all in all they just wanted to much in part one they just could have let kora and the farmer go together searching they finding kai and he knows kora is worth much money so he betrays her immediately then does two can find away to run away maybe the young soldier was with them and could have been killed in the escape so they lose someone that helped them from the beginning or even the roboter he could have changed and helped them because at the start it looked like they will play a bigger role in the first part if not why even introduce them in the first plays if they then will be forgotten for the whole movie and may find general titus the deserter and he tells them about the other two surviving special soldiers from hes special squad named taric and nemesis so titus would be the reason why the other to would want to help them and then they will find the rebels in the second part maybe just dont rush it
Dec 22 2023,positive,what a intriguing new universe to explore character builds are fresh and exciting so much to look forward too durring the second viewing something that the directors great at is the little details in not just the props and sets but the actors as well rebel moon has got the whole package its hard to find characters worth unpacking but the contrasting characters in rebel moon are as pleasing as the high contrasting cinematography dont listen to the critics on this one they are asleep
Dec 22 2023,negative,story 05  acting 05  special effects 25  overall    this is gobots trying to be starwars   the story is a straightforward copy of battle for the planets without the charm so derivative to a level i have never witnessed  the acting is as good as the willow tv show   the special effects were passable   i applaud the attempt to make a new scifi universe but this an example of why directors should not try to write movies or shows   it also proves that spending the most money doesnt guarantee good quality  i personally just didnt enjoy this i hope you do and if you do thats great   for the record 300 is one of my favourite films because it was basically a direct translation of the amazing work of frank millar  i enjoyed the jlsc  but this was just a big miss for me
Dec 22 2023,positive,5960its chopped and unfinished it would of made a good star wars movie but its good to have an alternative its not perfect it has its editing flaws and comes off with a rogue onerise of skywalkerdune vibe it borrows from some movies but does good with those elements if there is a extended version id like to see it part 2 is coming soon
Dec 22 2023,positive,the movie is amazing and for all the people saying its how it copies form other movies well anyone that heard the interviews knew that he made it to be a star wars film but it was too mature so he went his own way with it but he made it to be heavily inspired by star wars because he is give star wars nerd  every movie i see now borrow heavily from another so im not understanding why everyone is botheredwait thats wrong i do know why rotten tomatoes a company bought and paid for by disney and a site that has been proven over and over again to be completely fake and fraudulent would have a problem and i know why the critics who on here who are bought and paid for by disney  and amazon would have a problem with it sand if you have half a brain and keep up with whats going on around you then you will understand as well this is movies is ver good
Dec 22 2023,negative,a sorry ass excuse of a star wars ripoff
Dec 22 2023,positive,not sure why all the hate here definitely worth a watch
Dec 22 2023,negative,i was so excited to see what the end of all star wars was going to beseeing that star wars is my all time favorite franchises that being said i can understand why george lucas rejected this i dont know what was worse the gratuitous hero shots all over the movie felt like zach stroking his own ego at every corner or the horrible dialog and acting i cant blame the actors for that i blame the director for giving them the wrong direction the music was unnecessarily epic on every kinda hero shot moment it was queue the hero musicshes going to sneeze so star wars franchise killer i think notlol btw this was my very first ever movie review how did i do p
Dec 22 2023,negative,this was hands down one of the worst movies ive ever seen not only was it derivative but it was borderline plagiarism of some of the most beloved scifi classics as well as some other beloved media such as the magnificent seven the movie boasts good visuals and thats where the positives end it is pretentious poorly written and even worse acted even it being in the star wars universe as it was originally intended would not have saved this slop from being a blatant creatively bankrupt laughingstock of the scifi fantasy space opera genre please for the love of god if this movie interests you go watch dune part 1 instead as it boasts similar visuals without the brain rot attached
Dec 22 2023,positive,first off im going to start by saying when professional critics rate a movie bad majority of the time i can almost guarantee i will like it   critics seem to be paid for fake reviews   i myself enjoyed this movie as i do for the majority of zacks content this kept me intrigued and invested from start to finish beautiful visuals and good character development     but most of all watch and make up your own mind
Dec 22 2023,negative,a collection of pretty schlock the film lacks any depth of character or the slightest homage to the heros quest there are better written video game stories otherwise i would say it might work as video game the two most sympathetic and interesting characters were left in the first act a water girl and a droid  both would have made better protagonists than the shallow archetypes in the story it could have been better with even an amateur writer at the helm story first not spectacle disappointing
Dec 22 2023,negative,rips everything from 40k to obviously star wars  no original ideas anywhere to be seen also boring complete waste of a giant budget
Dec 22 2023,positive,i thought it was a very good scifi action movie with a the magnificent seven vibe  i really want to see the full edit now
Dec 22 2023,negative,irrelevant characters forming a team to fight for an irrelevant cause  the story feels like a boring side quest in any rpg out there help these farmers to defend themselves against the evil  only the protagonist gets a little backstory everyone else just pops up on the screen and one cut later they are suddenly part of the squad    dialogues are bad over usage of slow mo most charakters feel fake    i dont even want to watch the 2nd part because its so boring
Dec 22 2023,positive,great film and awesome introduction to this exciting new world  some back stories would benefit from being fleshed out and likely will be in the directors cut  bring on part 2
Dec 22 2023,positive,serviceable seven samurai in space movie could be the foundation of a cinematic universe  it is pretty transparent sam is the princess
Dec 22 2023,positive,great story amazing cast and awesome cinematography
Dec 22 2023,positive,decent film  rushed middle part which im assuming will be sorted when the extended r version comes out cgi looks better than anything by marvel and dc in past few years and done in a tighter budget  zs really knows how to get the most bang for his money great movie for the dark winter nights  kids loved it  typical rotten tomatoes score for a zs movie  corrupt scoring system  good to see nothing has changed  rtoms are on their way out and its about time
Dec 22 2023,negative,from as far back to seven samurai to a bugs life its recycled story lines with shiny cgi and action choreography heres a recap im just a farmer just kidding we are gonna take on the empire you down ah you son of a b im in
Dec 22 2023,negative,very bland boring predictive extremly stupid plot too many slow motion scenes good music and scenery
Dec 22 2023,positive,amazing  its fresh not trying what is currently going on with movies of this century but also futuristic
Dec 22 2023,positive,i was hooked from the first second from narration cinematography story and it keeps you glued to the screen throughout the end gears you up and gets you anxious to start the sequel right away a great sci fi film
Dec 22 2023,negative,almost insultingly predictable and completely uninventive honestly i only made it half way through and watched the rest the following dayreluctantly
Dec 22 2023,negative,cheap star wars good only to pass a lonley night
Dec 22 2023,negative,well if you are looking for a story you are in for one big disappointmentdreadful just dreadful plotvisually somewhat acceptable but again pg version just dont cut it that barn at the beginning should be dripping in blood for example
Dec 22 2023,negative,i wanted to love this but it was just boring the story and the acting didnt pull me in and the world didnt feel big enough there was too much crammed into the run time dissapointed
Dec 22 2023,positive,it was a pretty good movie story could have been a little better but it  had good action scenes and visuals
Dec 22 2023,negative,not great leftover orc costumes plot holes bad acting
Dec 22 2023,negative,bland and foreseeable mixture of better movies  great cgi and visuals in general but no real storytelling except for exposition which feels out of place and generic at the same time
Dec 22 2023,positive,visually stunning even though theres a lot of action i think they could have trimmed a few minutes here and there  still a good story with excellent special effects
Dec 22 2023,positive,despite initially beginning the movie in a state of halfsleep i found myself instantly drawn into its world within the first five minutes the film presents certain elements that echo familiar themes from other scifi classics a nod perhaps to its unique developmental history this aspect far from being a drawback adds to its charm the journey was so immersive that i found myself feeling a tinge of sadness as it concluded anticipation is already building for the next instalment in this captivating series
Dec 22 2023,positive,a stunning scifi fest inspired by all the best with interesting characters massive world building and a streamlined plot
Dec 22 2023,negative,this is what hollywood thinks we want jesus christ its worst than the dune remake
Dec 22 2023,negative,its all so flat and one note despite a score and visuals that insist otherwise go watch firefly instead ps and the casting  charlie hunnam for fucks sake
Dec 22 2023,positive,love the characters and amazing cgi work rebel moon is epic cant wait for the next movie
Dec 22 2023,positive,love it great story telling great cgi
Dec 22 2023,positive,great movie excellent castingcant wait for the rest of the movies to come out
Dec 22 2023,negative,derivative cruel bad acting tired storylines gratuitous had to turn it off  special effects do not a motion picture make no zack just no
Dec 22 2023,positive,this movie is fantastic  cant wait until part 2  visually stunning excellent sound editing and decent storyline  great cast as well
Dec 22 2023,positive,this was the best movie ive seen in a while
Dec 22 2023,negative,so bad and so orange a space movie where you go from mining town to farming town to cargo town its ugly and mainly out of focus and lense flair
Dec 22 2023,negative,possibly the worst movie iv ever endured dont know what was worst the writing the constant slow motion scenes or the acting all are absolutely shocking we spent most of the movie laughing at how bad it was
Dec 22 2023,positive,rebel moon part 1 is damned amazing akira kurosawa would be proud hint so first off i am old enough to have seen the first star wars commercial trailer on a 1977 panasonic tv and then see the movie 12 times in a row in waikiki in 1977 since then i spent 30 years in the marines fighting 2 actual wars been to every con and still ticking the negative reviewers can go swallow a light saber blind   the story line in rebel moon and the characters are all familiar going back to decades of other parables but the way rm weaves the narratives given the time and pacing available is newand freshly unfamiliar as the epic scenery and graphical style it frickin drips with molten awesomeness the slow mo shoot outs are like dead eye from red dead but better the blasters and sabers are reinvented the protagonist kora   hello tron and last avatar is a believable sleeper bad ass chic ala vazquez in aliens gen titus in a gladiator stadium wanting to die with honor  hell yes ptsd for a flag officer maximus salutes you siragain i could go on but why just watched with my 3 kids and hell gonna watch again tonight with sub woofers on kill thank you zach snyder semper fi mf
Dec 22 2023,negative,soooo lets start one they arent space nazis they are just nazis in space the cgi starts out great first world looks awesome but in my opinion the visuals fade very quickly after leaving the ssssssssssssssslllllllooooooooooo mmmmmmmooooooooo is everywhere they are farming in slow mo slow mo doesnt make things more important or better now my second huge gripe is the constant fucking exposition dumps jesus they are nearly constant 12 in every arc you can show or tell zs does both bold move but you cant do it 9 times now great plot idea to build a team but for me the team is too big smaller team would help us care more about the charters so when things happen we can really feel the outcomes also lets talk about the leading lady looks great but i have trouble really connecting to her she feels very forced and i think maybe the directors cut can bridge this gap but why release it the visuals are great i suggest watching it in theaters or make it as cinematic as possible think felt more like a what you missed catch up to a tv series very episodic continuity was an issue for me which brings me to pacing which wasnt very good maybe the directors cut can save it and really make it resonate with me for now i want to give it a 5710 for the fact its a new ip for zs i will say a 6210
Dec 22 2023,negative,i stopped the streaming at one third of the movie i simply could not take more bad dialogues obsessive compulsive slow motion uneven digital effects an unimaginative and derivative plot this movie is just unwatchable
Dec 22 2023,positive,great movie still world building and has few unexplained stuffbut they building something good here really looking forward to directors cut and part 2 
Dec 22 2023,positive,the movie is hugely entertaining the story does more than enough to hold you it is visually stunning my only hope is that the second installment lives up to the first one it is really amazing to see a new ip that can weave a great storie with amazing effects well done zach
Dec 22 2023,negative,rebel moon is so desperate to be epic that it constantly trips itself up by not giving you a reason to care monologues with drama club level dialogue are thrown around without giving you a single reason to care about the characters its a masterclass in the worst kind of story telling which is a thing happens then another thing happens then another thing happens and all the while i just dont care about any of it because i havent been given a reason to some of the actions scenes are decent but slowmo is overused cgi is decent but uninspired if you have anything else to watch give it a go before you watch this absolute clunker
Dec 22 2023,positive,great dont believe the critics  cant wait for the second film
Dec 22 2023,negative,not good story is lacking actors are dull way too many characters
Dec 22 2023,positive,i loved this movie it has everything and more great characters storyline and scenery was incredible
Dec 22 2023,positive,i can truly say that there is so much potential with this film it was entertaining to watch aside from a few moments where you could tell some scenes were cut i do wish we already had the extended version available however overall its a good start to a franchise
Dec 22 2023,negative,crazy script bad picture also
Dec 22 2023,positive,very fun movie unfortunately it has to do a bit of world building to differ from star wars other than that its a nice set up for further adventures
Dec 22 2023,positive,wasnt sure what to make of this film at the start but after it finished i was looking forward to part 2   reminds me of dune star wars and im looking forward to character development and the rise of the droids
Dec 22 2023,negative,a pretentious piece of garbagetwo hours of boredom in slow motion the dialogue and the plot diverge right at the beginning of the movie and they do not converge again until the credits the only thing that is marginally good is the photography at times    will i watch the second part of course but only to write an even more colorful review
Dec 22 2023,positive,i was looking forward to seeing this movie and the biggest disappointment is that i have to wait 3 months to see the end  im surprised at the critics reviews but i believe its because they have to see wait 3 months to see the ending as well  such a long wait is silly in my opinion and makes me uninterested in seeing how it ends
Dec 22 2023,positive,i really enjoyed this i was grabbed straight away by the fantasy elements thrown into a sci fi world as a fan of zack snyders normally and a fan of sci fi and fantasy it just came together with a fantastic combination of things i enjoy     i understand some of the these characters needed more development criticism a lot went on and some of them in particular their motivations were unclear things that im sure the longer cut later will clear up but issues none the less it didnt hinder my enjoyment just some id have liked to see more of     the world building was really great and seeing this play out as the first half of a larger story giving a little context and purposefully leaving out some elements that are due to play forward next film was interesting    while it could have served from developing some of the characters stronger i loved the world we saw and am so excited to see it all expand
Dec 22 2023,positive,this movie is an unapologetic love letter to every sci fi movie book and idea that came before it  it is spectacularly beautiful incredibly fun and absolutely worth checking out  as a reference point i thought sucker punch was unwatchable it was so bad but i loved watchmen even though they changed the ending and 300   i believe as i am 54 years old the only star wars movies were episodes iv and v and rogue one and the only worthwhile series has been andor  if youre like minded youll love rebel moon  i dont get all the negativity  just enjoy it
Dec 22 2023,negative,one of the worst movies ever made youd literally have breandead to enjoy it
Dec 22 2023,positive,yet another example of how critics just simply dont matter they are obsolete the movie was a joy from start to finish the heavy influence from things like warhammer 40000 only add to this love letter to science fiction this is the last jedi we should have had
Dec 22 2023,positive,entertaining and great visuals simple ploti enjoyed it
Dec 22 2023,positive,great film really enjoyed it and cant wait for part 2 film critics know nothing
Dec 22 2023,positive,wow zack is nailing it you get what expected and alot more aliens beautiful violence infinite universe with great possibilities 
Dec 22 2023,positive,for someone as myself who is very picky of what i like i have to say rebel moon was very good to me i really really liked it   yes the visuals were great but the storyline i see where its beginning and where it is going just a beginning of it all  the movie is good yall and worth the watch and i believe that when the ratedr come outwhenever the heck that would be it will be even much better
Dec 22 2023,positive,my only criticism is that you can tell a lot was held back to make the pg13 shouldve just gone full on with the r rating
Dec 22 2023,positive,4 to combat the unfair critics rating it is good well made and better than expected due to critics
Dec 22 2023,positive,an excellent start to a franchise that has a ton of potential
Dec 22 2023,negative,i have never left a review on a movie but this  smdh battlefield earth vibes  and i wont even address the audio level issues     the music is loud and effects are loud dialogue is low because its pretty pointless in listening to the acting or story     i had high hopes and they were shattered in the first 15 min it sucks i watched the whole thing thinking it would get better 
Dec 22 2023,negative,awful blatant ripoff of so many better movies
Dec 22 2023,negative,put a chick in it make it lame   same old same old
Dec 22 2023,negative,an incoherent mess of a movie with horrible dialogue and character development
Dec 22 2023,positive,the 1st 20 or so minutes i was picking apart all the self inflicted wounds and paint by numbers bs but then my brain shut off and i started having fun its very rogue one riddick oceans 11 and dd honorthieves in a blender  if your older its new hope excalibur krull  sword and the sorcerer and gloria in a blender or something like that you get the point
Dec 22 2023,positive,the movie is incredible so glad it didnt get picked up by disney critics were bagging on it before anyone got to see it the fact that the audience score is so much higher now that its been released for wider viewing proves that critics should be ignored great visuals strong characters underdog story derivative yes but so is everything glad to have some world building without it being tied to another existing franchise we need more of this rather than perpetual spinoffs to play on nostalgia
Dec 22 2023,positive,stunning visual and great action scenes
Dec 22 2023,negative,childish characterisation derivative plot and self indulgent action and imagery
Dec 22 2023,negative,sucker punch all over again weird juvenile weightless unengaging grotesque aesthetics and braindead world building somewhere between a dull trip to grandmas house and a forced stay at a juggalo convention
Dec 22 2023,negative,arguably the worst movie of recent years
Dec 22 2023,negative,boring rehashed tropes with no consideration for story
Dec 22 2023,negative,it is god awful i mean really bad incomprehensibly horrid i cant find the correct words to describe the depth of putrid hideousness that fouls the air in which we breathe      what ive just watched is one of the most insanely idiotic things i have ever seen at no point in its rambling incoherent story was it even close to anything that could be considered a rational story line everyone who watched it is now dumber for having viewed it i award you no points and may god have mercy on your soul
Dec 22 2023,negative,no wonder lucas didnt want to do this awful star wars retread
Dec 22 2023,positive,a movie for fiction lovers  those who dont like fiction in its purest essence will say that they didnt like it that they thought it was soso among other lame reasons if youre reading this dont draw conclusions from these poor people the movie is excellent in every respect with excellent special effects an interesting story about an overwhelming and savage force over people incapable of defending themselves and which will have much more to come in part 2 excellent setting among others for lovers of star wars star trek lord of the rings and fans of themes involving authoritarianism youll give this movie a 10 for those who love fiction youll give it something close to that the movie is excellent and i recommend you draw your own conclusions from it             um filme para amantes de ficção  aqueles que não curtem ficção na sua mais pura essência irá dizer que não gostou que achou tal coisa entre outros motivos fuleiras caso você esteja lendo não tire conclusões com estas pessoas pobres o filme é excelente em todos aspectos excelente efeitos especiais história interessante acerca de uma força esmagadora e selvagem sobre pessoas incapazes de se defender e que ainda terá muito mais na parte 2 excelente ambientação entre outros para os amantes de star wars star trek senhor dos anéis e fãs das temáticas que envolvem autoritarismo esse filme você irá dar nota 10 para os que amam ficção darão algo perto disso o filme é excelente e recomendo tirar suas próprias conclusões do filme
Dec 22 2023,negative,while ill always be thankful for watchmen this just came off as pretentious i dont think that there was a single scene where i didnt say oh ive seen that before but the original film did it better whether it was star wars riddick seven samurai magnificent seven and even battle beyond the stars  nothing to see here  move along move along
Dec 22 2023,negative,the movie is not convincing because it has issues with screenwriting and acting regarding screenwriting the movie is flat without suspense it is boring and the actors do not have charisma it is impossible to believe the characters they are bad actors if we talk about clothing characters they are cheap without creativity to use good visual effects sometimes is not enough this bad film looks like solo and rouge one the producer should ask why the star wars series are better
Dec 22 2023,positive,excellent much better than recent star wars installments
Dec 22 2023,positive,good watch fantastic effects only big minis from me is the story which starts awesome and after am hour going down to themoment when i started to wonder why the heck was thise 2hrs of movie i watched still pretty good
Dec 22 2023,positive,enjoyed it more than i expected given the beating it took from the critics   give it a try pretty good movie
Dec 22 2023,positive,its not original its not star wars or any in its genre who really cares why do critics always feel the need to compare in a predicament where its reviewed solely on its own existence its entertaining none of these critics have a creative bone in their body other than pull others hard work to pieces enjoyable movie for me no comparisons
Dec 22 2023,positive,i really enjoyed rebel moon part one its visually stunning the effects are great and the fighting just as i like it as many said its a variation of seven samurai story magnificent seven the dirty dozen in space and as a lifelong science fiction fan this was right in my alley i know it started as a star wars spinoff idea but i felt it was more farscape and firefly on steroids just something i needed cant wait for part two
Dec 22 2023,positive,dont go by the critics this is a entertaining movie and worth viewing
Dec 22 2023,positive,it creates endless possibilities for upcoming movies
Dec 22 2023,positive,rebel moon firefly and magnificent 7 mashup was entertaining  but i think it was missing a nathan fillion 
Dec 22 2023,positive,it was a mash of all space opera movies  plus add in some harry porter tomb raider and 300
Dec 22 2023,positive,this visually stunning scifi epic is amazing better than most of what hollywoods 200 mil  movies had offered us lately its so impressive how wrong the critics were a movie for you and your girlpartner will enjoy on a friday night with food it automatically hooks you in to the story the bad guys were great antagonist the main character kora was bad ass in such a believable way no mary sue who isnt afraid of being sexy and powerful but this movie will leave you wanting more your gonna want more character backgrounds more worlds to visit  more aliens to see more fights and when the 3hr directors cut comes out we will have more i cannot withhold my anticipation for part 2 in april a great watch
Dec 22 2023,positive,if youre a fan of zack movies youre be in for a treat
Dec 22 2023,negative,boring with no storyline and no strong characters mainstream entertainment is fading off and if were lucky well have just one awesome scifi movie once a year rip
Dec 22 2023,positive,an amazing creation of different realms all meshing into a single movie  wow if youre a sucker for scifi action packed films  prepare to be sucked into this one  on the edge of your seat for the next to release will be great to see more character building but overall was quite the experience well done
Dec 22 2023,positive,very good movienot the best of the world but a very good onei liked the reference even if sometime it feel like a geek fever  dream it has good action and a little twist in the end  i also think the critic is  a bit harshits no dune but its not battefield earth   see you for the 2nd part
Dec 22 2023,positive,no way this should be rated so negative one of the best movies ive seen in awhile
Dec 22 2023,negative,not memorable a bit boring got to the end just
Dec 22 2023,positive,loved it it was an awesome ride i cant wait for pt2 dont listen to the critics  the movie is a breath of fresh air
Dec 22 2023,positive,amazing movie story was also amazing
Dec 22 2023,positive,nice waiting for part two
Dec 22 2023,negative,i really dont understand how this goes through an multiple takes editing review process and no goes hey this battle destroyer that is in combat flies through space dealing with micro meteors has glass that a spear can get through like what     or that hey the kings is dead but later show they can reincarnate with memories the trop of people dyeing and then coming back two seconds later it getting really old    they make a big deal about getting general titus and how scary it will be but was 30 seconds of dialog and then like ok i will come with you they focus more on that gryphon rifder then the general who they were foreshadowing would be a hard sell if you going to have your characters talk about how scary he is maybe he should be the main focus of the side characters you are picking up    story dull zack synder 300 action style getting old i really think he needs better writers around him and editors that can rain him in overall this was a dud for me i donte ven care about part 2
Dec 22 2023,negative,if you are doing something else this will cover 2 hours and 15 minutes as a movie to sit and watch dont it was like a fever dream of disparate tropes it was as though the writers peeled apart star wars foundation series chronicles of riddick anime and half a dozen other scififantasy titles and put it in front of great imagery i felt nothing for the characters throughout despite liking some of the actors based on other work and the story lacked depth the flashbacks helped with the story building but they were inserted poorly overall this could have been better but it would have started with the writing
Dec 22 2023,positive,for what is was it was really good you can see where the context of scenes are left out because it is the pg13 version extremely anticipating rrated 3 hour movie i can tell already from this viewing its going to be insane i got what i needed out of it but didnt get what i wanted admiral noble is brutal and kai was fantastic those two were my favs kora and jimmy where solid i really wanted more from nemesis but i should get that from rrated version all  all solid movie dont believe these haters family had a really fun time watching
Dec 22 2023,positive,loved the movie just missing character development to be perfecto
Dec 22 2023,positive,its like star wars from the dollar store or you could say even temu but its fun and great to see if you like overcomplicated storytelling of scifi movies 
Dec 22 2023,negative,a terrible and clumsy mess that took effort to keep watching almost every aspect of the film after the first 15 minutes was rough
Dec 22 2023,negative,300 meets rogue one without the charm or passion    i made it to act 2 couldnt get past that    feels clunky lazy and uninspired    act i had incredible potential then completely fell flat    also female protagonist had no weakness  stopped caring after awhile    visually cool    i wanted to love it
Dec 22 2023,positive,the movie is not as bad as i thought it would be i was able to just turn my brain off and enjoy the action knowing there is a part 2 and directors cut i guess i cant be too critical of this part 1 because its clear the story is not complete but i think they could have just cut it in to 30 to 40 minute episodes and made it a mini series
Dec 22 2023,positive,for me movie was awesome   story was good explained all very well every one had their time im story  action scena are very good cant w8 for second part it was na intruduction into universe of rebel moon
Dec 22 2023,negative,from the press i had seen i was really excited to watch this  a dark star wars  andor extra was the impression i had   it was awful  i was embarrassed i had recommended it to my family  the first left after about 20 minutes   its drivel  magnificent 7 with absolutely no character establishment  obscene over use over slow mo for fight scenes everything was pedestrian and predictable  by the end we were as a family predicting every next move of the  and i use the term lightly  plot   nearly everything was stolen from other films  and then done badly  magnificent 7 lord of the rings  star wars  terminator chappy  the list goes on and on   even a wish arthur shelby to boot    black adam had a better written and more believable script and with deeper characters too     i suspect part 2 is already past the point of no return but there is absolutely no chance there is going to be a part 3   directors cut  yeah he should be  from all future productions 
Dec 22 2023,positive,this movie is good dont believe the critics watch it and decide for yourself
Dec 22 2023,positive,reminded me of all 80s anime and b movie scifi which i love
Dec 22 2023,positive,oh rebel moon i dont know mixed feelings great film but the story was meh it needed more and zack please stop over using the blurring effect otherwise cant wait for part 2
Dec 22 2023,positive,critics dont even know what theyre looking for in a actionscifi the movie was fun and original 
Dec 22 2023,positive,fantastic music magnificent visuals great action empire is a real menace cannot wait for the second part
Dec 22 2023,negative,i went into this hopeful for an epic scifi experience the character development was shallow and was overridden by the action sequences it lacked depth for a world built with huge potential i cant even say that archetypes were used successfully
Dec 22 2023,negative,can confirm the rebel moon is made of cheese  i wanted to like it just like the film wanted to have gravitas we both failed  it doesnt borrow other film tropes it press gangs all of them unwillingly into service  the end result is a mishmash of underwhelming moments
Dec 22 2023,negative,omg what a brillent massive film by zachary zyndra hurry up 4part w2in april carnt wail to long lol carnt wait to see part 2 2hr film was amazing film enjoy it
Dec 22 2023,positive,a couple of cheesy scenes but there is nonstop action plenty to draw you in emotionally and oh such much badassness leaves you wanting to know the tragic yet beautiful backstory of every character
Dec 22 2023,negative,i had high hopes but they fell flat with this movie visually stunning at times but thats about it
Dec 22 2023,positive,fun movie with great characters and set in an interesting universe  dont understand the negative reviews
Dec 22 2023,negative,one of the most boring and useless movie ever made
Dec 22 2023,negative,half the movie was in slowmotion lots of big explosions and cool characters good way to waste a couple of hours
Dec 22 2023,positive,awsome film i absolutely love it  cant wait for part 2
Dec 22 2023,positive,does it have the best writing no is it watchable and entertaining yes
Dec 22 2023,positive,firstly i thought the film had great effects a great cast something i hadnt seen in this type of film in a long time fiction film and i would like to say that the film managed to express itself successfully
Dec 22 2023,negative,i admittedly only got through 34 of the movie an fell asleep  i was surprised that the visuals in this werent better considering thats what the director is known for  it is really slow i mean really slow maybe the slow motion made that more apparent  with star wars being iffy with their movies lately i thought there might be a window for this but even at their worst they are much better  it feels like the 1 store knock off  some directors need someone reeling them in a bit this is a prime example
Dec 22 2023,negative,visuals audio actoring are really good plot is one of the worst clusterfucks of bad writting i have ever experienced dont be fooled by okayish intro it only gets worse
Dec 22 2023,positive,due to the audacious marketing that this was the next star wars it was automatically held up on a high pedestal thats something that you need to allow your audience to proclaim not your lackey marketing goblins it took me awhile to separate myself from that and just look at it as it was     it was fine it was certainly visual and it had some genre panache at times it felt like they threw every successful scifi franchise in an ai blender and said cook the characters were interesting enough i just hardly know much about any of them outside of kora there wasnt much character development sure each of this sci fi fellowship can handle their own but thats not who they are to their core when big things start happening in the story i just shrugged they are still strangers to me and the danger is very low stakes all very frustrating as we have the capacity for deep story telling with the glimmer of mythology from the princess issa story thats basically as deep as it gets     the third act definitely felt rushed and very sudden not in a fun aha gotcha way kinda like they were assessing that they needed to end and decided to end by doing so they put in a beat where they killed the weight of some of the important setup by the narrator at the beginning jist cast it aside with no consequences overall making the payoff a bit hollow     heres hoping pt 2 paves the way more thoughtfully     all a shame
Dec 22 2023,negative,it was pitched as a star wars film and you can see that literally taking many things from it with little difference including scenes    the characters are very one dimensional with little reason to like any of them and there are far too many for what is a 2 part film duo i struggle to think part 2 will get you invested in any of them     each character is quickly glossed over and makes it feel like how the star wars sequel trilogy felt in terms of character development non existent any background of the main character of which i do not even know her name is told in the form of her talking over a flashback instead of showing these events really unfold    slow motion is beyond egregious sure it looks pretty but its over used so much it makes the scenes where its used well less impactful because im seeing it constantly    it is just another mediocre film that feels like a really bad star wars rip off sadly    the villain guy is slightly compelling and im more interested in his story tbh    i dont think a part 2 will save the shallowness of this film
Dec 22 2023,negative,i could not get into it visually was stunning but the storyline just lacked holes in the plot and not enough background on the   characters very ḍisapointed
Dec 22 2023,positive,friggin awesome if you like badass fight and action scenes in a much darker more grim star wars world then youll love this movie do not let the rotten tomatoes review stop you from watching this movie baffles me a movie this entertaining can get such a bad review here very cool to see another interpretation of the star wars world not through the eyes of disney
Dec 22 2023,positive,the world building was stellar and so was the visuals as well although some of the acting and writing was subpar most of it worked fluidly i do recommend
Dec 22 2023,positive,its a promising universe we want to see more and continue on this world the film is a classic snider movie with characters that play really well and of course beautiful sniderstyle visuals
Dec 22 2023,negative,awful film slow motion scenes every 30 seconds some shocking acting had to turn it off before charlie hunnam came into the movie because id hate to see such a good actor be apart of that shambles truly awful film and directing story was slow and boring
Dec 22 2023,positive,why such bad reviews this was fun
Dec 22 2023,positive,i enjoyed it it did feel like two films were compressed into one 2 hour film unfortunately looking forward to the second film
Dec 22 2023,positive,really enjoyed it like what they did with the han solo character looking forward to the extended cut as more character development definitely needed
Dec 22 2023,negative,rebel moon part one was a bit of a letdown for me i had heard that this was originally a pitch for a star wars movie but i went in with certain expectations i was imagining a slightly grittier version of star wars and instead it was a mashup of stereotypical scifi tropes and far too much slowmotion action     the theming of the movie was all over the place as well it appeared that they were trying to go with a sort of romaninspired theming for the main antagonists however it was done in a way that felt very much like several other large scifi franchises there were also themes of westerns and samuraininja theming in there as well and they didnt find a way to blend them successfully in my opinion on the same planet there was also a village that was of a northern european style akin to viking culture and they rode their animals a day ride to a town and it was essentially a futuristic mashup of a wild west town no two places seemed to be connected in this universe with everything having such vastly different design languages    aside from the failed theming of the film i had some serious issues with pacing as well when the protagonists were traveling there was no time between their previous encounters and the new they would be on the ground about to leave and then immediately in another area about to meet with the person they were looking for there was no buildup in meeting any of the individuals they were looking for and there was no real reason that they were making any of the stops in the first place it wasnt revealed until nearly the end of the film why they had been picking up particular individuals and the twist in the story was seen for a long time coming again with the timing being so odd nearly all of the action in this is of the slowmotion variety while i dont have anything against that in itself when you watch the same people moving very slowly for about 5 minutes in what could have been a 30second encounter you start to get a bit bored    i also have some issues with the story itself however i wont spoil that here ill just say that the only characters that i was truly invested in either died after being on screen for a few minutes or had a very minor role in the film i wasnt able to find a good connection to any of the main cast as all of their characters were truly unlikable except for the farmer every other main character had some element to them that made them feel as though they could be disposable and that i wouldnt mind if they died in the film    the story of rebel moon was a bit too much thrown in your face the audience wasnt allowed to see the story unfold as there was far too much of the story that was told a common theme in great films is to make the story seen not told rebel moon failed miserably at that     one area that this film shines through is its effects i thought that they looked quite good there is a robot character that shows up quite early in the film and it looks fantastic its not all good though as many of the aliens in the film look like they took a person and altered them slightly none of them apart from one in my opinion look rather good they seem to be just costumed people with rubber faces there were no unique alien ideas again aside from one that used another person to talk for them    overall if you are interested in cheesy scifi and dont mind a halfbaked story then go ahead and watch this if however you dont like the overtroped scifi and slowmotion messes stay away its not for you
Dec 22 2023,positive,generally i was entertained and plan to watch part 2 but there some parts that did not feel right for example some dialogues felt a bit weird also it might would have helped starting this first part with a smaller main cast to flesh out characters a bit more
Dec 22 2023,positive,i wasnt too sure if i wanted to take a chance on this filmluckily i trust myself and decided to judge it by myself the story was not what i expectedit was much better the characters were all fantastic the acting was really well done the message of the story was truly inspiring judge the movie yourself i am sooo looking forward to part 2 and see what happens to these amazing people thank you for entertaining me for the second or this time this entire year
Dec 22 2023,negative,bro just copied star wars and thought we wouldnt notice cancel part 2 pls
Dec 22 2023,negative,a bunch of stock characters gather to defeat bunch of cardboard cuts outs in order to protect a village ive seen this movie before and i liked it better when it was called the seven samurai the magnificent seven or bugs life if there were less slow motion we might be able to squeeze in some character development but i guess we get to wait until the three  hour directors cut is released to get any of that
Dec 22 2023,positive,this movie was fun well paced and much more dynamic than any of the recent marvel  star wars showsmovies
Dec 22 2023,positive,great movie loved the cinematic scenes cgi was awesome apart from some scene where it felt it could be better the character building of main character girl kora is amazing loved it but other characters where short on their build up about the team they all teamed up so quickly i thought it would take a bit more convincing to recruit them and their aims are so bad they are top notch fighters arnt they   overall these are just some things which i dont say are bad but could have been better to have loved this movie hyped to the build up this universe is going to be epic  highly recommended
Dec 22 2023,negative,the most expensive high school production ive ever seen
Dec 22 2023,positive,its an amazing movie a great beginning for this new universe
Dec 22 2023,positive,awesome movie some really great action scenes and you can tell he took inspiration from star wars warhammer 40k and maybe even star trek but i cant wait for part 2
Dec 22 2023,positive,cant wait for part 2
Dec 22 2023,negative,bland pointless benign boring forgettable all words that explain this movie i respect the attempt but it ended with a jumbled mess of one liners and attempts at creating a deeper plot but missing completely nothing about this was unique multiple actors that i really enjoy and i am sad that they werent brought to their full potential with this syfy leftover mess
Dec 22 2023,negative,everything about the movie is paper thin and it is so selfserious that its hard to take seriously with the nonstop slow motion and choral chanting it wants so badly to be epic but doesnt lay the groundwork needed to feel like any of it is deserved
Dec 22 2023,positive,it was what i expected
Dec 22 2023,positive,an actionpacked lorerich scifi universe that seems both believable and real the action scenes are highly detailed and entertaining the lore given and the mystery of the lore untold will leave fan theory crafters and loreobsessed fans with a load of content to unravel if star wars met warhammer 40k it would be rebel moon part one a child of fire
Dec 22 2023,negative,wow this movie is absolute trash i want my time back
Dec 22 2023,positive,slowly building up the lore with as much detail as possible amazing cgi gigantic universe unpredictable and end the part one with a unique dark and insanely epic battle oh man i found some ways of killing very creative thanks zack for this one it is truly unique i keep screaming alone in my living room amazing man amazing
Dec 22 2023,positive,well done movie good action great characters great writing loved it cant wait till part 2 better than the last 6 star wars movies
Dec 22 2023,negative,honestly i tried to come into this movie with excitement and was quickly let down i dont get how various other reviews call this movie epic of all things cause while the movie looks pretty gorgeous the writing and acting are absolutely atrocious while there are a lot of elements borrowed from other sci fi films rebel moon falls flat on its face with confusing writing and to be frank it failed to keep my attention just 3545 minutes in the main character is poorly written as well i might try to give this movie another chance in the near future but for now this just aint it
Dec 22 2023,positive,movie is solid for story and character building of a saga not the most creative movie but it is very well made the cast is interesting with some bright spots and some actors clearly picked based on what they look like and not how they can portray a charactermostly the oiled up weird one
Dec 22 2023,positive,this is what zak schnider dows best
Dec 22 2023,negative,this movie is your basic rehashing of the kurosawa movie seven samurai but they replaced the character development with a  half explained universe of intergalactic conquest slow motion shots straight out of 300 and fairly good use of cg that plays off of star wars archetypes     i give the actors a a lot of credit for doing so well considering the actors didnt get any help from the ai constructed drivel that they called a script the acting and eye candy visuals are the sole reason to watch this movie
Dec 22 2023,positive,solid characters and story   enough of a back story to lay the ground work to be engaged but definitely wanting more  good start to the franchise
Dec 22 2023,positive,the film is exceptional  everything is there the scenario the soundtrack the actors the sound and the image despite some slightly botched inlays  i advise you to see it and cant wait for the sequel
Dec 22 2023,negative,it was meh didnt hate it but didnt love it no real action the only real action was hero shots where the frame the heroine doing something but no real substance or lead up to the action movie was so predictable story felt like a watered down version of magnificent seven i love all the actors and actresses but they can only do so much with bad direction and a shitty script
Dec 22 2023,positive,critics suck at judging movies this was a damn good one actually anticipating the second yet it is so bittersweet because you can see if zack actually got star warseven then its truly now overrated the story isnt great and its never been good other than visually being real about it it would have been badass and great storytelling is great but i can say its hard to watch without thinking damn we could have gotten a decent star wars trilogy outta this guy
Dec 22 2023,positive,the movie is great the story is good visuals are fines yes it looks like something weve seen before but does not  i found here everything i loved from all the movies i liked before watch it without thinking about press critics
Dec 22 2023,negative,so lame visually striking at times but its obvious the creator just took his favorite scenes from star wars lotr and some action movies and smashed them together tons of poor attempts at deep dramatic moments all smashed together make the movie feel shallow and weak you cant take every deep moment from ypur favorite movies and string them all together one after the other and expect it to land as if it had a whole movies worth if buildup dont waste your time watching this literally write your own star wars fan fic and it will be more entertaining
Dec 22 2023,positive,i had so much fun great cast and character design great action and beware of the  kings gaze surprisingly it was more emotional than i expected 
Dec 22 2023,negative,the only redeeming quality of this movie is the stunning visual effects everything elses is trash
Dec 22 2023,negative,hitchhikers guide to the galaxy mixed with total recall the arnie version vibes wouldve been an awesome 90s movie they really needed to make ol mate put a shirt on too i am pretty sure its cold in space didnt connect with any of the characters as they didnt give us a chance or a reason to wanted to see more of the robot though but he literally just runs off right when it got interesting for 30 seconds story is muddled and is just the same old david vs goliath trope that has been done to death especially in these space operas putting some lack luster actions scenes in slow mo didnt make them cool that worked great in 300 but this was meant to be an epic space battle and it really wasnt it needed so much more all hype and zero substance if it was a star wars saga youd buy in for the nostalgia and familiarity but on its own offers little to nothing to make you want to go back for more if your short on time just watch the previews you get the entire story and the best bits of the action literally ill still watch part 2 probably for some closure and hope of redemption however it doesnt even end with a cliffhanger or hook to entice you back bitterly dissapointed because i wanted it to be as good as the promo team made it out to be
Dec 22 2023,negative,if you want to see a better movie just watch magnificent seven or battle beyond the stars because theres not in the original idea in this movie and all the battle scenes are in slow motion which result in terrible action sequences
Dec 22 2023,positive,i expected average for this movie since action flick stories have been generic and recycled a lot while rebel moon isnt unique at all in terms of storytelling it delivered a lot of curious moments and particularly great twists at the end    being invested on the characters of this band of misfits i was totally surprised to find and learned some exciting little details on the backstory of every member of the group that the female main protagonist had gathered    it seems this movie is cooking up some appetizing worldbuilding adventure in the future and i feel its promise i want more     as for this first part i love it it has some flaws but for the sake of storytelling and all its gripping moments it was well worth my time and interest    looking forward to the second part
Dec 22 2023,positive,visually stunning not to mention entertaining as hell sci fi tropes arent bad if used correctly critics seemed to have missed this point either on purpose or by lack of competence
Dec 22 2023,positive,really good science fiction movie
Dec 22 2023,positive,this is an absolute epic the characters visuals action everything is just epic
Dec 22 2023,neutral,great visuals couple forgettable characters unfortunately not to memorable hopeful the directors cut part 2 is better
Dec 22 2023,positive,the movie had awesome visuals and cinematography i think the purpose of this movie was to set up the universe and it did it well however it missed many opportunities to develop some cool characters it was set in space it had action it had a nice vibe im all in
Dec 22 2023,positive,fun movie to watch  wonderful cinematography kinda a mix of warhammer and star wars good plot with a few nice twists  for me this is an easy 5 just an entertaining exciting visually eye candy scifi story fun stuff  i was entertained    note if you dont like scifiadventure type movies or lean too hard into this movie you will end up agreeing with the critics score
Dec 22 2023,positive,fantastic worth the watch cant wait for pt 2
Dec 22 2023,neutral,a very interesting approach at merging multiple scifi movies into one however the transitions are very awkward and gives off a very sky pirate vibe i would have appreciated less of those slow motion takes that happen every 5 minutes in the movie could have helped save that time and used it towards delivering a more fulfilling ending vs a rushed one
Dec 22 2023,negative,i would say its a shotbyshot ripoff of star wars but its missing any of the heart or humanity of star wars just exposition and battle scenes
Dec 22 2023,negative,absolutely terrible i waited for this movie because i thought the trailers and special effects looked great but it turned out to be just complete trash the story is boring and so simple it could have been written by a child the acting is cringey and breaking it into 2 parts makes it even worse because it makes no sense what a disappointment i still cant believe it has such a high fan review please make better scifi in the future because this movie kills the scifi industry its not the industry its just this movie that sucks make more scifi
Dec 22 2023,negative,visually not awful but that is probably one of the only reasons why i pushed through and finished this movie this movie was bad they tried so hard to be iconic but nothing about this movie was iconic acting was meh dialog was meh story was extra meh i hope they decide not to make the other 2 after this
Dec 22 2023,positive,rebel moon dazzles with its striking visuals offering a feast for the eyes that elevates the entire cinematic experience the films storyline while rooted in a promising concept unfortunately treads a path too familiar leading to a sense of predictability that slightly diminishes its overall impact despite this the movies strong visual elements and engaging premise make it a worthwhile watch for fans of the genre
Dec 22 2023,negative,bad script b tier acting and retelling the seven samurai in star wars universe with warhammer 40k costume
Dec 22 2023,negative,okay its a cyberpunk visually exhausting version of star wars in which avatar korra has to defend a farming village and to do so she gathers together a gang made up of charmless han solo hippogrifftaming native american anakin skywaler the emo version of crouching tiger hidden dragon shazans wizard anyone else oh yes xander harris from buffy but anyway you can pass the time
Dec 22 2023,negative,i made an account just to say that am in minute 61 and it is bad it is really really bad
Dec 22 2023,negative,bad rehash of the magnificent 7 but worse than battle beyond the stars half the lines i have heard in other movies the plot is so predictable you can guess who killed  the king  before 12 the movie is over and i am sure they will not reveal that till   half way  through part 2
Dec 22 2023,positive,honestly a lot like the first star wars movies but with a better story an graphics   cant wait for part 2  the movie start to finish is a lot of fun action packed an they build the characters very well  i think a lot of their back storys will come out in part 2  but what you get on them in part 1 is enough to like an keep the pace going 
Dec 22 2023,positive,watched it the family and it is good i dont really know why it gets a lot of hate but me and my family enjoyed it cant wait to see part 2
Dec 22 2023,positive,great movie adventure awesome world building innovative sciencefi wonderful visuals a story seen many times but uniquely adapted to this world had grit to it you could almost feel the power of the weapons used i had heard the negative reviewsdont believe them if you dont like fantastical stories or zack snyders way of directing then this isnt for you its uniquely inspiring honestly ready for part 2 now my highest praise
Dec 22 2023,positive,great the special effects are on point also the story is interesting
Dec 22 2023,positive,it is a great movie story is great and so are the effects i do wish though that we had the directors cut instead of the shorter theater cut so we have more of the story
Dec 22 2023,negative,the visuals were good but not amazing and that for me was the only good thing about this movie the plot is stale the pacing terrible the caracther work abysmal the few plotwist badly managed or easily predictable leaves you with lots of loose ends that cant be justified just by the movie being a part 1 would not recommend
Dec 22 2023,negative,visually it is great however that doesnt save it from the poor dialogue and script great actors for the most part but the dialogue felt clunky throughout borrows from various different scifi genres but ultimately does not seem to be able to establish its own identify or make me care about any of the characters or the overall world setting  predicatble and
Dec 22 2023,negative,this ridiculous fan fiction based on star wars is a complete waste of time and ridiculous fantasy of zach schneiderthere is no coherent plot  and we dont follow any specific character for any length of time and he just interjects a bunch of characters and droids and beings from other franchises such as droids orcs and even buckbeak from harry potter i cannot tell if this is supposed to be serious it is the worst thing i have ever had to watch and i cant believe i made it through to the end nothing about this is original interesting good and dit is just copyright infringement and mimicry in the most poor form i have ever seen in my entire f life
Dec 22 2023,positive,basically a sci fi version of seven samurai and the magnificent seven i know this is part one of two but i feel rebel moon wouldve worked much better as a series rather than a two part movie a child of fire felt so rushed imo characters werent fleshed out enough and there was way too much exposition that i felt wouldve worked better in a series but thats just me the visuals are fun to watch but honestly thats about it ill be curious how i feel after i watch the scargiver
Dec 22 2023,neutral,the movie felt like it missed huge plot developments  it felt rushed at the wrong point  visually well done  editing felt like they made it so they could release a director cut next year
Dec 22 2023,negative,cringe characters  opening scene with saturn like planet painted onto a backdrop  not sure if even the visuals were up to par on this one  it felt low budget  but probably cost a fortune to make
Dec 22 2023,positive,the first 15 minutes are fine the rest of the movie never really earns the scenes it tries to pull off too much happens too fast and the pacing quickly becomes a disjointed rush and it puts a lot on the viewers to bridge the gaps all things considered this probably should have been a 4 parter its enough to want what the vision for the film was and despite its short comings i am still looking forward to part 2
Dec 22 2023,positive,this website is terrible people need to stop using it as a source to see if something is good or not    this film on the other hand is rather bloody good i honestly dont really have many complaints only the main one is that it shied away from the blood too much its a 15 why did it do this
Dec 22 2023,positive,its a decent movie incredible world building i cant wait for the second part horribly underrated by critics
Dec 22 2023,positive,this move is excellent too bad that this was supposed to be part of star wars narrative is out there since does only damage by star wars fans visuals here are epic even better than any of the recent star wars movies editing could have been done better but as far as i understand this cut is missing huge chunk of the movie it must be accounted for that when watching it cant wait for directors cut
Dec 22 2023,positive,great fkn movie great story line visually stunning
Dec 22 2023,positive,beautiful and stunning imagery as usual its an introduction story so i wasnt expecting them to just dive right in but the way it was told was brilliant each character their own arc i really enjoyed will rewatch many times
Dec 22 2023,positive,i have been watching  reading scifi for 60 years i really like space operas i thought this movie was fun with a good story
Dec 22 2023,negative,if youre here to watch an original new franchise set in space then dont bother watching the vast majority of this movies worldbuilding is almost onetoone plagiarism of dune
Dec 22 2023,positive,as always with zack snyders films rebel moon is visually stunning with great actionpacked scenes and music     the only negative thing i could find with the film was the 2nd act you can definitely tell there was many scenes cut from it there will be a director cut later on that im sure will fix this problem cutting these scenes made seem like what was a great story to a straightforward story
Dec 22 2023,positive,i loved it but i usually love most scifi showsmovies im looking forward to part 2 and the directors cut tba
Dec 22 2023,positive,solid performances interesting and adequately told story good special effects perfectly crafted action scenes everything i look for in a science fiction film
Dec 22 2023,negative,waste of time dull predictable
Dec 22 2023,neutral,well add rebel moon to the long list of disappointing movies of the 2020s  i have no idea why it wasnt billed as what it is it is 100 battle beyond the stars or 7 samurai in space   it suffers from tme  too much exposition while at the same time snipping interesting stories immediately   the costume design ranges from amazing to as bad as farscape and despite the wonderful cast manages to delivery lame ass dialogue
Dec 22 2023,negative,looked great actings good enough story is okay the movie was so very dull just one big intro for the second movie id guess which is a shame because i wont tune in for it
Dec 22 2023,positive,great set up for whats to come thoroughly enjoyed this movie i cant wait for part 2
Dec 22 2023,positive,entertaining but for as long as it was it felt rushed to me very little character development aside from the main protagonist
Dec 22 2023,positive,artistic engaging and entertaining i like the concept for the world they are building and it is a solid foundation    i think the critics lately are so wrong in so many movies i go by audience rating more often because they are more accurate    i cant wait to see the full cut
Dec 22 2023,negative,whew this was pretty badsuper cheezy and boring
Dec 22 2023,positive,this movie was clunky and it felt like scenes were missing which i hope the rated r version fixes that but the movie is visually gorgeous every scene was shot beautifully and you can see how much care was put into it
Dec 22 2023,negative,so terrible in so many ways
Dec 22 2023,negative,zack had me from the opening credits yes finally a proper science fiction movie its been so long let me say this visually this film was amazing but its as if zack made gumbo from several films of the past but he never learned how to make a roux there is not enough flavor to this film not enough soul its very hard to stay interested it took me four times to be able to finish the film visually a delight but overall another disappointment
Dec 22 2023,positive,i know it may not be much but hear me out rebel moon a child of fire is wild ambitious and entertaining giving everyone an action packed first chapter to an even bigger story
Dec 22 2023,negative,rebel moon is a blend of warhammer 40k imperials and the magnificent seven the chris pratt one the design is great and so are the visuals the story and motivations though is a mess after 2 hours and 14 minutes nothing has been accomplished and we are pretty much back where the movie started     if you want to enjoy this try not to think to hard about anything otherwise you will probably turn it off after less than 20 minutes     still hoping the second part can save this world but my hopes are low
Dec 22 2023,positive,its kinda pocahontas with star wars and with a nice cinematography i recommend to watch
Dec 22 2023,positive,definitely can feel the influences of other scifi greats however unique and entertaining would enjoy the uncut version if released looking forward to more films in this ip
Dec 22 2023,positive,i loved the movie given what the budget they had and what was turned out is amazing i dont understand why critics are being so harsh on the movie cant wait to see the next movie
Dec 22 2023,negative,so bad it almost seems intentional  80 lb young girl destroys a dozen soldiers in a barn in slow motion luckily even though the soldiers all have guns the patiently wait to attack one at a time  no story no emotion but everything looks orange
Dec 22 2023,positive,its really not that bad of a movie as the critics make it out to be  dont listen to the critics  its a pretty good set up for the next movie looking forward to the conclusion
Dec 22 2023,positive,best movie absolutely a must watch
Dec 22 2023,positive,i was going tog give it a 4  but then i saw that all critics hates it bc its not pc enough for them so now im going to give it a 5 fking hate pc critics    edit this is actually a great movie and the ppl giving it 15 cant possibly seen the same movie   but something sticks out a lot of the 1 star reviews are from ppl who only have rated this movie looks like bots
Dec 22 2023,positive,amazing visuals great lore and world building very good story and a fantastic setup for the next part eagerly waiting for part 2 and the uncut r rated directors cut the last 40 minutes is just mind blowing zack has done it again a solid 8510
Dec 22 2023,negative,its like starwars if starwars had zero charm
Dec 22 2023,positive,what a great film a really good build to what will probably be the defense of the settlement jax soa character was a bit cheezy but he is dead now so thank god for that
Dec 22 2023,positive,i thought it was great from the beginning to the end 1010 watch it
Dec 22 2023,positive,not his best work but had some interesting ideas that i enjoyed  some of those needed to be fleshed out a bit more  maybe they will in part 2 or in a longer directors cut  also the acting wasnt the best in certain scenes but i still liked most of the characters  the visuals were amazing for the most part  overall i found it entertaining and ill probably watch a second time before part 2 releases
Dec 22 2023,positive,beautiful cinematography special effects story characters universe environments just an epic movie masterpiece
Dec 22 2023,negative,cringe female lead cliche dialoges pathetic  story
Dec 22 2023,negative,youll only like rebel moon if you want to like it  and i dont think youll like it even then  theres no way to get it
Dec 22 2023,negative,really bad lots of scene where just copy of other past movie scene and the story is shitty be honest i seen a lots of movie and by far this one goes on the worst one i saw
Dec 22 2023,negative,near the beginning of the movie dont let the giant vagina with the phallic spaceship passing through it turn you off its gets a little better not much though
Dec 22 2023,negative,decent but the editing felt as if they have completely skipped important plot details
Dec 22 2023,positive,completely raw thoughts as i watch premise is 7 samurai  dune  star wars the village and villagers are as naive and ignorant as the ones in 7 samurai the motherworld army  space nazis actually more like space soviets are ruthless as the empires  first orders troopers replace the protagonists of star wars with 7 samurai replace 12 the plot of star wars with 7 samurai instead of a death star and farm boy becoming a jedi its farmers and outcasts vs space warmongers ngl i also see some references to like clash of the titans when tarak tarzan duh side note dude looks like he could pull off as tarzan was riding the bennu similary to how perseus was riding pegasus dunno why this movie also gives me warhammer vibes probably the outfits and weapons also gives me bungie games vibes especially d2 from how some of the lore is presented some of the cg scenes kinda feels like game cutscenes or sortta like cg from tron but thats fair enough considering tech advances and budget some of the movements and skills tbh im fine with slomo scenes in films i feel like there were some moments where its unecessary or a little too much love the twist with kai side note rewatch 7 samurai if there was ever a betrayal like this last battle between kora and noble reminds me of rogue one the scene when all 6 of them were sidebyside was for sure a call back to zsjl  jl ending where the 6 were together noble definitly got darth vader treatment at the end 2nd chance at life by his master cant wait to see the threat hell become next scoring is great overall for context 7 samurai was like 3 and 12 hours long so this film would ofc feel incomplete without its part 2 since the premise is pretty much 7 samurai overall id say it was a good film if the cut  r version is better when it releases ill revisit scoring
Dec 22 2023,positive,the movie is a spectacle for sure  there is a bit too much feeling of a montage through the middle of the movie and it would benefit from some more development of the main cast perhaps cutting out one or two and saving them for the sequel  id really like to see the extended cut definitely coming back for part two
Dec 22 2023,positive,tired of hearing it rips off star wars just cause its in space and good vs evil its an excellent first part loved it
Dec 22 2023,positive,i watched this movie last night and greatly enjoyed it i was engrossed in the beautifully rendered world the dialogue character development and visuals are top notch ignore the critics ands see this one for yourself the is chapter 1 in an immense and engaging world i cant wait to see more
Dec 22 2023,positive,great movie great action awesome start  cant wait for the r rated version to drop
Dec 22 2023,positive,this was great set up for a scifi epic cannot wait for part 2
Dec 22 2023,positive,the crawling mechanisms they used to detain people were sick     the scene in the bar where the alien creature was using the human as a surrogate was surreal     the droid was surprisingly wholesome in the scene with the young girl definitely needed more screen time    theres alot of creative details to marvel at in this space opera
Dec 22 2023,positive,really exciting movie great story and characters some special effects arent perfect but still looking good im hyped for part two
Dec 22 2023,positive,a great intro into the new universe of rebel moon you get the star wars vises you get the 7 samuraj vibes and it all works visual stunning and a story that really puts you on alert with some interesting twistes the store is a slamdunk and junkie xl really delivers on a high note the pg13 version you can tell has some loops and holes in it regarding story but the directors cut and part 2 will according to information solve that    i really enjoyed this new ip and i cannot wait for part 2 and the dc cut
Dec 22 2023,positive,im not a fan of scifi movies but this movie really changed my perspective from the story to the visuals score like damn this movie really touched me might look out the director of this movie and watch more of his content
Dec 22 2023,negative,why  yikes  the trailer looked bad  the show is worse
Dec 22 2023,positive,it was amazing if you are into scifi youll love it
Dec 22 2023,positive,this movie is beautiful considering the budget story was good that it sets up the next movie awesome visuals and great cast cant wait for part 2
Dec 22 2023,positive,beautiful imagery and a story that makes you hunger for more not sure why the special critics dont like it
Dec 22 2023,positive,amazing action sequences and the sound was incredible loved the artistic use of images while world building and the slow motion shots to create a sense of intensity also the weapons held a major upgrade of lethality over star wars blasters the laser projectiles and sound emitted from them was fantastic
Dec 22 2023,positive,an absolute epic movie i loved every second of it it has everything you could ask for in a movie zack snyders has brought us another masterpiece i am looking forward to part 2 
Dec 22 2023,positive,pros  good visuals good fights acting is good music is okay  cons  no character buildup bad editing fights are very short not a gripping story     but will definitely watch part 2
Dec 22 2023,negative,just terrible couldnt finish
Dec 22 2023,positive,pure excellence zack has created another masterpiece performances cinematography costumes cgi was amazing cant wait for part 2
Dec 22 2023,positive,dark scifi greatness
Dec 22 2023,negative,abysmal indulgent and clichéd
Dec 22 2023,negative,this was a 135 minute unskippable cutscene
Dec 22 2023,neutral,the movie had potential i think my main issue is the fact that the characters still fall victim to zacks tendency of portraying people as regal kinda mechanic macho rigid characters it makes it difficult to sympathize with any and makes the bad acting more glaring the bad dialogues didnt help either i think if a better writer had polished the script a bit we might have had much better movie all the same ill watch anything zack puts out  because his aesthetics are 2nd to none 255
Dec 22 2023,positive,enjoyed the ride it is kind of a star wars ripoff but still good  we need an adult version rated r then it would be great
Dec 22 2023,positive,this movie  was great the characters are amazing the movie looks beautiful he created a wonderful universe watch it the critics are wrong about this one
Dec 22 2023,positive,not as bad as the professional critics say id say if your into scifi its worth giving a chance id have rated it higher but some scenes really needed a bit more dialog be aware the cast is heavy in the c list category
Dec 22 2023,positive,solid action interesting cast believable acting and way more fun than starwars would recommend
Dec 22 2023,neutral,this is exactly what you get if you wanted a grim dark star wars in the same vein as chronicles of riddick  acting and visuals are okay though it feels like half the movie is a slow motion action scene  i had high hopes for a space opera like mass effect but this fell short did have a few good moments but honestly felt like someone had written a teenage fantasy novel and decided to market it as a scifi  worth a watch if you have a spare few hours but hardly stacks up to some of the other recent scifi movies or shows currently out there lets hope the second part packs more of a punch
Dec 22 2023,negative,exposition back story orange slow motion  exposition back story orange slow motion  expo you get the idea    its a decent popcorn movie to pass time with the pace of a series though maybe thats the slow motion talking  because its just way too over done every action scene is 5060 slomo    many scenes feel like they were born from a wouldnt it be cool if conversation between college freshmen just didnt stick with me
Dec 22 2023,negative,kind of nice to look at but extremely boring and derivative of better scifi epics characters are cardboard and get no development the bad guys are the same space nazis youve seen a million times
Dec 22 2023,positive,cant wait for the next one
Dec 22 2023,negative,rebel moon is a terrible movie that copies from better movies and ruins them the movie is full of star wars references but they are lame and boring it is about a girl who fights an evil empire with a laser sword a halfvampire prince who is a ripoff of blade a spider queen who is a match up of queen of the damned and charlottes web a nazi who is a ripoff of schindlers list and a robot who is a ripoff of bicentennial man not to mention the highlight was the action sequence from a ripoff mulan meets asajj ventress it  is also full of starships that look weird ripoff mcu the movies aesthetics and sounds are also ripoff of dune but they are dull and annoying wish i can have those 2hrs back
Dec 22 2023,negative,originality lost in the shadows of the moon
Dec 22 2023,positive,stellar movie and a great star wars competitor
Dec 22 2023,positive,i thought it was a good movie better than the last four star wars at least they should have let him do this in the star wars franchise
Dec 22 2023,negative,i love the science fiction and fantasy genres and expected this to tick alot of boxes for me but boy this definitely didnt feel like a cinematic experience    the writing lazy characters are all two dimensional and every twist is super predictable dont get me wrong it has moments that have genuinely intrigued to see how they will play out in the second installment but those moments account for approximately 5 percent of the movie oh and some of the effects would have easily been at home in the early 2000s had to remind myself during one particular scene that i was not in fact watching an anime show     sadly the whole film feels incredibly rushed and what could have been great became a predictable poorly written piece of mediocrity
Dec 22 2023,positive,its was just fun to watch reminded me of oldschool action flicks i loved back in the day i am excited for the next one
Dec 22 2023,positive,this was an amazing movie absolutely the best movie of 2023 cant really say to much more without giving spoilers
Dec 22 2023,positive,great story building and beautiful shots it was a bit too short though i feel like this should have been a 58 episode series instead and give each character recruitment a full arc and story
Dec 22 2023,positive,it was good but it a old school star wars day like late 90s star wars it was enjoyable this was a few scenes that was rush but some of cgi and vfx were not good but only like for 2 scenes but i give it a rating 7310
Dec 22 2023,negative,this felt more like watching a video game of the characters back stories  if you enjoy watching spacecrafts takeoff and land you will love this flick  and dont get me started on the overuse of random slowmotion  oh and did i mention the strange gazing between characters its like they are hiding a funny side joke 
Dec 22 2023,positive,its called part one and thats what it is plus some beautiful world building great action scene well designed characters and lore the downside for most a believe is simply expecting to see the big climax of story but this is the build part one so watch it with this in mind just like dune part one this is the world builder in saying that im very excited to see the r18 directors cut that will flesh the world out even more and really show the devastation of battle scenes its a good time
Dec 22 2023,positive,enjoyed this film quite a bit i really gravitated towards the main character i thought boutella was excellent the film couldve been much longer and delved into the other characters a bit more but i still loved the universe the story the film score by junkiexl as well as the action scenes that is really given us something to get excited about as a film series
Dec 22 2023,positive,i think there is a persecution of snider because every film he makes critics say a lot of bad things about it but his films are good
Dec 22 2023,neutral,some of the choreography in the action scenes was great sophia boutella gets the job done but the dialogue was cheesy and too much of the storytelling was in the form of exposition
Dec 22 2023,positive,movie was amazing simple story with amazing world and lore the characters are amazing too just we could get to know the bit more maybe if it was an 1 hour maybe it would be good but other then that a good move for charismas
Dec 22 2023,positive,its fine certainly better then the last 2 star wars trilogy movies
Dec 22 2023,positive,solid 810 movie entertaining beautiful visually and a great score cant wait for the directors cut and part 2
Dec 22 2023,positive,it was kind of fresh to have a new universe to enjoy like if you are a bit tired of the superhero genre it was fun and some really good visuals alot of entertainment wich was nice and it felt like almost to short that fast   also nice pacing and liked the way it evolved
Dec 22 2023,positive,i love the first installment of this movie i thought that each character brought something unique and vital in order to fully round out the crew the universe is awesome and i just want to know more about it cant wait for part two
Dec 22 2023,negative,shocking movie  visual effects were decent but the overal story and more worrying the acting were terrible
Dec 22 2023,positive,where do i start   visually stunning   from the start had me tugging at my heart strings especially over jimmy the robot   being over 2 hours long and still left me wanting more   cant wait to see whats next in part two   well done
Dec 22 2023,negative,utter incompetence at every level  writingproducing directing and acting cheap and dreary looking despite its cost whole scenes and characters stolen from other better movies actors who seem like they would rather be anywhere else
Dec 22 2023,positive,epic starwars killer 1010
Dec 22 2023,positive,not as bad as what the critics are saying its not great but i had a good time watching it not a fan of all the slow mo action scenes though
Dec 22 2023,positive,comparisons to star wars are a bit lazy the movie is more low key and aimed at the streaming audience that will have more patience than legacy media the story landed really well for me and reminded me more of classic video games like homeworld than anything else i hope they make more stories in this world
Dec 22 2023,negative,feels like a bad star wars film this couldve been so good but its not i want to love the characters but theres no depth provided theres also cg moments that take you out of it they probably shouldve broken this into more parts so they had more time to develop the characters
Dec 22 2023,positive,visually amazing and good acting across the board simple prototypes and a great start escapism and engaging film it feels unkind to judge this movie so harshly but im hopeful there will be more regardless of the critic views
Dec 22 2023,negative,the visuals were mostly on the amazing side with some really bad cgi thrown in at random and lens flare for some reason but dear lord the plot and characters were terrible the dialogue was just flat and unmotivated it read like a dnd group starting an adventure without actually roleplaying their characters motivations for joining no one really resisted joining     there was no real connection with the side characters we never really saw too much of their living situations or even personality from any of them so i felt no connection to anyone involved the music was telling me to feel awed by a line delivery or a speech but the audience has no real reason to care  it was disappointing to be told things and not shown them you want to tell me the general is a tactical genius okay but he didnt do any thing to warrant that description  exposition dump on koras backstory you tell me shes a badass and her flashbacks sometimes reflect that but she has stormtrooper aim     also we were shown the dreadnaught can fire bomb a planet from orbit it seems supremely silly for farmers to fight it maybe they should have been looking for a whole fleet of pirates to take on the warhammer 40k ship    i felt genuinely bad for tarak though no one thought to give him a shirt all movie he went from desert planet to the cold of space no shirt
Dec 22 2023,positive,enjoyed very much thank you
Dec 22 2023,positive,this movie was a really fun ride the universe feels lived in and the action scenes are cool yes i turned my brain off and i enjoyed a movie lots of loose ends they make introduce every character as if they were super important and dont do much with them after but theres 2 more movies and now i cant wait to watch them
Dec 22 2023,positive,seriously i dont know why the critics gave this low ratingsrebel moon is so awesome loved everything in it cant wait for the directors cut  part 2
Dec 22 2023,positive,absolutely loved the movie the cinematography and obviously the world building  waiting for 2nd part
Dec 22 2023,negative,oofff is this a ripoff of seven samuri or battle beyond the stars  what else did it ripoffi saw a space battleship yamato a starship troops brain bug some furiosa eye makeup lightsabers a droid with feelings necromonger armor a borg queen a nazi officer a nice guy who sells them out thanos on some astral plane  truely amazing almost devoid of any orginality and not even a wink to the audience acknowledging it
Dec 22 2023,positive,epic finally something different part 2 is coming soon too this universe will be amazing and keep growing zack  goat
Dec 22 2023,positive,overall a good scifantasy flick its easy to point out its flaws which are only due to runtime but the good is good
Dec 22 2023,positive,it was pretty good if a bit derivative
Dec 22 2023,positive,very enjoyable scifi rollercoaster ride  i am very impressed with zacks directing skills the talented actors
Dec 22 2023,positive,this movie was pretty awesomeremember this is only part one i would highly recommend to judge yourself as we live in an age today where noone is satisfied the same anymore and everyone want you to believe their opinions and everyone wants to compare the success and bad parts of any movie to another movie they watched when they were 10 everything was better when you were 10 you were a child rebel moon has stat wars ascetics yes but its not star wars and uses action scenes and tries to tell a story even though you might not know every characters backstories on this film remember its only part onethis movie has a huge cast they do quick intro and as the movie progress we find out more about the main characters past and how she is linked to army conquering the galaxy to give much spoilers take everything everyone says with a grain of salt and judge it yourself some people are quick to say zack synder lost his way this movie doesnt get 5 stars in my book cuz for me the pacing is slow but it shows potential for part 2again if we are comparing this to star wars not every star wars movie was mind blowing people like sw episode 5 more than episode 4 and 6 some like the new trilogy some hate it most despite the disney onessome like itand we all still think as a whole sw is amazing give rebel moon a chance and judge yourself
Dec 22 2023,positive,a very exhilarating movie from beginning to end  i couldnt keep my eyes off the screen with all the visuals and sounds  the story was a bit clunky but enjoyable nonetheless 
Dec 22 2023,positive,i swear this movie was a star wars film its so similar i did enjoy it but i probably wont watch part 2 due to the wait
Dec 22 2023,positive,sci fi action film that felt fresh but also familiar great evening entertainment
Dec 22 2023,positive,i like it i was hooked in the 1st 30mins cant wait for part 2
Dec 22 2023,positive,this is an amazing movie  i cant wait for part 2 and the dc beautiful and wished it was 4 hours long
Dec 22 2023,positive,rebel moon is a great scifi cinema with the story progression giving its just part 1 its a thrilling adventure that keeps you engaged especially with the fight scenes and interesting storytelling     fans of star wars also to anyone who loves a good story and amazing movie should watch it i cant wait for part 2 in april 2024
Dec 22 2023,negative,this was a movie i was looking forward to but just found it boring just another generic scifi movie
Dec 22 2023,positive,i went in with low expectations given the critic reviews but damn was i surprised how good this universe is very lifelike and heartfelt
Dec 22 2023,positive,so much to unpack definitely need a rewatch but man can it be april already i need more of this
Dec 22 2023,positive,i genuinely loved this movie its the scifi space opera that i have been waiting for definitely gives off star wars vibes and i love it even if the out of touch critics do not
Dec 22 2023,positive,rebel moon looked great and when it took its time had great writing the first act is paced very well and focuses on world building while the third act feels very rushed there is a directors cut coming that will hopefully fix some of the pacing issues and add to some of the side characters the main villian of this film was excellent in his role
Dec 22 2023,positive,honestly i think the reviews are kind of harsh i thought it was entertaining and i look forward to watching the 2nd one
Dec 22 2023,positive,just one word incredible 
Dec 22 2023,negative,sooo not good dialogue not great muddled character motivations so not good
Dec 22 2023,neutral,visually its like the heavy metal magazine come to life looking forward to the directors cut because this trimmed version feels half baked not nearly as bad as everyone is saying but also not his best work a for effort and creating something new ie derivative of other things weve seen before but at least hes trying
Dec 22 2023,negative,just boring i think zack is great at visual aspects but when it comes to story aspects he sucks just let other writers create decent stories for hi watchmen was great because the original story had been already great and zack added visual depth to it he cannot write thats the obvious fact at this moment i mean you remember how bad the script for batman v superman right
Dec 22 2023,positive,i really enjoyed this part one of the rebel moon saga the critics have been way too harsh this movie has some amazing visuals yes it lacks a form of character building and feels a little incomplete but its part one and there is a directors cut that awaits i did however really like being in this universe and i can see the audience scoring rising much hire in the next week  this movie reminded me of 300 in space and i really enjoyed it for that it sure did fly by which means i was having a good time so im gonna give it a score that rates my experience give us scargiver please
Dec 22 2023,positive,its fun i love zack snyders movies but i honestly expected much much more the story felt too superficial i couldnt connect with it still a fun movie
Dec 22 2023,negative,2hour character presentation with uninteresting characters and plot that is only a prelude to the second part with a lot of elements taken from other movies  with good cinematography and cool special effects that still cannot save a terrible script
Dec 22 2023,positive,just finished and  i loved it the world building was so engaging  it gave so much context into what was happening the characters were fully developed this was so much more movie than the sw prequels
Dec 22 2023,positive,not a perfect movie but a good  start to a new franchise i think it would have worked better as a series and had more character development the recruiting seemed a bit rushed and unrealistic i give it 35 for effort will certainly be watching part 2
Dec 22 2023,positive,rebel moon astounds with its breathtaking visuals unveiling a mesmerizing new universe boasting an exceptional cast delivering stellar performances it diverges from conventional space sagas its thoughtprovoking species and gripping storyline leave audiences eagerly anticipating the next installmentthe critics are wrong a must see
Dec 22 2023,positive,i love zack snyders flair and directing style the acting is great the cast is great i was engrossed through out the whole movie i love that each character has their own motive to join
Dec 22 2023,positive,perhaps the critics would prefer the disney renditions of the marvel universe which are generally not even worth watching any more but the low ratings for this movie are nonsensical rebel moon is not perfect but it is pretty damn good and so much better than most everything in the theaters since dune
Dec 22 2023,neutral,awesome visually first 20 minutes were great characters werent developed at all it felt like you took a 10 hour movie and cut it down to 2 12 leaving a jumbled mess 
Dec 22 2023,negative,some cool bits some visual set pieces like the planets were very nice the plot is straighter than a roman road with any slight deviations telegraphed from miles away   massively overused slow mobullet time so that when it should have been poignantimportant it just wasnt     spoiler          somehow francis returned
Dec 22 2023,positive,way better than those critics do people seriously pay for their opinions is that a real job regardless their reviews are worthless and this is by far infinitely better than the sequel films
Dec 22 2023,negative,it was like giving a teenager a couple hundred million to make a movie shallow predictable and blatantly derivative could have been so much better with an ounce of thought given to the storyline a bit more realism and dialogue not written by children
Dec 22 2023,positive,had a slow start at first due to backstop then got good
Dec 22 2023,positive,lower your expectations it was enjoyable and was a good first half of a 2 part movie best movie ever no grab some popcorn and enjoy it for what it is
Dec 22 2023,positive,this movie is  good  not great not perfect but its off to a good start i will watch part 2  get past zach synders compulsion to overuse slowmotion and the action scenes are good too  he does love slowmo tho
Dec 22 2023,positive,an awesome space epic with brilliant action and world building can definitely see that scenes were cut from the film to keep its pg13 rating so i am definitely looking forward to the extended r rated version and part 2  definitely form your own opinion by watching this movie
Dec 22 2023,positive,its a solid scifi experience there just something off that doesnt deserve 5 stars the cgi is not the best along with lighting way to much slow motion effects solid story but bad character development
Dec 22 2023,negative,boring rehash of so many movies characters and plot point are like he just scrapped tvtropes with an ai watched it twice trying to figure out why i should care about the characters still couldnt remember half of their names if you just want snyders aesthetic and dont care if the plots engaging its probably for you  just watch any of his better older films this one is tired
Dec 22 2023,positive,great movie and a fantastic start to this epic franchise cant wait for the directors cut of part one and for part 2
Dec 22 2023,positive,i didnt fall asleep i always fall asleep and i love me some high budget sci fi  fantasy
Dec 22 2023,positive,loved it     the critics especially on this site are liars     watch it for yourself i love serious films like oppenheimer and killers of the flower moon but this is a movie i can engage with and have fun watching this is my star wars i couldnt ever get into star wars but i loved this movie and cant wait for the sequels and more
Dec 22 2023,negative,zack snider is like a music video director and i will explain    he is not in the service of the story what he does is try to create cinematic moments but he cant mix his attempts at continus cinematic moments in the editing room as none of them match each other in tones colors or ambiences  it worked great in 300 as he only had 1 storyline to tell but as soon as you add a second one it becomes harder             if you watch a kpop or rap music video and you have people dancing to it most of the time these people cant dance pretty well so they make cuts like in a fight scene where people cant really fight to present them in their best light and here is where it bogs down    the lighting for all these scenes never has any continuity as the scenes lighting is reset to regive the best light for the next cut of that scene there is no shadow game to emphasize the story telling and what you are getting is a picture that moves instead of a scene  if you look carefully at the different angles of camera happening in the same scene you will notice that the shadows are not in the same place on the actors and the sets behind them as the scene goes on      now if you take that moving picture and use a volume screen green screen or cgi the lighting that is already not working is really not working in the completed scene as the entire lighting isnt matching and that give you that feeling of coldness which is now the trademark of snider          that blue or redorange hue that he is known for isnt a signature skill its what happens when you desaturate reduce exposure and crank the contrast up in your video editing software to hide imperfections in your footage    speaking of color grading in this movie its all over the place you will notice that we jump from an orange hue in one scene to a blue hue then to a classic cinematic hue in an other without any reasons for it   in movie making the use of these hues are there to emphasize the mood of a scene or a story line it could be also used to differentiate locations but in this movie the changes are done for no apparent reasons and sometimes in the same fucking scene     this is why besides the script and the acting this movie is unwatchable there is no redeeming qualities to it    if you take other snider movies they all had redeeming quality   in 300 the script was garbage but the visuals saved the movie cinematic moments  in man of steel the script wasnt great but the visuals until the final fight scene saved the movie plus its fucking superman cinematic moments  in the watchmen the script saved the movie as the acting was atrocious     not in this movie nothing can save it

Dec 22 2023,positive,its a beatiful movie  i love this moon
Dec 22 2023,positive,i dont get the hate this movie was awesome rich lore great lead stunning visuals and a truly menacing villain the complaints about it being a star wars ripoff are overblown however the movie makes no secret of its influences and wears them proudly on its  sleeve cant wait for part two
Dec 22 2023,positive,restored my faith in sci fi gravity over irony great actors classic tale nothing cutesy just 100 enthralling adventure expected to hate shocked to totally love
Dec 22 2023,positive,im onboard for a franchise it reminded me why i liked star wars originally but did what disney is afraid to do and added a little john wick 300 type edge i loved how the characters were introduced removed all the fluff took me on a lovehate rollercoaster i will spend my money on this franchise give me more as soon as possible thank you
Dec 22 2023,negative,should we spend more time on storyline and dialogue    nah pretty sure pointless action will do as long as we make it look cool the dialogue can be super contrived with a plot that is meh    should we a least make the action scenes somewhat believable within the scifi realm of our own creation    nah    so we basically assume the audience is super dumb and wont care    exactly
Dec 22 2023,positive,visually stunning mild story pacing issues but overall made me feel like i was watching warhammer 40k star wars and that was fine all of the tech and species of aliens and cultures definitely have me hoping theres an extended universe or franchise that comes
Dec 22 2023,positive,a fresh take on a group of rebels taking on the forces of an empire awesome visual fx score and sound editing the film is a beautiful masterpiece and i cant wait to see part two
Dec 22 2023,negative,they slow mod the slow mo this was just bad as a sci fi fanatic i wanted to enjoy this film oh so much it was an immediate disappointment it was then hilarious to make fun of until well it wasnt
Dec 22 2023,positive,rebel moon cuts a critical path through an immense livedin universe with history and drops plenty of inside references to events people and places just beyond our current horizons to tantalize viewers for the future all while delivering a cohesive narrative that is incredibly fun to watch
Dec 22 2023,positive,overall i enjoyed it  its rare we get new ips in general let alone a new space epic with hints of dune and warhammer 40k as inspiration  the only thing i wish was improved is character development  we really dont have a good idea of who the heroes are  i honestly didnt even know most of their names until the end of the film  looks like more character insights will come in part 2 based off the trailer  looking forward to it
Dec 22 2023,positive,this movie is old school fun meets new school technology  dont listen to the critics its clearly a part one which should excite viewers for the second part rather than feel it is far too openended as some reviews suggest the story is not the best ever written but lets not pretend some of our favorite cultural films have been the best of the best rebel moon is worth your time
Dec 22 2023,negative,what in the world did i just watch this movie is soulless cold and utterly shallow am i supposed to care about any of these characters the pacing is a mess theres almost no meaningful character development and the visual effects look very cheap and unfinished ive played video games with more realistic visual effects this movie is so obviously a cheap knock off its no wonder disney passed on this
Dec 22 2023,positive,critics are crazy that movie was awesome style to spare cool characters incredible effects and design just flat out cool
Dec 22 2023,positive,i loved this movie  while many people are complaining and calling this a star wars rip off i would have to disagree i loved all the nods to other films and the little snippets here and there from other films such as star wars dune harry potter and probably so many more i honestly look forward to watching it again and seeing what other pieces have been so obviously loved by the writers that they put these things into this film they have taken things that have been done before just like any other writer and film maker and spun it into something of their own while creating something new and mesmerizing i would of liked to of seen a little more characterization and build up to the extra characters that were being recruited in the film as i dont feel much level of attachment to them i felt more attachment to the spider lady with her little speech about the mines and what has been done to her i felt more   for her than a recruited good guy but overall i really liked this film a little bit of the cgi looked goofy in a few spots particularly a flying animal scene but i can overlook that i am very happy to see more scifi fantasy being made i look forward to the next installment
Dec 22 2023,positive,great adaptation of previous films for sure elements of magnificent 7 but with its own take part one is a great lore building for the 2nd part cant wait for the sequel
Dec 22 2023,positive,actually really good i wonder those credited reviewers what where they on  lol i was expecting it to be bad with their fake reviews but nope it was really good considering that its part 1  compaired to some other movies  that they gave 90 to 100 this is much better  oh yea dont forget to check those who rated it 2  stars and rated only this movie i bet those are the critics  or bots
Dec 22 2023,positive,guardians of the indiana wars cant say i hate it i will watch the rest its a familiar genere that is done very well did it blow my mind no but keep it coming because snacks are nice in between dinner
Dec 22 2023,positive,i thought it was good but honestly none of this rotten tomato stuff is really necessary you like what you like and enjoy what u enjoy its never that deepif it interests you watch it
Dec 22 2023,positive,although we all know theres a r rated cut coming the film definitely felt fast paced in the 2nd act it felt like it was just ships landing in different worlds and recruiting people after people without getting to know them and the lens that was used in movie did annoyed me but these two issues didnt affect how much i enjoyed this movie looking forward to part 2 this movie leaves you wanting more
Dec 22 2023,positive,the combataction is really well done with the injurys looking real like nobles broken arm at the end looked amazing the barn fight scene looked great not being r is what ruined it a bitthe characters are great but they just dont interact very often especially when they have created the team so more in part two i hopenoble was a scene stealer every time i saw him in a shot i just got exited such a good villain and the way they brought him back was cool i do have a lot of questions about that scene though    character development there is non at all now i know its only a part one but there has to be some to make the journey worth itthe dialogue is not very good is written very clunky and just not very good it comes of as a mouth full every time there is a interaction now i understand that hes trying to communicate a lot in one movie but that is still no excuse    overall   7510
Dec 22 2023,positive,lets start off by saying that for a new ip it is incredible the world building was exceptional and it kept me wanting to know more next comes the visuals i cannot believe both this and the sequel cost around 166m combined it makes me wonder where all the other high budget movies have been spending their money because they dont come nowhere near rebel moons quality action sequences are top notch as well although it did feel like the slow mo was used a tiny bit too liberally the character exposition was ok just not great which is what took half a star from me i feel like the extended version will fix a lot of the pacing and character exposition just like bvsue did     like many have said already ignore the critics if you are a fan of star wars mass effect just space operas in general you owe it to yourself to give this movie a shot you can decide if you like it or not after but at least give it a chance
Dec 22 2023,negative,the movie just happens its not even fun bad go to planethey come help us no yes no ok fine ill go end scene next planet    its bad like bad bad not fun acting is terrible and the dialogue is just some random words thrown together    space gladiator space conan    battlefield earth  rebel moon
Dec 22 2023,positive,great scifi epic with lots of action and beautiful scenery need to cut back a bit on the slow mo but overall fun to watch wish there was a bit more character development but maybe that will happen in future features please be rated r going forward could be more fun star wars nerds will complain but as a scifi geek this was entertaining and please make more
Dec 22 2023,negative,characters are bland and cliche the story is full of typical scifi stereotypes from dozens of other stories
Dec 22 2023,positive,started slow but oh man really good cant wait for rabel part 2
Dec 22 2023,positive,it was good you can definitely see the bones of a star wars script add a dash of magnificent 7 with a warhammer 40k coat of paint and overall you get a pretty good movie characters could have been more developed but thats my only criticism
Dec 22 2023,positive,cant wait for the r version for the not so disney adults enjoy your 50 
Dec 22 2023,positive,great start to a series what is obvious is the visual appeal what isnt obvious is mystery in every character and how the backstory of each changes the narrative with every detail revealed love it
Dec 22 2023,positive,very enjoyable looking forward to part 2
Dec 22 2023,positive,its amazing i love this movie
Dec 22 2023,positive,rebel moon part one a child of fire was gorgeous it gave me that grand space opera feel that ive been craving for a very long time this feels like seven samurai and star wars in all the best ways and i cannot wait for part two the scargiver i need the extended cut because i want to know more of this stunning new universe this has the potential to become an absolute juggernaut of a franchise and if a child of fire is the first step im with it every step of the way my one gripe is i wish i was able to see this on the big screen 4 out of 5 stars for me for the rebellion
Dec 22 2023,positive,a seven samurai worthy reimagination more than a starwars wannabe a complete universe worth to see cant wait for whats coming
Dec 22 2023,negative,filled with obvious scifi tropes from multiple franchises and does not build upon them uneven acting strange use of camera angles and out of focus filming and the now overused mary sue where the main character is a perfect and undefeated female with no development or depth the overarching story is basically blazing saddles in the star wars universe with strong warhammer 40k themes and overtones
Dec 22 2023,positive,i love zachs style it wasnt a masterpiece but the movie flowed well and was very entertaining a lot of parallels to the warhammer 40k universe which sold me on the movie right away i thought it was definitely good enough for a part one leaving plenty of room for the part to be improved upon simple answer i enjoyed the film
Dec 22 2023,positive,a fantastic start of a new space scifi universe while it does have slight pacing issues in the middle of the movie the action spectacle and word building are all worthy of immersing yourself in this new universe
Dec 22 2023,negative,characters are undeveloped and the lead actress is terrible this movie had such great potential an incredible misfire
Dec 22 2023,positive,6 star movie no doubt love the character build up only thing i didnt like is killing my man jaxs
Dec 22 2023,neutral,predictable with interesting visuals its not bad but its not great the pep talks were basic and uninspired the assembly of fighters was just as youd expect with no surprises visually this scifi world is fairly interesting the plot  dialogue however seem very typical and flat i wasnt a fan of the action scenes there was a lot of slow motion that got old pretty quickly
Dec 22 2023,negative,visually its incredible in every other wayacting story directionits just meh thats not true the acting is largely terrible
Dec 22 2023,positive,a nice epic scifi movie  cant wait for pt 2
Dec 22 2023,neutral,ive never been more bored by something so beautiful    dialogue is horrid the only saving grace is that something like warhammer 40k could work visually
Dec 22 2023,positive,i really loved this movie its super fun and a lot of action definitely worth a watch
Dec 22 2023,positive,cool scifi world that was an audio visual treat
Dec 22 2023,negative,visually stunning the costumes and art design is absolutely beautiful but was clearly been written by a child it was almost unwatchable
Dec 22 2023,positive,best scifi producto this year i want a series and more móviles i need now
Dec 22 2023,negative,it was an excruciating 2 hours i mean it is visually stunning but i really wish it had some unique storytelling or a better script
Dec 22 2023,negative,felt like nonstop plagiarism and stupidity pacing was pretty terrible cgi was terrible endless pile of tropes masquerading as a movie
Dec 22 2023,positive,movie was amazing why is everyone being so whiney about it
Dec 22 2023,positive,rebel moon movie is awesome did critics watch some other movie story building is good which makes audience to patiently wait for rebel moon part 2
Dec 22 2023,positive,so many ideas characters and scenes borrowed from other films still some fun action makes it worth a look
Dec 22 2023,positive,cant wait for part 2 and the directors cut to flesh it out which could bring it to 5 starsthis is just the beginning though which is important to remember some great moments some average moments but overall pretty cool
Dec 22 2023,positive,a great bgm with good direction made my day
Dec 22 2023,positive,after reading the critics reviewes my expectations were very low im glad i dont listen to them often i had a good time watching the movie i agree you dont get a lot of time to connect with characters but it was still cool
Dec 22 2023,positive,this was an interesting story and had its moments i must say the visuals was amazing in this movie  no darkspots and all the fighting was crystal clear i could actually see the fight scenes but with that said the world building felt rushed but i understand why because it doesnt have any other lore to go off of so they had to cram all the back stories together in this movie i would have liked to see  a character with some type of special abilities they have the  capability to fly from galaxy to galaxy but nobody have any special abilities is wild to me it wasnt anything special about the villain of the movie he actually fell pretty easily to 5 bandits which we only got to see one fight at the end which is a total bummer why go look for people to team up with and you only showcase the main character fight scenes it was pointless of having us go through the back story of the others for them to only showcase the main character at the end it was also obvious that the thief was going to double cross them nobody had suspicions of him wasnt logical at all
Dec 22 2023,positive,it was a frankensteins moster of franchises mythologies and genres it was a spoof that took itself to seriously and yet entertaining i am not a fan of most of the stylistic choices made but i will be watching part two when it comes out
Dec 22 2023,negative,couldnt even make it to the end of part one
Dec 22 2023,negative,its as terrible as the reviews claim just one nonsensical action scene after another unlikable protagonist mixed with terrible writing i wont be surprised if part 2 is never released
Dec 22 2023,positive,very interesting movie not ground breaking but a great story that leaves you wanting more
Dec 22 2023,positive,great movie has everything the start of a space opera should have hoping that this story will run past 2 movies cannot wait for part 2
Dec 22 2023,negative,this movie has a ton of different science fiction tropes but none of the characters or worlds we see even get enough substance behind them to make the world building feel real
Dec 22 2023,positive,very beautiful movie the music photography and the action scenes were great i want to see more
Dec 22 2023,positive,plot pretty good it should of being done like a rated r 80s action movie to pack a punch they wasted a opportunity to set the trend
Dec 22 2023,negative,this movie looks nice but moves so slow and the dialogue is so boring  the action is ok but every fight has too many slow motion scenes
Dec 22 2023,positive,was it on par with dune no but it didnt need to be  its a fun popcorn scifi action movie went in with low expectations due to the critics score of 24 i actually enjoyed the movie enough that im interested in the sequel and the r rated extended cut
Dec 22 2023,positive,visually dazzling and very cool universe and setting  needed to be longer to give more character exposition but overall a good time
Dec 22 2023,positive,critics lowered my expectations however they were wrong the movie is entertaining
Dec 22 2023,positive,zack is great at world building and this movie is visually stunning and action packed creating a new universe that feels familiar but different at the same time is no easy challenge but yet cast and crew deliver an amazing first episode cant wait for part 2
Dec 22 2023,positive,great characters i wish we had more time with them the worlds explored were interesting and stunning cant wait to see more i like the direction of the story only one complaint some scenes couldve benefited more without a long duration of slow motion i would definitely recommend this to others
Dec 22 2023,negative,i really wanted to like this i love scifi and space operas inparticular but blah it could have subverted some expectations but instead gave viewers exactly what they thought was going to happen ive seen this story before and seen it better executed
Dec 22 2023,negative,the writing and lack of character development is just awful  you are watching a 2 hour video game  thats what these movies have become  zero substance with zero emotional ties to any characters
Dec 22 2023,positive,solid movie ok acting great action and great sequences star wars dorks probably think its a rip of that and hate accordingly regardless of what they think of another show set in space not called star wars this movie kicked ass
Dec 22 2023,positive,amazing movie cast and all cant wait for part 2
Dec 22 2023,positive,great movie  cant wait for part 2
Dec 22 2023,positive,while not perfect it was a really entertaining ride cant watch for part ii
Dec 22 2023,negative,the movie comes with bad lines bad acting and trash slowmo action theres more story telling than acting
Dec 22 2023,negative,it was pretty cringe just not good overall in every aspect
Dec 22 2023,positive,its a great movie visually emotionally a basic story but pretty epic
Dec 22 2023,positive,i want more cant wait for the r rated version need it now 
Dec 22 2023,positive,zack dont miss with high fiction cant wait for part two and directors cut
Dec 22 2023,positive,pretty decent scifi amazing visuals  less than fantastic dialogue felt very forced all in all solid effort would recommend
Dec 22 2023,negative,the movie is heavy on characters sharing long winded badly written exposition they dont show you who they are but they certainly tell you in depth with narrated flashbacks full of even more exposition its double exposition  this movie is clearly trying to be rogue one with worse acting worse dialogue a worse storyline its a failure on pretty much every level
Dec 22 2023,positive,cool background stories and exciting introductions to a team of rebels beautifully shot amazing battles and what seems to be a great start to a story that will conclude with a huge fight in part 2
Dec 22 2023,positive,highly imaginative but beyond the budget constraints you can see the amazing potential
Dec 22 2023,positive,a great start to a new world anxious to see more of what lies ahead acting action compelling story betrayal great heroes great villain all on point watch and simply enjoy
Dec 22 2023,positive,not sure what i watched the visuals where great and even all the alien characters looked great but i do believe i have seen a lot of similar designs from somewhere but cant put my finger on it the story was like a poorly written game it was so bad and there is nothing more i can say on the matter
Dec 22 2023,positive,why all the hate from critics this is such a great movie worthy of cinemas i know its a part 1 but it can stand on its own compelling story and great vfx i am looking forward for the battle of the rebels in part 2
Dec 22 2023,positive,fabulous the spider chick rocked
Dec 22 2023,positive,anyone whos gonna come in and autohate on this movie is an idiot was it like star wars sure if star wars was turned up to 11
Dec 22 2023,negative,every single aspect of this movie from top to bottom is halfbaked at best horrendously baffling at worst
Dec 22 2023,negative,the unexplainable abuse of slow mo makes it feel like a cheap tv movie visuals are otherwise great so it is a real pity if you are into fantasy science fiction you will enjoy it anyway
Dec 22 2023,negative,boring and full of tropes uninspired action scenes clumsy writing
Dec 22 2023,positive,just finished and im hooked been waiting for a film like this since dune just like any other movie its ups and downs and questionable moments but this is a franchise im truly behind and looking forward to and this first film man im hype the critics on the other hand wtf is wrong with all the hate what film did ya watch im confused
Dec 22 2023,positive,the critics are crazy   this is a very good movie
Dec 22 2023,negative,soooo much slow mo action  way over used as he does characters for the most part are uninteresting to me
Dec 22 2023,negative,snyders story telling continues to get worse with each movie  but now even his cinematography his use of out of focus lense for background objects is inconsistent and annoying at timesthis was a hard movie to get through acting story telling world building editing production its a mess
Dec 22 2023,negative,awful sets even worst writing and acting even the fight scenes are ultra bad
Dec 22 2023,neutral,the movie would be just an hour long if it wasnt that 45 of the movie is just ridiculous unnecessary slomo shots other than that movie is still pretty mid good time killer i guess
Dec 22 2023,negative,one word three times lazy lazy lazy its seven samurai meets star wars but with zero creativity or vision
Dec 22 2023,negative,thank you disney for keeping snyders hands off of the star wars franchise what a load of horse pucky made rise of skywalker look like hamlet
Dec 22 2023,negative,lets just string together cliche after cliche trope after trope its like they took cool scenes from every movie ever made then just jumbled it all together with some really epic slow motion action scenes  as a fan of the genre this will never be a dune or a starwars its just slightly better then jupiter ascending but definitely not as good as john carter
Dec 22 2023,negative,wow this movie is painful to watch  just bad pacing and poor direction  the script looks bad even though theres a fair amount of good set dressing and design
Dec 22 2023,positive,no idea why this movie gets all this hate its not perfect but 24 someone was owed a bj and didnt get it
Dec 22 2023,negative,i wish i had trusted the reviews time is valuable and i just wasted mine
Dec 22 2023,positive,nice movie  an interesting film and could be developed in a much bigger direction
Dec 22 2023,positive,an incredibly creative new universe with strong action and campbellian mythology great visual effects while this is a part one like dune or infinity war this story stands on its own im excited for whats to come
Dec 22 2023,negative,its a terribly disjointed version of seven samari just in space as has been done before with battle beyond the stars it looks pretty for the most part but the story pacing and characters are all lacking the movie gives you no reason to care about the characters or whats happening recommend you give this one a miss
Dec 21 2023,positive,epic movie and a visual and action filled buffet of art ray fisher and the rest of the cast were outstanding  rebelmoon
Dec 21 2023,negative,another example that zack synder is a phenomenal cinematographer but poor story teller
Dec 21 2023,negative,visual effects were great however the movie was nothing but a hodgepodge of other movies thrown up into a boring storyline i was hoping i would love it but it was such a let down
Dec 21 2023,negative,i was disappointed so much potential yet so many missed opportunities this is definitely not a good movie not the worst movie ever either but its certainly close
Dec 21 2023,negative,unfortunately the beautiful visual effects were not enough to make up for the utter lack of substance in the storytelling
Dec 21 2023,positive,i thought it held great production value the cinematography was beautifully shot   i was never board with the story in   fact i kept anticipating what was happening next  i cant wait for part 2
Dec 21 2023,negative,whilst synder dasels us with his visuals and commendable action sequences the story is entirely too long and suffers from pacing issues also some of the performances come as a little flat
Dec 20 2023,positive,i saw this tonight in london thanks for the free poster i really enjoyed it but it does heavily take influence from other scifi     this made me want to see the 3 hour cut even more i suspect thats probably the real film     its a bit light on action but it comes together nicely and i think the second part will be the better half
Dec 20 2023,negative,what a mess terrible pacing i dont know whats worse if this movie or the horrible star wars shows on disney
Dec 20 2023,positive,i absolutely loved this movie kai was definitely my favorite character cant wait for part 2
Dec 20 2023,negative,the score was proficient and at least one of the actors knew their lines
Dec 20 2023,positive,cant understand the low critics score here  way better than last few star wars films  characters a bit underdeveloped and can be a bit too overwhelming at times but really 100 solid
Dec 20 2023,positive,just saw this in london on a 70mm protection i got the very strong feeling the longer directors cut is going to be a much better film theres some beautiful sequences in this but its chopped to bits a mess all those gorgeous character stories of djimon hounsou and bae doona from the trailer just arent in it at all the characters suffer for it it doesnt make sense why they just didnt release the longer cut justice league and bvs all over again
Dec 20 2023,negative,is abominal visual effects are perfect but is abominal
Dec 20 2023,positive,i love all scifi and this is great
Dec 20 2023,positive,wait you dont have to verify your audience score no wonder theres thousands of ratings for a movie with limited release yikes
Dec 20 2023,positive,hotdamn scifi is the best
Dec 20 2023,positive,storyline had some familiarities however was a great movie in its own right
Dec 20 2023,positive,absolutely fantastic film
Dec 20 2023,positive,it is a very good movie
Dec 20 2023,positive,im not sure what movie the critics watched but the movie i watched is 
Dec 19 2023,positive,here goes again the unrealistic review of rotten tomatoes critics
Dec 19 2023,positive,meh  not goodd not terrible  meh
Dec 19 2023,positive,very violent and intense scifi film in the mold of blade runner outstanding lead performance by sofia boutella
Dec 19 2023,negative,trash dont waste your time
Dec 19 2023,positive,i dont know what these critics are even talking about they wouldnt know a good movie if it went across their face its an excellent film and i cant wait to see the second part of it
Dec 19 2023,positive,brilliant one of the greatest scifi epics ever made takes a lot from starwars and dune and every 90s fantasy and scifi and mixes it all together to create something that looks familiar but feels fresh cant wait for the next one
Dec 19 2023,positive,action style in this movie is awesome highly recommended
Dec 19 2023,positive,when star wars first aired back in the 70s it was panned by critics only to become one of the most loved movie franchises of all time     history repeats in rebel moon with artsy fartsy critic lining up on mass to show just how out of of touch they are with the audience     rebel moon part one is spectacular space fantasy that creates unique universe and sows the seeds of what can become a spectacular space fantasy series    the movie pays lashings of homage to fan fiction if you you are scifi geek you will enjoy this scifi franchise
Dec 19 2023,positive,fantastic movie dont no why so bad ranking
Dec 19 2023,positive,great movie to a new universe was it perfect depends who you ask i guess i enjoyed it and cant wait for more rt is unreliable at getting fair reviews clearly paid off
Dec 19 2023,positive,its not so bad in fact its a good entertainment
Dec 19 2023,positive,no where near as bad as the critics score makes you think just feels rushed and unfinished the 3 hour version will probably be a lot better
Dec 19 2023,negative,almost no story action was okay you will forget it as soon as you have finished watching it
Dec 19 2023,positive,please see this movie for yourself its shot well the action is good and i want to know what happens next of course with all zack snyders movies the visual story is stunning
Dec 19 2023,negative,lets say you gave the original star wars 9 out of 10 youd give movie 1 out of 10 ridiculous plot underdevoped characters and the sin repeated by every action movie in the last five years a 110 lb female model who can beat up every guy in cleveland
Dec 19 2023,negative,has some fun moments but bogged down by snyderisms
Dec 19 2023,positive,got to see this movie again absolute masterpiece loved it
Dec 19 2023,positive,visually stunning the world building is intense and fun i wish we learnt a bit more about each member of the crew though ed skrein stole the show for me an amazing villain with such a slime and evil presence its a must see for scifi fans into the aesthetic of warhammer and star wars
Dec 19 2023,negative,this movie is bad just bad
Dec 19 2023,positive,totally fun every thing you wouldshould want in a scifi crazy adventure the justice league was formed by the end of the first half without any of them having super powers good time
Dec 19 2023,positive,very good its what i was hoping for im looking forward to the next part
Dec 19 2023,negative,the reason why i didnt give it one star is because it was over two hours long also i have a cgi hangover and am confused why filmmakers think this would bail them out in place of a good story line i watched the whole thing im sure unlike many other people who probably didnt get through the whole two hours plus
Dec 19 2023,positive,awesome thats all cant wait for part two and the directors cuts
Dec 19 2023,positive,the music was top notch but the film only started strong for me the rest of it felt extremely choppy due to pacing issues and i feel only the directors cut can fix that id say watch it if youre interested    saw it at tiff
Dec 19 2023,neutral,the story felt ripped off this was obviously a rip kid star wars but no one hid that but the use of slow motion was obscene in this while it was visually beautiful it was boring and there was a lot of things that werent explained i gave this a shot bc i love charlie hunnam but this was just a no and the fact that they justify that they have a directors cut thats much better like dude you shouldnt need a directors cut to be your saving grace it was understandable for jl bc what happened but you had basically green flags to do whatever you wanted with this movie so thats very irritating people didnt like this movie and you think theyre gonna sit through a 5hour version
Dec 18 2023,positive,this was the best movie of 2023 cant wait for the second part the egyptian theatre was perfect for this movie and got packed with people this past friday  on my rating another master piece
Dec 18 2023,positive,love this movie amazing set characters costumes and actors lovely design story and cinematography
Dec 18 2023,positive,enjoyed the overall story the worlds are beautiful characters and costumes all looked great the action was average the camera was blurry at times not sure why the characters needed more screen time to reveal their motivations for joining kora but overall it was an enjoyable experience ill be waiting impatiently for part 2
Dec 18 2023,positive,a space opera made epic a world building so masive that you can espect anything froms this universe this part one is an exelent introdution that shurely will blow up with the second part and the directors cut
Dec 18 2023,negative,boring as hell prefer to watch star wars than this
Dec 18 2023,negative,i cant remember a movie with such a bad story line in it
Dec 18 2023,negative,plot was messy it felt out of order and nothing made sense
Dec 18 2023,positive,great movie great story and i cannot wait for the sequel
Dec 18 2023,negative,maybe it suffered from poor editing since the storyline jumped around too much making it difficult to follow    
Dec 18 2023,positive,i have seen all the movies of the year and this is by far the one i liked the most of all of them
Dec 18 2023,negative,the movie was a disappointment with a disjointed and sloppy plot that seemed like a random assortment of stolen scifi tropes    
Dec 18 2023,negative,promised much delivered almost nothing pretty visuals dont equal narrative
Dec 18 2023,positive,the movie is an absolute blast there is so much worldbuilding with a visual feast i am excited to see where this story leads
Dec 18 2023,positive,i was lucky to catch a preview screening i expected to see a copy of star wars but what i saw wasnt star wars it was much bigger the director created a living world from scratch we feel its enormity we meet a multitude of characters each of whom has their own story and role in this galaxy this is no longer the sterile and colorful scifi that disney gives us but a fullfledged cosmic dark fantasy a production that exceeds the expectations of modern audiences and gives something more  visually musically acted narratively in every respect rebel moon shines and i have no doubt that for many of you it will be the best production of this year if not the decade this film simply must be watched  maybe during the first viewing you will be a bit overwhelmed by the pace at which the story is presented but during the second viewing when you know what this production is about you will appreciate this film even more really watch this before someone will spoil you this masterpiece 
Dec 18 2023,negative,good special effects bad story
Dec 18 2023,negative,if you like to watch pretty pictures then this is the show for you if you like substance good story telling and emotional connections  watch something else this is yet another show that doesnt know how to write believable female characters as well i give it one star for the cgi and one star for the effort hard pass
Dec 18 2023,positive,so much fun to watch it was full of cool characters that i cant wait to watch in part 2
Dec 18 2023,positive,great epic movie love the action and drama characters have an arc and it has zero super hero weight everyone needed each other to fight the imperium theres love and hope and bad ass scenes where you feel like lord of the rings panoramic sequence with a scifi fantasy feel to it love the vast array of characters with lots of great dialogue
Dec 18 2023,negative,the visuals are amazing but the plot is not something new about gathering rebels fighting the empire betrayal greed etc and some have commented without being objective they have shown their hatred for a person gunn
Dec 18 2023,positive,amazing movie with amazing visuals and original ideas
Dec 18 2023,negative,abysmal disjointed and sloppy feels like a patchwork of stolen scifi tropes thrown together action sequences were lackluster this is nothing special the audience score will settle somewhere in the 60s when all is said and done
Dec 17 2023,positive,the film has amazing visual      excellent characters gorgeous stunt sequences    but storytelling is difficult to say it is the best we have to prepare for the directors cut
Dec 17 2023,positive,such a good movie you can always tell if its going to be good based off rt if they score it low it will probably be good too much hate for zac
Dec 17 2023,positive,zach snyders star wars coughs i mean rebel moon this is a good scifi film its got elements of genre blending elements of a viking norse epic a western seven samurai the magnificent seven and zacks version of star wars this isnt the same thing as star wars it has a different vibe it is a quality scifi film with a good mature story it has an epic score two times i could picture darth vader coming into the next scene based upon the audio design the visuals are great the story is great i took a road trip to the bay theater to see this in theaters and im glad i did i really liked it i want to see the r rated version it feels like some important elements of the story could be expanded upon there are hints that a sex scene may have been cut overall i like the tone the visual style and the audio design i wish it was available in a larger theater the small theater  screen didnt show it in the size and scale i would have preferred to see this needs to be shown on the larger screens to a mass audience this is a solid franchise starter its a quality movie i wish it was available in more theaters and on larger screens as it deserves this should have been a wider release i am glad i took the road trip to see it in theaters i can wait to see the full r rated version of the film
Dec 17 2023,positive,just saw it at tiff and man what a cliffhanger part 2 cant come soon enough
Dec 17 2023,negative,its a shame as i wanted synder to knock it out of the park but its a mess while the visuals are striking the story telling lacks much to be desired
Dec 17 2023,positive,zack never misses cant wait for part 2
Dec 17 2023,positive,very good excellent start to the franchise
Dec 17 2023,positive,just saw it at the paris theater in manhattan stunning visuals cant wait for part 2
Dec 17 2023,positive,to the rt crtcs your taste uck maybe because you have been tasting each others you need to get checked up start from pr0ct0logists looks like something is stuck up
Dec 17 2023,positive,this movie was everything i wanted it to be from the visuals to the performances and the score this film is a just a small drop of water in a vast ocean it leaves you wanting more of this fantastical new universe cant wait for the extended cut and its continuation in the spring
Dec 17 2023,positive,great visuals and a lot of heart the characters have depth the movie is over two hours but the movie is fast pace a must see for sci fi fans
Dec 17 2023,positive,if you like movies aside marvel disney and co you might like rm and its stunnig visuals
Dec 17 2023,negative,was really looking forward to this but it just fell a bit meh  maybe the second film will make it feel more complete
Dec 17 2023,negative,i fell sleep in the fist 30 min beeter go and watch star wars not a copy
Dec 17 2023,positive,what an epic and fun movie  beautiful shots fresh faces  unique universe  stunning fight scenes i had a blast watching it and cant wait for part 2 
Dec 17 2023,negative,i expected nothing but visuals and was somehow still disappointed
Dec 17 2023,positive,so fun epic and masterful it has all of snyders style and creativity and is just so enjoyable to experience  cant wait for part 2
Dec 17 2023,positive,rebel moon is a fun wild ride and an exceptional scifi fantasy movie i just wish this were the rrated version because i feel there is so much movie to be told i cant wait for part 2 to be released
Dec 17 2023,negative,so pretty and so dumb
Dec 17 2023,positive,great visual effects and a story that opens the door to an even bigger universe in fiction i definitely recommend it
Dec 17 2023,positive,greatest movie of all time must watch incredible mind blowing best of the best

Dec 17 2023,neutral,a visual masterpiece a narrative snoozefest
Dec 17 2023,negative,great visuals with writing that makes rise of skywalker look like the godfather
Dec 17 2023,positive,another masterpiece great cast great story cant wait for the sequel
Dec 17 2023,positive,was lucky enough to see it in theaters loved every minute of it bring on part 2
Dec 17 2023,negative,i adore sofia boutella and thats a good thing because she is in this movie and i honestly think she did as much as she could to save the movie but you cant do anything with no writing and no story and of course all the other stuff people have talked about being derivative etc i love you sofia but its a bad movie
Dec 17 2023,positive,what some people dont seem to understand is that this isnt one of the star wars moviesjust understand that its set in the armyversethe same universe as army of the dead and army of thieves that came out in 2021
Dec 17 2023,negative,girl boss movie again and again and again and again and again  
Dec 17 2023,negative,its as if the creative minds behind it decided to combine the artistic prowess of a snail with the audacity of a cardboard box yes my friend you heard me right the bar for originality was set so low that it could practically be used as a limbo stick by a toddler those characters oh boy they were about as memorable as a forgotten tweet in a sea of mundane social media posts i mean seriously they failed to leave even the faintest imprint on the viewers consciousness its astounding how something so lackluster managed to find its way onto the screen we deserve depth complexity and narratives that leave us in awe not just a shiny facade that crumbles upon closer inspection
Dec 17 2023,negative,makes the phantom menace look like a cinematic masterpiece
Dec 17 2023,positive,one of my favorites shoots all of time movie
Dec 17 2023,positive,visually stunning great story
Dec 17 2023,negative,hard to watch looked good but lacked any depth too much slow mo
Dec 16 2023,positive,i was dragged to this movie by my friends to watch in 70mm  i came out in love with this new world they built in this movie epic visuals  really fast pace but overall epic movie
Dec 16 2023,positive,what a masterpiece visually stunning actionpacked and keeps you on the edge of your seat     this is star wars on steroids    id give this 810 and put it in the top 5 of best movies of 2023
Dec 16 2023,positive,flawless movie 
Dec 16 2023,negative,this is just objectively bad   the tired slomo actions notwithstanding the highly derivative plot drags and the characters are mostly shallow underdeveloped archetypes youd more expect from a bored teenager in class rather than an experienced filmmaker theres a reason why this never became part of the star wars franchise and this is the same reason you should give rebel moon a hard pass
Dec 16 2023,positive,the critics reviews stink fishy   in any case critics reviews have never been as significant as audience reviews
Dec 16 2023,positive,it is a whole new universe very magical and cinematic with lots of homages to classics cant wait for the extended r version but this was so enjoyable and a great setup for part 2 watch it
Dec 16 2023,positive,this movie is epic big scale  bug character lore awesome world building out of the world vfx and cinematography  cant wait for part 2
Dec 16 2023,positive,movie was visually stunning actionpacked great acting score etc only thing was that i had some favorite characters in here that didnt have enough screentime in this 2hr cut definitely need that extra hour of the directors cut thats to flesh out their narratives too so cant wait for that
Dec 16 2023,positive,watched this movie with my friends at 70mm screening without any knowledge of what it is about and this movie surprised me  the visuals the character lore score all top notch it was really fast paced but i found out they will release longer r rated version soon    definitely recommend this movie to everyone who wants to watch big scale space opera with mindblowing visuals and new story
Dec 16 2023,positive,this movie was excellent
Dec 16 2023,positive,such a great movie cant wait for the directors cut 
Dec 16 2023,positive,this is pure cinema   i encourage people to see it in theaters if and when they can
Dec 16 2023,positive,couldnt ask more for a new starting space opera  loved it beautiful visual great story probably too complex for some people but dont let that fool you
Dec 16 2023,positive,this movie was amazing i cant wait for the rrated version you can definitely tell more of the storys world building arc was left on the cutting room floor but i cant wait to enjoy more of this world sofia boutella is an action movie star
Dec 16 2023,positive,this movie is beautiful story is solid but lack character arc or development but that will be fixed in longer cut that has 1 hour of extra footage    sofia really shined as lead all characters look important for the story and contribute to the plot minor pacing issues will be fixed in the longer cut later  overall really impressed with this movie even though i have watched star wars but this looked fresh and different i cant wait for longer r rated directors cut and not to forget part 2
Dec 16 2023,positive,epic cant wait for part 2  bring it on
Dec 16 2023,positive,a fantastic  movie  epic scale and mythology  a movie which is not necessarily made for critics to enjoy but for us the fans who appreciate the work and effort done   zack is an amazing director and amazing person and his work is really enjoyable and appreciated by his fans who value his unique art 
Dec 16 2023,positive,the first part of rebel moon is great  it can still be improved i have faith that zack will give us more movies like this he doesnt deserve that bad score that the supposed film critics gave him
Dec 16 2023,positive,its nice its good its can be more good
Dec 16 2023,negative,perhaps it was badly edited it jumped around so much and i didnt care about the characters cant knock the ambition though
Dec 16 2023,positive,one of the better movies of the year great story and visuals need to see the second one asap
Dec 16 2023,positive,if we are talking of cinema   this is it  pure in its perfection
Dec 16 2023,positive,no one has watched this movie yet dont believe this score
Dec 16 2023,positive,i really enjoyed it yes it was a very very fastpaced story but it was very enjoyable sound effects were awesome and the cast was great   the visuals and action was superb as usual   thank you zack
Dec 16 2023,negative,meh visually stunning but otherwise there really wasnt anything special about this it didnt click with me emotionally at all sucks that the ratings are gonna be full of hardcore synder fanboys trying to make a point by spamming good reviews and people that are gonna review bomb it because they dont like the guy its a shame usually zack synder hits it out of the park with epics that have a large cast like his cut of justice league 300 and watchmen better than army of the dead though and maybe part 2 will save it
Dec 16 2023,positive,wowthis is such a epic movie visually a masterpiececant wait for part 2 
Dec 16 2023,positive,it was worth the wait  snyder as always bringing visually stunning films
Dec 16 2023,positive,loved this movie visual stunning great movie love the mythology action and science fiction marvel waiting for more with anticipation
Dec 16 2023,positive,an epic sci fi universe in the making is off to a strong start with the part 1 of rebel moon while i cant wait for the directors cut it was an absolute delight and an incredible watch highly recommend this for anyone that loves the sci fi western diesel punk esque genre
Dec 16 2023,negative,a terrible movie with a notable lack of character development and boring moments
Dec 16 2023,positive,absolute cinema had a great time with it
Dec 16 2023,negative,derivative as it is beautiful rebel moon is an amalgamation of the worst tropes in scifi this would have fared better if it didnt so desperately want to be a launching pad for the best new scifi ip one of snyders worst
Dec 16 2023,positive,it is an epic space epic from one of the filmmakers who best shoots action scenes in the history of cinema  highly recommended
Dec 16 2023,negative,please stop zack just stop 
Dec 16 2023,positive,absolutely loved it    i loved the characters and tone its really sincere and got me thoroughly engaged    cant wait to see the longer cut too then part two
Dec 16 2023,positive,good movie see it for yourself
Dec 16 2023,negative,ive never made an rotten tomatoes account but this movie is so painfully bad i had to all the zach fan boys love this because flashy lights with a bad filter over it will get dumb people to give 5 starts to anything please for the love of god stop letting zach into the studio
Dec 16 2023,positive,a visual spectacle as expected that manages to combine its influences kurosawa   lucas primarily into a stew that feels old but tastes new very curious to see where it goes shouldve just released the full version though as it leaves you wanting more and not just in the ways that it should
Dec 16 2023,positive,its amazing 910   the music the visuals everything is just amazing critics got it all wrong
Dec 16 2023,negative,most of the critics are spot on  so unbelievably boring it feels like a two hour trailer just a collection of different scenes that dont flow from one to the next without a single interesting character or story beat in sight  the star wars references are a little too on the nose but that would be fine if you even cared 10 about the characters or the world    the main villain was pretty decent though the only time i was somewhat interested is when he was on screen
Dec 16 2023,positive,not really a fan of scifi but this was actually alot of fun my favourite character would have to be admiral atticus noble the villian ed skrein plays him so well you start to hate him lol i heard there will be r rated directors cut so really looking forward to those too
Dec 16 2023,positive,twitter gonna say it aint good lol fake movie fans dont know anything lol this movie is great
Dec 16 2023,positive,another awesome movie everyone should watch wowww visuals waiting for part 2 the the scargiver
Dec 16 2023,positive,seven samurai in space zack never disappoint actiongreat cinematographygreat story wisegood pacinggreat
Dec 16 2023,positive,it was fun intense and emotional its a fantastic way to spend a couple of hours and get lost in the lore and story idk what those critics are seeing but this is a good movie
Dec 16 2023,negative,i really dont understand why you wouldnt just put out the directors cut as the first option to watch the movie i doubt it would solve all the problems with the movie but it would at least flesh out the story and characters a little more
Dec 16 2023,positive,its an amazing act clean visual and gc deep character and plot looking forward for part 2
Dec 16 2023,positive,this movie is visually stunning as is most of his work the acting superb  all in all best movie of the year the critics on here have been paid by wbd to bomb this movie which you will see once you watch the movie for yourself 5 stars

Dec 16 2023,positive,everything about this movie was great i cant wait for part two
Dec 16 2023,positive,the best science film of the last 20 years i havent seen anything like it
Dec 16 2023,positive,yet another example of why critics opinions dont matter and they never have the movie looks and sounds amazing a true work of art yet again from synder if this was a one and done then i would be furious with how this movies ends it left me wanting more and in april we get more synder has created something original and its truly epic dont listen to critics judge for yourself they self proclaimed importance should never effect who watches or enjoys a movie
Dec 16 2023,positive,criticisms are valid felt like the dialogue was a little clunky and exposition heavy at times but memorable story great action and beautiful visuals looking forward to the directors cut and part two
Dec 16 2023,positive,i was worried it wasnt gonna feel original but i love the world building cant wait for part 2
Dec 16 2023,positive,for me its a masterpiece im also a star wars fan but rebel moon is simply beautiful and a visual delight unfortunately as always there are haters who try to change the mood but in the end only the streaming numbers count and they will be very high im looking forward to part 2 give 10 out of 10 points
Dec 16 2023,negative,i wanted this to be the next big thing unfortunately it fails on every level zack needs to take a time out and stop pandering to his audience hes got the potential to be great
Dec 16 2023,negative,if this is zacks attempt to create a star wars copy well he failed woefully rebel moon has once again shown and prove every problem with zacks films the plot the plot is the key and zack with his years of experience still hasnt figured that out yet well his casual fans are gonna love it at least
Dec 16 2023,positive,good cast beautiful visuals an enjoyable movie
Dec 16 2023,positive,amazing movie  cant believe all the negative reviews  now people cant even watch a movie based on a review because of review bombing and biasness 
Dec 16 2023,positive,great movie  zs did his thing here  we know the professional critics are bought and paid for  you should watch this movie if you are into syfy type stuff for sure
Dec 16 2023,positive,an absolute gem zack as always took the risk and establish a sci fi universe worth investing in and something to be celebrated by all sci fi lovers out there
Dec 16 2023,positive,wow thats really an interesting movie and universe
Dec 16 2023,positive,was waiting for this movie
Dec 16 2023,positive,amazing from start to finish fresh new take on scifi themes followed by zacks amazing visuals and slo mos lot of lore to get into and discover a must see
Dec 16 2023,positive,rebel moon is unique and exquisite from the stars and beyond is flawless in every characteristic of storytelling part one is a dose of excitement adventure and emotions remarkable visual perfection a heavenly inspiration of imagination
Dec 16 2023,positive,the best star wars movie that was never maid
Dec 16 2023,positive,had the privilege to attend the screening of this film aint a big fan of zacks work especially army of the dead and bvs but rebel moonholy moly reminded me of 300 although theres some parts that definitely feel like they were cut for the runtime the story is really profound with lovable characters go for it
Dec 16 2023,negative,the worst copy that ive ever seen of star wars
Dec 16 2023,positive,this is exactly how you make movies  everything is executed so well even if its not the rrated directors cut acting scores cinematography this is top tier filmmaking this is how great movie looks like  cant wait to see part 2 and both of the rrated directors cut
Dec 16 2023,positive,is a great movie a new universe is starting
Dec 16 2023,negative,literally one of the most boring movies ive seen it has extremely confusing plots stories scenes and strange character settings there is almost nothing outstanding about this movie except for the vfx
Dec 16 2023,positive,its an epic space adventure with a captivating storyline the characters are welldeveloped and the visuals are truly out of this world its a mustwatch
Dec 16 2023,positive,the emotions the threat of the oppressive government the price of freedom this movie is so truthful the message is so clear besides that the directors really knew how to create a world building and execute the film thanks for anyone involved in the making of this film this film is diamond
Dec 16 2023,negative,i saw it and low key mid i thought this was going to be good very disappointing
Dec 16 2023,positive,this is the kind of movie we need this is when the director given the freedom to express and spread the message for the world it has clear messages for all of us the acting is absolutely incredible the score is grandeur the story is just the tip of the iceberg but it delivers so much lore already amazing
Dec 16 2023,negative,totally garbage lack of heart and humar unnecessary slowmos very bad story telling there are to many plot wholes only stunning visuals dont make a movie good enough
Dec 16 2023,positive,amazing amd rollercoaster scifi with great cgi and part 1 build with action sequences and the slowmo is crispy 
Dec 16 2023,positive,this is something i will call a perfect christmas movie
Dec 16 2023,positive,great visuals score and a good start to an expanding universe
Dec 16 2023,positive,i seen this at the london bfi imax at the premiere i largely enjoyed this movie it was filled with great action scenes diverse characters great world building and when you peel away the skin there is a huge universe to dissect in terms of themes and mythology    there are going to be two cuts of this movie one is a more family oriented movie and the longer cut in zacks words is crazy and brutal but even the family friendly version has several mature themes in it than the run of the mill marvel movie for example it respects what it is and doesnt hold back    the performances by every actor is top notch the visuals and music is amazing and the set pieces are wonderful    ive rated this

Dec 16 2023,negative,woof absolute garbage and mess of a film kora is a terrible actress half the movie is shot in slow motion the finale is dull the twist fell flat and predictable seriously you allow a whole cantina to hear you want to go against the imperials and immediately trust the first person to tell you they have a ship fucking stupid and you take out a whole platoon of guys meant to keep your village in line do they not ever need to check in no one is getting updates from them also who the fuck cares about the slain kings daughter that background story really went nowhere fast

Dec 15 2023,positive,despite only focusing on a couple main characters and leaving the others in the background rebel moon succeeds in action works building design and creativity with the announcement of the 3 hour directors cut coming next year its safe to bet the pacing issues and characters will be more fleshed out as it is its an entertaining first entry into a fantastic fantasy world

Dec 15 2023,positive,great action  great characters
Dec 15 2023,positive,rebel moon a story that tells a tale of a former soldier known as kora that ran off from tyrannical empire to live peacefully at a small moon called veldt until admiral atticus noble lands on the planet and the quest to find rebels that willing to join them to save the whole universe    what do i think of rebel moon      the film itself ranging from visuals spectacle to its world building it was phenomenal zack knows what hes doing from the ground up personally for me its already ten times better than star wars content for the past 20 years this should be watch on the biggest screen and on imax for sure how good the visuals is and for the story and characters all set well and done every character is a definite show stealer especially kora and kai both of them are badassess the side characters also did and serve their purpose to the story while i have small gripes i would say that the story should be more fleshed out and they could just add up around 20 minutes more to the film so that it can breathe and seen more characters clild shine throughout     all and all rebel moon is by far one of the best action films in 2023 dont forget to check it out
