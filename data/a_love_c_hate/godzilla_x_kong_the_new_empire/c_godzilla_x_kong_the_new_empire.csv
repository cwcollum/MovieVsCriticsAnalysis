Apr 12 2024,neutral, as if godzilla and kong werent enough director adam wingard unleashes a host of others in godzilla x kong the new empire and lets the skyscrapers fall where they may kong you may remember is dwelling in hollow earth godzilla is napping at the colosseum as long as theyre in separate corners everything is ok godzilla however gets up from his nap stomps around europe making even more ruins in italy and france and senses theres a kongfrontation just waiting to happen kong meanwhile has an infected tooth and needs help we know this because dr ilene andrews rebecca hall has a daughter kaylee hottle who can communicate with him via sign language to set things straight andrews assembles a crew including a conspiracy theorist and a gonzo veterinarian and zips to hollow earth sure enough kong has a bad bite and another set of monster adversaries when a battle hurts his arm the vet played by dan stevens cooks up a kongsized infinity gauntlet glove trademark pending and gets the big ape moving all sorts of creatures prehistoric and otherwise start checking in the goal is to settle them and get to godzilla but who first and when all of the creatures including one youve heard plenty about but didnt realize was so literal cause trouble sending all parts of the world into turmoil after they do their urgent care bit the humans are fairly expendable still they stick around to see what happens and give the girl plenty to translate while godzilla makes his way to kong we start calculating the insurance loss in addition to ruining ruins in europe he levels pyramids in egypt kong isnt as destructive he just hangs from buildings but he does have some nasty adversaries if its wingards goal to spin them off into other features were in trouble there are so many villains in godzilla x kong its impossible for anyone to divide and conquer interestingly the effects in this film arent as good as the ones in the lowbudget godzilla minus one the monsters look a bit halting when in doubt wingard and company turn up the light movie critic bruce miller says snack shack is profane constantly in motion and very retro its the vacation you didnt think you needed but sure were glad you took
Apr 12 2024,negative, i cant say ive ever had to review a film and i didnt know how to pronounce its title im of course talking about the sequel to 2021s godzilla vs kong which is confusingly titled godzilla x kong the new empire  are we saying godzilla ex kong godzilla times kong godzilla and kong just godzilla kong or are we just awkwardly trying to avoid saying the name of the film vaguely speaking of the new godzilla film and waiting for someone else to make a mistake with the title  thankfully the film itself is much more straightforward than its title adam wingard has returned to helm the sequel to his box office success godzilla vs kong which saw the titular monsters make peace with each other and team up against an unlikely threat at the end  we return to hollow earth  thats the subterranean ecosystem thats underneath our surface  where kong rules however a new threat rises from an even deeper level of the earths core and this time kong isnt strong enough to defeat it on his own  enter godzilla whos been peacefully snoozing in the ruins of the colosseum and who only awakens to fight more titans as they threaten humanity can kong and godzilla put their differences aside once more to defeat this new threat  without giving anything away godzilla x kong the new empire would make a strangely good doublebill with ghostbusters frozen empire both being about empires and icy threats  mileage will inevitably vary when it comes to godzilla x kong your opinion on the film probably depends on what youre expecting from a film about two ginormous cgi creatures wreaking havoc while puny humans run around like headless chickens delivering exposition where needed  once again the humans are the weakest part of the film theres admirable effort from writers terry rossio simon barrett and jeremy slater to improve the mandatory human subplots by having jia the last member of the iwi tribe and irene andrews adopted daughter question her place in the world but lets be real were not paying to watch the humans grapple with their identities or family ties we pay to watch kong and godzilla wreak havoc  there is some mayhem in godzilla x kong but not nearly enough the very beginning in which kong is established as an unstoppable force and the true king of hollow earth suggests that we may be in for a satisfyingly gloopy gooey film in which many a monster is ripped in half this promise is never fulfilled godzilla x kong disappointingly proves to be a onetrick pony albeit a very big pony  if the film was released a year ago i may have enjoyed it a whole lot more the final nail in godzilla x kongs coffin is the fact that weve had an incredible godzilla film just a few months ago godzilla minus one proved that you can make a great kaiju movie with a balanced human element and great not to mention oscarwinning visual effects if anything godzilla x kong seems to lean more heavily towards the emotive kong and perhaps it would have worked better as a sequel to kong skull island  its not all bad though the cgi is surprisingly good and dan stevens playing the worlds weirdest vet and occasional ape dentist is having the time of his life brian tyree henry reprising his role as conspiracy theorist bernie hayes also adds a lot of levity in a film that seems to think its funnier than it really is with godzilla x kong wingard is aiming for a lighter more entertaining film than its predecessor but the film is ultimately brought down by cringey dialogue and unnecessary human baggage  warner bros is said to be examining its 2024 slate  which includes beetlejuice 2  and considering delays as the actors strike continues   a ray of hope appeared yesterday that perhaps the actors strike might be coming to an end sooner rather than later after a contentious couple of weeks in which negotiations broke down   david zaslav wont be deleting films at paramount pictures as well as warner bros after all it seems it seems increasingly likely that paramount pictures will have a new owner within the next year or two chairperson shari redstone who effectively decides the companys fate is all but certain to be selling her interests but whos   mission impossible star tom cruise joins forces with warner bros in a partnership that will see him develop big budget films for the studio tom cruise already has projects underway with paramount and universal but you can now add warner bros to the list of studios that have cemented a working relationship with the top  warner bros has released the first trailer for the penguin the batman spinoff

Apr 12 2024,positive,this is a massive saturday morning cartoon featuring big monster battles exciting teamups and plenty of epic moments that being said the plot lacks cohesion and most of the main human subplot is messy 
Apr 11 2024,positive, on this episode kevin lee from awardswatch joins jd and brendan to discuss the latest in the monsterverse franchise with godzilla x kong the new empire all of these films are varying forms of diverting thrill while being narratively very messy and this one doesnt do much to sway away from that formula however we do have a lot of fun talking about what makes it different even if much of it is the same
Apr 11 2024,positive,while the story hides the crux of the plot for more than half the story theres still enough carnage to maintain excitement even if we dont know the point
Apr 10 2024,negative, last time we encountered king kong and godzilla or hollywoods lesser version of him anyway in the selfexplanatory godzilla vs kong they ended up putting aside their differences to defeat mechagodzilla in a brawl that laid waste to half of hong kong in godzilla x kong the new empire  which somehow skips over godzilla 4 kong the honeymoon years  their relationship has evolved into a precarious détente the great ape has made a home for himself monkeying around in hollow earth the mythical fantasy world beneath the planets crust while the radioactive reptile remains on the surface helping ward off beastly threats to an otherwise ungrateful humanity to be fair he is accidentally stomping their major tourist destinations as always poor godzilla is just misunderstood when he curls up like a kitten for a nap in the colosseum after a hard days fight he has our hearts in his clammy little claws the same cant be said for the movies returning human characters who are once again tasked with delivering thankless exposition and feeble stabs at comedy rebecca hall is back sporting a chic new do and grim new expression as kong expert dr ilene andrews as is kaylee hottle as the doctors adopted daughter jia a hearingimpaired skull island native with a psychic connection to the big gorilla also collecting another pay cheque is brian tyree henry whos saddled with the movies most impossible task making a podcaster funny responding to a distress signal from deep within hollow earth the team are joined by dan stevenss trapper a monster vet in a douchey hawaiian shirt who the movie introduces like hes the second coming of snake plissken back beneath the earths crust kong clashes with a hostile army of apes led by the villainous skar king an aggrieved simian with questionable grooming habits a whip made of dinosaur bones and an ancient vendetta against godzilla he also keeps a pet radioactive kaiju  thatd be shimu if youre playing titan bingo  chained up and ready to rumble kong wont be alone for long godzilla has soon picked up the scent of a skirmish and the intrepid humans discover an ancient civilisation of oldtimey tribal tropes  led by fala chens iwi queen  who worship the series most iconic diva mothra alas nobody shouts mothra is mothering which seems like a missed opportunity godzilla vs kong was something of a surprise smash during a respite from lockdown in 2021 when the prospect of seeing epic monsters square off on the big screen seemed like the perfect balm after months of house arrest but the sequel arrives after years of the usual mirthless hollywood spectacles which promise mindless fun but lack the imagination to fire up the senses it doesnt help that the great oscarwinning godzilla minus one while obviously very different in tone is so fresh in our memories directed like its predecessor by american genre filmmaker adam wingard youre next the guest godzilla x kong is a blur of noise and colour that does have its moments of charm kongs grunting and growling smackdown with the skar king set against a smouldering subterranean landscape feels like a wrestling match waged between ancient gods and his table manners or lack thereof  snacking on a serpents neck as though it were a sushi roll  continue to be a nice running gag as in the previous movie the netherworld of hollow earth casts a shimmering multicoloured spell giving the impression of being trapped inside a magic crystal or a stoners panel van circa 1977 less impressive is wingards reliance on an aesthetic schtick that felt played out five years ago oodles of lazy neon a synth score and the sort of fm radio needle drops that even the guardians of the galaxy or thor might think twice about using nobody needs to be exposed to kiss in 2024 godzilla x kong shouts fun  splashes it across the screen with every tool in its digital paintbox still for a movie that features kong and godzilla going up against a superape riding a radioactive dinosaur its surprisingly dull devoid of much in the way of wonder soul or the genuinely strange by the time the monster tag teams are soaring toward each other in embarrassing slow motion even two giants of the cinema have been reduced to something as common  as lacking in invention  as marvel superhero spectacle with all respect to the talented visual effects team who are only operating according to their brief i spent most of the movie wondering how easy it may soon be to recreate all this generic commotion in open ai generative video with a few text prompts and a general knowledge of monster lore at what point will it merely be easier and cheaper for studios to farm out this kind of product to anonymous ai servers  or even let audiences create their own versions when bigscreen spectacle becomes lacklustre can viewers be blamed for not knowing the difference between ai and the real deal godzilla x kong isnt exactly the death knell of the blockbuster  and its unfair to ask that a simple story of friendship between a nuclear lizard and a 50foot ape bear the brunt of cinemas woes but it might be a sign that hollywood needs to watch out lest it become the next

Apr 10 2024,negative, godzilla x kong the new empire is the fifth film in warner bros monsterverse the inexplicably popular franchise involving cinemas two biggest beasts this latest episode has already been a hit but like its predecessors its mostly forgettable  returning to hollow earth the underground dimension from the last film kong and godzilla must team up to stop a new tribe of giant apes and a titan from wreaking havoc on the surface world  thats about as much plot as the script allows spending the first act shovelling exposition until they are allowed to give the screen over to a colourful monster mash the action is entertaining and the effects are impressive but thats all the film has to offer the beleaguered human cast are wasted looking up at their cgi castmates with rebecca halls titan expert explaining every step while a returning brian tyree henry cracks jokes along with newbie dan stevens  in some ways would be ridiculous to expect anything more the american takes on godzilla have always traded on action over subtext and previous film godzilla vs kong was a crowd pleaser that overcame a shallow plot with huge beasts tearing it up in a neon city theres nothing wrong with mindless spectacle but after five movies its beginning to repeat itself director adam wingard who broke through with 2014 thriller the guest delivers a trailer friendly product that makes a lot of noise but leaves no impression  it doesnt help that godzilla x kong arrives just a few months after godzilla minus one the latest japanese godzilla that reminded audiences of just how powerful these movies can be by comparison these low iq american cousins offer little more than hollywood spectacle 
Apr 10 2024,negative, there will be many comparisons in the next day or three between godzilla minus one takashi yamazakis shockingly beautiful and elegiac epic about a giant lizard triggering nationwide trauma for a country in ruins and godzilla x kong the new empire the newest monster smash up between the big g and the ape from skull island but right at the top every reader should recognize this is a fruitless exercise a contrast as meaningful as pondering the differences between a genuine oscar winner and a saturday morning cartoon for make no mistake godzilla x kong is a cartoon im told the film technically qualifies as live action too because rebecca hall brian tyree henry and dan stevens appear in front of some blue screens and presumably to pick up hefty paychecks for their troubles but i still dont entirely believe it flesh and blood actors might float by to spout exposition but the space they occupy is as real as bob hoskins foray into toontown and a fraction as interesting of course the cartoon label could apply to almost every monsterverse film weve had to date yet the new empire holds the unenviable distinction of being the first where for large swaths of the running time the monsters are as dull as the humans they step over chief among those timefilling ants is rebecca halls dr irene andrews who returns from 2021s equally dumb but much more kinetic godzilla vs kong if you dont recall she is the kong expert who has also become the adoptive mother of jia kaylee hottle the tween girl who is the lone survivor of the iwi tribe from the now desolated skull island and because jia is starting to have nightmarish visions our doublecredentialed and world renowned monarch scientist is turning for help to a conspiracy theory podcaster yeah even the movie doesnt really know how to explain it but it at least gets brian tyree henry back for another goround which is never a bad thing together irene and henrys bernie convince monarch to send a team of scientists down into the hollow earth where kong lives as king alas though its a lonely rule since his only friends wear lab coats the heroes also take along a veterinarian dan stevens so the proper banter quota can be met yet as they look down there for answers to jias visionsand around the same time that kong discovers a new race of giant apes living beneath the surface of the earthgodzilla is forced to shoehorn his sizable frame into the movie by causing a ruckus topside first he inexplicably starts curling up like a kitten inside the roman colosseum and then he wakes up cranky and in need of a nuclear power plant pickmeup it seems the big g also senses something bad is coming and wants to get juiced for the rumble the monsterverse movies have always been a mixed bag while the aforementioned saturday morning cartoon aesthetic has frequently tickled this reviewers nostalgia buttons it is impossible to ignore the intentional simplicity to use a diplomatic term in movies like kong skull island or godzilla king of the monsters when director adam wingard took over the reins in 2021s godzilla vs kong he removed all pretense the human characters scenes were cut to the bone and relied on stereotypes of stereotypes but the monsters they rarely appeared giddier with wingard replicating the crashyouractionfigurestogether glee of late shōwa era kaiju movies from the toho studios of the 1970sonly with a 21st century hollywood budget watching godzilla and king kong throw fisticuffs at each other about every 30 minutes was a 12yearolds dream but now with the flair of a visual stylist who bathed the spectacle in chic neon pinks or yellows and clean shots that took advantage of zero gravity environments in the hollow earth godzilla x kong the new empire attempts to replicate all those flourishes and tricks right down to godzilla even providing the hot neon pink in rustic settings like the pyramids of giza his fins get a barbieland glow up the problem however is that we have to wait a long time for that godzilla and kong action despite the film being a fleet 115 minutes godzilla x kong drags where godzilla vs kong skipped into its happy haymakers the earlier film was a glorified fight night spectacle which saw the title characters get into a donnybrook at least once per act by contrast godzilla x kong keeps them apart and instead focuses far too much on limp comedy beats delivered by actors working from the worst script in the monsterverse saga which is saying something and kong also befriending a proverbial son of kong as he battles another giant ape called the scar king while we appreciate the allusions to both the mostly forgotten merian c cooper 1933 quickie sequel to king kong as well as tohos own son of godzilla 1967 the tsunamis worth of cgi in godzilla x kong lacks the charm of willis obriens 1930s stopmotion or the goofiness of a kid in a rubber suit when used right digital effects can awe and overwhelm but they rarely ever endear or beguile and all the money spent on godzilla x kongs hollow earth giant apes sequences prove as inert and lifeless as the drama between hall and stevens doing their damndest with nothing one of the only thrilling sequences in godzilla x kong is the row by the nile where godzilla kong and a mysterious third party we cannot spoil get in a tussle with the great pyramid of khufu as their squared circle its daffy devastating to world history and a return to the jejune appeal of godzilla vs kong and many toho classics it is also literally godzilla vs kong redux similarly there is then an immediate followup final battle royale at the center of the earth with more creatures duking it out than a super smash bros online free for all after 90 minutes of being lulled into a stupor the climax makes for an extremely expensive alarm buzzer for those looking purely for that monster mash high this overcaffeinated climax might scratch an itch but when you need just as much caffeine to stay awake up until that point it feels like the fight is already lost whether its godzilla kong the scar king or mystery monster x there are no winners hereand certainly not in the audience
Apr 9 2024,negative,the script there is a plot but its preposterous tosh and it makes no sense and it doesnt even try to make sense stuff stuff stuff roar 
Apr 9 2024,positive, in honor of godzilla x kong the new empire the two titans of riotus are teaming together like the big fellas at the center of the movie for a jointreview of the new monsterverse entry julian lytle after a banner 70th anniversary year for the king of monsters godzilla with the apple tv series monarch and then the academy awardwinning godzilla minus one its a great time to be into godzilla were also at the tenyear mark for the legendary monsterverse films with adam wingard returning after the successful godzilla vs kong we now have them in a teamup movie i guess the most surprising thing about going to see godzilla x kong the new empire is did you really expect the monsterverse to make it this far and do you feel like this is a good entry into this franchise william goodman its kind of funny to me that the dceu and the monsterverse launched within a year of one another yet the latter is a far more successful and coherent extended universe sometimes it pays to keep it simple this new installment is a good entry into the kaiju genre mostly because wingard has a good sense of what people want to see giant monsters fighting one another thats not to say there arent things to quibble about in terms of pacing or structure but godzilla minus one and these monsterverse films are not i think its wonderful that this film can exist alongside that one and that you can have a bit of a choice of your own adventure when it comes to tales of the king of the monsters should we explain the plot of this one a little bit jl so after the events of godzilla vs kong we have a split in how the territory of the world is split up by the two godzilla runs the surface or else and kong is now exploring the hollow earth set up in the last film as he tries to look for other giant apes something is causing trouble leading to more titan attacks that godzilla must deal with as well as some weird readings monarch is noticing along with jia kaylee hottle the iwe tribe girl who was introduced in the last movie as kongs friend her adopted mother dr ilene andrews rebecca hall and monarch scientist in charge of kong decided to go down to hollow earth bringing back titan conspiracy theorist podcaster bernie hayes brian tyree henry from the last movie as well this leads to three different journeys to dealing with a new secret threat from the past of the planet the titans and godzillas place in all of it for me all of this was pretty easy to follow but i do know that for many the plot lines about the human characters are a drag do you feel that the plot of jia and ilene and in turn all of monarch hurts or helps the film wg i do think the weakest portion of the monsterverse movies are the human characters wingard hit on something in the last film though rebecca hall i think hall is one of our most underappreciated performers and she always brings believability to reach role she takes while also elevating the material accordingly shes saddled with whole scenes that are nothing but expository dialogue and makes them feel effortless while also selling the paternal relationship with jia  the human element gets a boost this time around though thanks to trapper dan stevens reuniting with wingard from the guest a walltowall banger stevens is having an absolute blast here playing  and i shit you not  kongs veterinarian hes introduced by flying in on a giant orbital platform to yank a rotten tooth from the ape  while i still think the human characters often feel like set dressing or a secondary thought wingard is doing his best to provide them with as much engaging material as possible it also helps that stevens hall henry and hottle are the only human leads streamlining the cast down from the last film does give these plots a bit more weight that other monsterverse films havent quite had  while it is all easy to follow it is all a little nonsensical at times i did feel the setup to get kong and godzilla was a little more forced this time around what about you how do you feel the big guns fare this time jl while im a big supporter of the human parts of these movies because of my lifelong fandom of godzilla films and seeing them all multiple times its how they handle the titans which while i enjoy is showing cracks in the monsterverse overall narrative these folks want to make another kong movie but kong or as he continues in this film from the last  kong mcclane will never be as big of a draw as godzilla kong has the heroic journey and arc and for most of it you can see the influence of the modern planet of the apes film on this version of kong his life in the hollow earth is explored from his making of traps to deal with threats his daily life of taking showers and even having to go to the dentist  kongs journey with jias story as a companion piece to push along the story is a lot of fun to watch yet then we get to godzilla whos used like how batman and wolverine were in the 90s crossover superhero comics hes seasoning at best godzilla knows everything and he knows whats going on even as others dont and it doesnt change how he operates in the world his little segments are more or less getting his power up to destroy the final threat that actually to godzilla isnt a threat at all its tuesday a lateday meeting at work its just an annoyance yet godzilla looked amazing in this movie after the film we chatted briefly about the effects and animation of this movie and just how consistent they are with this franchise what stood out to you on how it looks cinematically wg wingards style is pretty dynamic by nature so the camera is fluid with its movements our screening was in imax and the film definitely takes advantage of the format in a satisfying way i think some of the visual effects lose their luster when rendered against the human characters but kong and godzilla look the best they ever have shoutout to the motion capture performers behind them especially kong who do such an incredible job of making each monster feel lifelike your point about kong mcclane is so fitting hes a grizzled old vet at this point and the performance conveys that accordingly  the film is also awash in plenty of vibrant hues from hollow earths interiors to godzillas magenta glow once he goes super syain rose we rightfully knock some modernday blockbusters for looking bland or boring but thats hardly the case here  any other closing thoughts here i think were big fans of how fun this feels even with some issues with the plot im a big fan of the genre for its simplicity what you want is what you get and new empire absolutely delivers in this regard  jl godzilla x kong the new empire is a movie made for me it was enjoyable and worked well as a bigscale movie theater experience it works on cartoonstyle levels of powerups and mech armor and tag team battles all over the world yet i feel its great that we have these different choices and styles for tokusatsu filmmaking you can have a deeply emotional realworld eventresponding film like minus one and you can have the showa and millennium eras influenced godzilla movie that also does right by the history of king kong i hope others just give themselves a chance to enjoy themselves and accept it for what its trying to be we have cool air vehicles and a giant orangutan doing ape capoeira while using a whip made from a spine it feels like godzilla fights something new every 20 minutes we are living in good toku times william and im just basking in it
Apr 8 2024,positive,if you saw godzilla vs kong you probably have a good idea of what to expect from this one a silly overthetop kaiju with one hell of a battle at the end
Apr 8 2024,negative, the latest blockbuster of 2024 is this disappointing fifth entry in the socalled monsterverse franchise owned by legendary pictures about half of the film contain actors while half of it is computergenerated  the likely brief future of cinema before ai takes over completely in the battle for credibility between monsters and actors the actors here come off decidedly worse
Apr 8 2024,positive, i for one have thoroughly enjoyed legendarys monsterverse movie franchise godzilla x kong the new empire makes for the fifth film in the shared universe which dates all the way back to 2014 and gareth edwards terrific godzilla its considered the 38th film of the entire godzilla franchise and the 13th king kong feature it sees the return of director adam wingard who helmed the previous installment 2021s godzilla vs kong initial reactions to this newest entry have been interesting while early box office numbers have been impressive the critics responses have been mixed one reason is because some have unfortunately and unfairly pitted it against last years exceptional and more seriousminded godzilla minus one if anything the longrunning godzilla franchise has proven that you can do a lot of different things with the titular characters wingard understands that and sticks with his wild rock em sock em kaiju formula im glad he did after defeating mechagodzilla in the last movie kong has descended back down to hollow earth  the vast world below our planets surface where he carries on his search for his ancestors meanwhile on the surface godzilla continues his fight against the titans who frequently spring up and cause trouble as the last film established godzilla and kong dont like each other but as long as they stay out of each others territory there should be nothing to worry aboutright back at monarch the wellfunded secret organization that specializes in the monitoring titan activity dr ilene andrews rebecca hall has been elevated to head of kong research she and her team keep an eye on kong while others within the vast monarch follow godzilla around the globe trying to predict his next moves at home irenes young adopted daughter jia kaylee hottle remains the last surviving member of skull islands iwi tribe who has a special connection to kong shes suddenly stricken with traumatic visions triggered by an unidentified signal emanating from hollow earth irene seeks the help of titan enthusiast and podcaster bernie hayes a returning brian tyree henry and titan veterinarian trapper dan stevens who accompany her to hollow earth where kong has discovered an uncharted region full of secrets meanwhile the mysterious signal stirs up godzilla who begins preparing for a potential new and terrifying threat as you can probably guess its all working toward a titansized clash which wingard and his digital effects team have a blast setting up and executing the cgiheavy visuals are pretty spectacular and often help to energize the movie this proves to be important especially as the heavy doses of mythology begin to wear a little thin admittedly its impossible to deny the silliness of it all at the same time that very same silliness is a big part of what makes the movie fun and wingards snappy pacing makes sure youre not dwelling on too much for too long of course the bread and butter of the new empire is the titan throwdowns and we get some really good ones fans will relish the massive destructiondriven battles the films playful selfawareness and the classic monster movie feel wingard and his trio of writers terry rossio simon barrett and jeremy slater make no bones about the movie theyre making its pure popcorn entertainment and throwback escapism if you didnt like the previous monsterverse entry im not sure youll go for this one me im already excited for the next installment godzilla x kong the new empire is in theaters now i do think it possible the release of godzilla minus one has reset some hopes and expectations a bit for what a godzilla movie could and should be going forward even if it is a standalone film and not part of the monsterverse series minus one may very well have been the best movie i saw from last year but my wife and i were careful not to let that color our thoughts on this film that being said we did not enjoy this one at all  i think it was that silliness you alluded to which we could not push past glad you enjoyed it well be interested to see where this series takes us next thats actually what i like most about the godzilla franchiseits ability to go into all directions  from superserious minus one to more lighthearted this one i rewatched the previous film before going in so it put me back into its sphere which made a difference  my expectations were low because frankly i havent enjoyed these movies since the 2014 godzilla that said i had loads of fun kong using baby kong as nunchucks godzilla doing a suplex pure popcorn entertainment as you say and nails the saturday morning cartoon vibe also theres a sizable silent movie stretch where its just the monsters nonverbal fighting and roaring at each other it kinda took my breath away im glad to see someone finally praising this movie and having the ability to explain why ive not cared for the monarch story in the movies or the apple tv show but ive enjoyed them because i enjoy the monsters and fights i still havent seen minus one so ill have to make that happen since it sounds more like what i enjoy these beasts being  i as you can tell had a really good time with this one it is exactly what it sets to be looking forward to seeing it one more time before it leaves the big screen
Apr 7 2024,positive, some films are just criticproof we critics have to sit down and try to come up with an indepth review looking at the films cinematic excellence certain films make this a challenge in reality most people dont care  these movies have other priorities  they are simply meant to be enjoyed as an audience we know what we expect from godzilla x kong the new empire the question is does it deliver does the new monster picture bring the rock em sock em goodness we all deserve or do the monsters play second fiddle to the humans read on  godzilla x kong the new empire follows the continuing story of monarch and the mysterious monsters of yore more specifically godzilla and king kong the world is finally in a good place ish kong lives on hollow earth meanwhile godzilla is up on the surface world as long as these two never meet things should be dandy however life is thrown into chaos when godzilla picks up on a mysterious sos signal whos trying to invade the surface world will either titan be able to handle the threat on their own rebecca hall brian tyree henry dan stevens and kaylee hottle costar in the movie adam wingard directs godzilla x kong the new empire from a script by terry rossio simon barrett and jeremy slater  theres one question on the tip of everyones tongue when a movie like this comes out we dont go see these for the humans its the monster battles were there to revel in we know this this has been somewhat of a struggle in certain franchise entries when this one really steps up to the plate to let kong and godzilla do their thing it is an awful lot of fun this is perhaps most true in the films second half landmarks are destroyed cities are flattened and theres no grounding in reality while it never feels like enough this installment takes another step toward embracing what this action should feel like this is transformers for the monster scene we need pummeling action we deserve pummeling action in the grand scheme of things the film probably takes a bit too long to get to the true good stuff while the fight scenes are big loud and radioactive sometimes theres an awful lot of time between them as mentioned this is particularly true in the first act and a half as soon as the story reaches its midpoint theres plenty of godzilla x kong action to go around they just take a bit of time to meet up  that leads to the next most important question the visuals obviously godzilla wont come trotting out of his trailer at this juncture large portions of this film are being created deep inside a computer unfortunately godzilla x kong the new empire is not visually groundbreaking an imax screening yielded some grainy moments during some of the most intricate shots as well as some clumsy attempts to integrate humans into the monstrous action while nothing is offensively bad the moments did sometimes stand out  it has been often said that humans really arent needed in these films oftentimes they are merely a distraction from the action however godzilla x kong the new empire gifts us with something we really didnt know we needed in 2024 dan stevens and brian tyree henry get these two actors into a buddy comedy stat stevens and tyree henry find an easy and entertaining chemistry that lights up the screen when were forced to watch the humans both look to be having a blast and its worthy of a callout dan stevens has entered his matthew mcconaughey era and this critic is here for it meanwhile tyree henry keeps going with the goodness he started in the last film lots more of these two please  outside of stevens and henry rebecca hall is her usual fabulous self while shes always a delight to watch shes saddled with some of the films most awkward script moments many of these revolve around that ageold cinematic conundrum the exposition dump two moments stand out one of which stops the movie cold albeit briefly while the other is so convenient its almost silly no spoilers at the same time though shes also the films heart its emotional center and we love that for her shes rebecca hall she can do it all  when all is said and done godzilla x kong the new empire comes into theaters this week with one purpose giving audiences fabulous monsterfueled battles while there probably arent as many as there could be and they do take some time to get there what the movie does give us is big loud and fun watch it on the biggest screen you can get and make sure to buy some popcorn this criticproof film was exactly what it needed to be a heck of a lot of fun  a film nerd from my earliest years watching abbott and costello that eventually translated to a masters degree in film history i spend my time working on my fiction projects in all their forms as well as covering film and television

Apr 5 2024,neutral, recently he won his first academy award for a careerhigh performance as a visual effect in the single best motion picture of his long radioactively hot career godzilla minus one in adam wingards godzilla x kong the new empire the beast with fiery halitosis reverts to the quasiheroic less fearsome persona of the visually engaging yet problematic godzilla vs king kong 2021 also directed by wingard x also suffers from continuity challenges such as godzilla waking up from a nap inside the roman colosseum knocking it down as he exits later the colosseum has been magically restored to its earlier state of natural deterioration wingards cat curled up in a cat bed inspired him and production designer tom hammock to put this in the movie concentrating on sheer action x stages more than a simple rematch of godzilla with his hairied costar originally paired in the cheesy king kong vs godzilla a 1963 usa release the two towering titans reluctantly join forces to save the surface earth from a powerful enemy a brutal hollow earth ape boss called the skar king wingard states in the production notes hes the quintessential evil dictator and civilizations around the world and throughout history have their version of an evil dictator should we read anything into skar kings fur being bright orange dr ilene andrews rebecca hall working for a monster research group called monarch returns here with her adopted daughter jia reprised by an adorable kaylee hottle a deaf orphan found on kongs home turf skull island also returning bernie hayes a comedy relief knowitall conspiracy theory buff reprised by a game brian tyree henry inexplicably andrews chooses him to be her main adviser and sidekick but three screenwriters carefully sidestep a prime opportunity to comment on the role conspiracy theorists play in current politics british actor dan stevens joins the cast as trapper an amiable allpurpose cocky good guy who likes to go into action while playing pop songs he knows more than an omniscient voiceover narrator he can fly helicopters pull and replace a large infected ape tooth and serve as a human google search on any topic necessary to propel the plot an older wiser and lonelier kong sports a graying beard and sad eyes as a middleaged monster whose new cyborglike metal hand can deflect godzilla fire like wonder womans bracelets a cute bratty hollow earth kid gorilla called suko comes into kongs lonely life suko resembles a cheap lessdetailed animated character from a 1990s video game stuck in the uncanny valley between cartoons and his more photorealistic costars if some of the gargantuan gladiator battles look suspiciously like professional wrestlers at work that would be a nod to rkos original 1933 king kong directors merian c cooper and ernest b schoedsack both worked as professional wrestlers and used their experiences to stage the classic stopmotion battle between a giant gorilla and a tyrannosaurus rex the 13th king kong movie x is also the 38th godzilla feature an odd mix of fantasy action and nonsense capped by a headscratching choice of songs badfingers day after day
Apr 5 2024,positive, there are sequences in the latest monsterverse adventure godzilla x kong the new empire during which i felt like returning director adam wingard godzilla vs kong was let loose to do whatever the heck he and his cadre of writers including frequent collaborator simon barrett wanted free of any studio shackles there are long stretches in this installment when heroic ape kong wanders around the wilds of hollow earth fending off a variety of creatures or trapping for a midafternoon snack while also searching for other giant apes similar to himself these bits are sublime kong uses his intellect to set inventive snares to sucker predators into becoming his prey nurses a nasty toothache and still makes time to check in on his favorite human the last surviving member of skull islands iwi community jia kaylee hottle later on when he goes to investigate the subterranean regions of hollow earth the titan finally runs across an entire civilization of emaciated and angry apes who have been trapped near the earths molten core for unimaginable eons this all builds to an extended sequence in which kong befriends a young primate by showing him kindness instead of cruelty it also leads him into the middle of a conflict he cannot hope to end on his own and that also unwittingly puts the fate of the planet in serious jeopardy kong faces off against the vindictive and conniving skar king an elder simian who has subjugated hollow earths surviving apes to his will and who wants to destroy humanity all of these moments are aces while the overabundance of cgi during these sequences is undeniably noticeable wingard still manages to make things feel real even if as a viewer i always knew everything up on the screen was made on a computer and not on a sound stage the visual flow is kinetically impressive while the sound design is equally excellent these scenes are also strikingly edited by monsterverse veteran josh schaeffer and there is a wonderful clarity to the set pieces that in lesser hands could have easily become nothing more than 20minute bursts of colorfully nonsensical chaos granted as great as all of this may be theres no way the producers would let wingard make a twohour faux nature documentary chronicling massive titans in their natural habitats both above and below the surface of the earth a human element must be introduced at the very least to explain what the heck is going on and why anyone watching should care while this facet of a godzillacentered motion picture has typically been serviceably silly over the past 70 years you can count all of the exceptions on one hand for fans  and i am a big one  its equally not that much of a problem either there are exceptions of course and no matter which era of godzilla you want to look at showa heisei millennium youre going to find a few notable misfires so far as goofy as theyve gotten the monsterverse has managed to avoid this trap but dang does the new empire test that theory every new plot element comes with a gigantic helping of expository word vomit and this becomes increasingly annoying as the plot steamrolls toward its forgone pugilistic conclusion brian tyree henry returning as titan conspiracy theory podcaster bernie hayes is called upon to deliver the majority of it while his comic timing and dramatic commitment to the material is unsurprisingly laudable he did just receive a welldeserved academy award nomination for his superlative performance in 2022s causeway after all it still feels like the only reason his character is around is to explain what the heck is going on and thats unfortunate it also does not help that rebecca hall back as monarchs kong expert and jias adoptive mother ilene andrews has practically nothing to do other than to look wideeyed at all the mystifying peculiarities hollow earth has to offer or somberly sulk at the possibility she may lose her beloved daughter to this strange new world the actor makes the most of what she has to work with but as monumentally talented as hall is the lemonade she squeezes from these particular lemons still leaves a bitter aftertaste the one human character who does make a continually positive impression is trapper kongs dentist whose loopy enthusiasm for his work even in the face of almost certain death is gloriously infectious portrayed with euphoric selfconfidence by dan stevens this is one of the best performances in the entire monsterverse trapper is a continuous jolt of anarchic energy and if wingard ever decided to make an entire film following this guy around in his daytoday kaiju veterinary responsibilities id be first in line to watch it events climax with the requisite giantcreature slugfest this time in rio de janeiro while the skar king shouldnt be much of a match for the combined might of godzilla and kong theres a secret reason the cantankerous alpha titans must once again join forces to bring down a common enemy and im not about to spoil what that is im also not going to go into why jia is an integral player in the carnage but anyone familiar with showa or heiseiera godzilla films will be able to quickly figure out why a potentially telepathic young girl with the ability to communicate with monsters may be important much like with godzilla vs kong wingard shows hes up to the challenge of staging these battles the crashes are substantive the booms make an impression and the whizbang amazes but i do miss the sense of overwhelming awe that was present in all three of the first monsterverse entries godzilla kong skull island godzilla king of the monsters and at a certain point watching buildings get smashed by these allpowerful creatures does get tiresome but only slightly thanks to a handful of creatively unexpected flourishes coupled with wingards confident handling of the material i still found plenty to enjoy while godzilla x kong the new empire did on occasion test my patience the overall ride does remain a fun one and because of that im still willing to remain seated on the monsterverses bandwagon  for now we are dedicated to creating a distinguished user experience and a website rich in content with solid execution our

Apr 5 2024,positive, marking the fifth installment in the legendarywarner bros monsterverse franchise godzilla x kong the new empire digs deep into the mythology of these socalled titans while also attempting to clear a path for what might come next without getting too deep into the plot the film attempts to give us more details about the history of the hollow earth skull island and why these titans keep popping back up on the surface of the planet to destroy things like entire cities or the pyramids naturally there is a lot of exposition and speechifying by the human characters but no one is paying much attention to that we want monsters fighting and we want that frequently and on that front the new empire delivers solidly it not only tickles me greatly that adam wingard returns as director following 2021s godzilla vs kong but that he brings along with him his regular writing partner simon barrett terry rossio and jeremy slater also get a writing credit as well as actor dan stevens who last paired with wingard and barrett in the guest 10 years ago stevens plays an adventurer and some manner of animal expert named trapper one of the few new characters in the film hes old friends with ilene andrews a returning rebecca hall who is basically in charge of the titanmonitoring project which has been very active of late her young adopted deaf daughter and native skull islander jia kaylee hottle is also still around trying to adapt to conventional schooling and not taking to it well titan podcaster bernie hayes brian tyree henry is also back tagging along and requiring everyone to explain things to him in english so that the audience can attempt to figure out what the hell is going on but eventually everyone finds themselves going back into the hollow earth where kong has discovered that he isnt the last of his kind after allsomething that was hinted at in the last filmand that not all of the others like him are as protective and nurturing as he is the best part about the new empire is that rather than have the film build up to a massive creature fight wingard and company keep up the action pace pretty consistently but the films final battle sequence is truly one of the best in this franchise we already know that this time around kong and godzilla team up to fight a great opponent and watching them run side by side into battle is truly a sight to behold and one i never thought id see even though weve seen some of these characters before im not sure we learn much more about them we actually also discover in the course of the movie that jias tribe has been hiding in hollow earth for quite a long time and her reunion with them is moving especially thanks to a terrific performance by fala chen as the iwi queen and stevens knows exactly the tone to take for these movies which isnt necessarily the ultraserious one that so many others are working in hes having fun learning new things about these creatures and his joy is contagious although im sure there will be more of these films there isnt much of a teaser for upcoming storylines at the end of the new empire which is both surprising and refreshing but knowing where something comes from doesnt always make the characters or situations better and i think its time this franchise looked to the future into allnew adventures without as many history lessons im excited to see where things go from here and i hope most of this team is in place to move it forward did you enjoy this post and our coverage of chicagos  arts scene please consider supporting third coast reviews arts and culture coverage by making a donation by paypal choose the amount that works best for you and know how much we appreciate your support steve prokopy is chief film critic for the chicagobased arts outlet third coast review for nearly 20 years he was the chicago editor for aint it cool news where he contributed film reviews and filmmakeractor interviews under the name capone currently hes a frequent contributor at film slashfilmcom and backstory magazine he is also the public relations director for chicagos independently owned music box theatre and holds the position of vice president for the chicago film critics association in addition he is a programmer for the chicago critics film festival which has been one of the citys most anticipated festivals since 2013 support third coast review and our coverage of chicago arts and culture by making a small monthly pledge on patreon or by making a donation on paypal enjoying third coast review news and reviews please consider supporting our arts and culture coverage by making a small monthly pledge or making a donation via paypal choose the amount that works best for you and know how much we appreciate your support
Apr 5 2024,neutral, the monsterverse is back with godzilla x kong the new empire the fifth film in the franchise and followup to the 2021 smash godzilla vs kong which proved to be the blockbuster that kickstarted the box office following covid while there is nothing inherently bad in the latest film godzilla still feels like it is stuck on a hamster wheel just going through the motions its a cookiecutter big budget blockbuster that checks all the boxes without having any real imagination godzilla finds things sort of back to normal after the titans battled in the previous film kong is adjusting to life in the hollow earth while godzilla is on the surface protecting humans from any potential danger when a mysterious signal is detected on hollow earth it threatens the balance of this new normal dr ilene andrews rebecca hall along with her adopted daughter jia kaylee hottle the last remaining survivor of iwi tribe from skull island set out on a quest to find the signal in hollow earth while their adventure is happening godzilla is being monitored as he appears to be gearing up for a yet to be revealed new enemy to the films credit godzilla zips by in just under two hours with director adam wingard keeping things moving at a brisk pace there is some really imaginative attention to details to flesh out hollow earth and the addition of some new creatures and an appearance by an og monster that are fun in the moment  especially a young primate named suko who becomes kongs ally the cast is ok too even if they are just there to take a backseat to the creatures hall brings some instant credibility to her role while bryan tyree henry is clearly having fun as the conspiracy theory blogger who joins the team on the journey to hollow earth it all comes together in an acceptable fashion with every piece working as best as it can the biggest problem with this installment is an unknown factor it probably never saw coming the release of godzilla minus one less than six months ago minus one was such a breath of fresh air for the franchise that it is a hard act to follow  a film that set the bar so high it would be nearly impossible to try to match it by comparison this godzilla just feels like a run of the mill cgi extravaganza that to its credit delivers what it promises but doesnt really have the same imagination and creativity of minus one the result is a franchise that feels stuck in the mud in need of a bit of a jolt the final act hints at future films and the opening weekend at the box office certainly suggests more installments are on the way here is hoping they can be a little more creative than this one which isnt really that bad or that good  its just there in the middle of the road doing as little as possible to build off the franchises previous and better installments
Apr 5 2024,positive, the letter x in godzilla x kong the new empire is silent apparently it is just about the only silent thing about the latest entry in the monsterverse which sees the two titular titans put aside their differences to join forces against an existential threat the followup to the immensely fun godzilla vs kong 2021 godzilla x kong delivers on its tantalising actionpacked promise even if the other elements mostly let the side down  all seems well in titan town with godzilla patrolling the surface world and kong establishing his dominion over the hollow earth this harmony is disrupted when kong discovers a secret underground society of giant apes led by the tyrannical and spindlylimbed skar king the skar king wants to lead a conquest of the planet and possesses a terrifyingly powerful prisoner to help him do it kong realising he cannot defeat this evil alone must convince godzilla  now looking pretty in pink and taking cat naps inside the colosseum  to team up with him in a script taken straight out of wwe theres even a suplex godzilla vs kong proved to be one of the pandemicafflicted cinema seasons biggest hits and adam wingard is the monsterverses first returning director with gareth edwards jordan vogtroberts and michael dougherty previously taking the reins of different films suitably then this is a director willing to showcase some swagger wingard finds some absurd silly moments of humour almost guaranteed to bring a smile to your face kong knocking out one mouthy ape with a single blow and godzilla highdiving off the rock of gibraltar are particular highlights wingard has the confidence to colourfully bring out the personality of his monsters building on the groundwork of godzilla vs kong and having some serious fun while doing so  the visual style goes harder on the detail colour and imagination crystallised shimmering pillars tower over lush green habitats while cities come crashing down in an even more dramatic fashion than before visually these films have rarely looked better bringing the above and belowground worlds to life with a vividness and creativity that really works overtime the effects work on kong in particular is outstanding he looks more expressive and detailed than ever before the visual effects team deserve massive credit for making a cgi gorilla outact every human being in the cast the film looks great but sadly shares similar issues to many of its predecessors particularly godzilla king of the monsters 2019 the human element is lacking it was a wise decision to cut down and concentrate the number of human characters this time around but the flip side of that is that they now have more to do and when the script lumps them with little more than exposition and mild comic relief they feel like a burden with little to offer other than obvious observations and oneliners dan stevens happily hams it up as a titan veterinarian seemingly the only character at ease with just how crazy the whole thing is but his apparent history with dr ilene andrews a returning rebecca hall is mentioned once and never brought up again even halls relationship with kia kaylee hottle while touching is handled in a sedate predictable manner the monsterverse has proved with monarch legacy of monsters 2023 that it can do detailed human characters so there is little excuse for anything else anymore  the story is also very lopsided more so than godzilla vs kong which blended the necessary explanations and theorisations with bonecrunching kaiju action far more fluidly the skar king is introduced at a very late stage with the promised brawl only coming towards the films dying moments the entire first half of the film minus a few brief scuffles is mostly spent moving all of the pieces into place in a frustratingly reserved manner godzilla x kong is just not balanced as it should be and the pace really suffers for it happily when the final showdown comes it hits the mark the only letdown perhaps being that it isnt slightly longer a recurring point about kongs dental issues has a gleeful callback and the battle is just as overthetop as you could hope for a brief rematch between godzilla and kong is also very satisfying taken up a notch by kongs shiny new mechanised gauntlet wingard and the monsterverse have nailed how to do the headlinecatching goliath fights its everything else that still needs some work 
Apr 5 2024,positive, if you sat a monsterverse novice down and played gareth edwards 2014 godzilla against adam wingards godzilla x kong the new empire the departure of the quality would be so staggering it would give that person whiplash or anyone for that matter how did we go from a largescoped and painstakingly crafted blockbuster to a cgmonster fight fest franchise where kong and godzilla coexist as frenemies the previous monsterverse installment godzilla vs kong centered on the big boys duking it out  something we all wanted to see now warner bros and legendary pictures are squeezing their titan juices because the new empire has the boys fighting side by side its the worst timing at least for godzilla fans  in his new home of hollow earth kong longs for fellowship the same goes for kongs human companion jia kaylee hottle the last of her iwi tribe who has become dr ilene andrews rebecca hall of the kongspecialized monarch divisions adopted daughter both parties have a difficult time adjusting to their new homes lord knows kong cant return to the surface for godzilla takes it as his domain when jia experiences visions of a voice calling out for her a chain of events ripples across both the surface and hollow earth  seismic activity screwing up monarchs feed godzilla awakening and absorbing radiation from various sources across the world and a rift opening in hollow earth dr andrews enlists titan podcaster geek bernie hayes brian tyree henry a titan veterinarian named trapper dan stevens and jia into hollow earth to investigate the source of the signal what they find is a crystalized world protected by an iwi tribe meanwhile kong discovers other apelike creatures and goes on a quest with a rambunctious apechild suko and leads him to a new threat named scar king a tyrannical ape who plans to take over the surface world kong must trek to the surface world to find godzilla and team up with him to take scar king down  first the title may be godzilla x kong but this installment is a kong flick feat godzilla the giant dumb lizard makes cameo appearances until the meandering plot from terry rossio simon barrett and jeremy slater requires him to show up the only representation from the latters movies is brian tyree henrys bernie introduced in gvk but now switches sides since the writers catapult him into the kong monarch teams adventure as someone who swings more toward the big ape than the giant lizard im not complaining that i got more of a kong flick i love that giant monkey  godzilla x kong is at its finest when no humans are in sight and the focus is solely on kong and his budding parental relationship with suko trekking across the new crystallized terrain within hollow earth the visuals tell a much more precise and entertaining story than all the human exploration and exposition mumbo jumbo the kong and suko sections are so god of war 2018 coded with kong wielding his bigass battle axe embarking on a dangerous quest with this juvenile kid ape whenever kong made a lets go nodding expression to suko i assumed he was going to speak and say boy they form a genuine bond and its the most engaging emotional aspect of the film if warner bros and legendary were daring and thought highly of their audience that dynamic would be enough to carry a whole movie without humans  while the vfx is a mixed bag throughout its during the kong portions that the art direction and cg artistry are at their best pulling off stunning shots wingards direction retains the same energetic and exuberant style as his predecessor within these portions  monsterverse screenwriters seem incapable of writing an enticing or coherent human tale to hold the picture together however dan stevens is the mvp as trapper he arrives on screen riding off the side of an aircraft donning a magnum pi outfit to investigate kongs infected tooth he gives the whole feature a jolt of liveliness that was desperately needed in the past few monsterverse installments and rightfully matches the stupid energy these movies operate on hes the functioning comedic relief that shares good chemistry with his costars cg or not the human plots in monsterverse movies tend to be forgettable yet takashi yamazaki mopped the floor with terry rossio simon barrett and jeremy slater who cant come up with anything outside of the tired exploration in cgterrain plotline with more convoluted story threads and stupid exposition a monster who was inexplicably murdered several movies ago is magically revived with no rhyme or reason and the film expects you to just go along with it  to be this lazy on the heels of godzilla minus one is embarrassing dont say oh you cant compare the two because one was set during wwii and this godzilla x kong is contemporary listen toho has made many godzilla movies and most are leaps and bounds better than this one i watched minus one on a whim after dropping my friend off at a saltburn award screening that i didnt want to be at one of those two titles ended up not getting any oscar nominations the other got a nom and won  toho raised the bar meanwhile wb is just commissioning products and needs to give its visual effects team more time to cook on a staggering 135 million budget to paraphrase jeff bridges in iron man takashi yamazaki built this on a 12 million budget with 35 vfx artists whats your excuse warner bros man i hope that minus ones win was a wakeup call for hollywood and what studios should strive for in storytelling and vfx to give a blockbuster an epic grandiose coat we deserve that over the flat weightless ps4era quality unrendered shots and shoddy designs that made me physically wince  we have another takeitorleave monsterverse movie for fans who just want to see kong and godzilla duke it out the new empire is a fanservice installment of unimpressive visual quality but theres potential to give the audience more than cgschlock in the future 
Apr 5 2024,positive,you really get your moneys worth for your monkeys worth
Apr 5 2024,positive,godzilla x kong the new empire cant hold a candle to last years godzilla minus one  and its nothing like as smart as gareth edwards 2014 godzilla relaunch but it is a likeable enough way to waste a couple of hours
Apr 5 2024,positive,i know this movie is dumb but i had a smile on my face the entire time
Apr 5 2024,positive,this is great fun a big dumb movie that tries to explain with scientific language how we get to a place called hollow earth
Apr 5 2024,negative, the story somewhere in india the impoverished kid dev patel makes a living fighting in underground matches his meagre earnings go towards a single goal  to find the men responsible for his wretched and lonely condition  cowritten and helmed by and starring british actor dev patel it combines hardhitting martial arts with a dash of the exploitation crime thriller  the bloodletting and bare skin on display are enough to warrant an r21 classification for sexual scenes and violence  patels lone wolf character might fight like a 1970s throwback but modern touches abound for example he fights like a demon because he has demons on the inside  his sleep is troubled by posttrauma flashbacks that give kid his obsession with retribution while the pummellings he dishes out are set to modern electronic dance music  on a separate note patels athleticism in fight scenes is breathtaking he makes keanu reeves title character from the john wick film series 2014 to present look like he moves in slow motion  it feels as if patel in his feature film directorial debut is showing a middle finger to an entertainment industry reluctant to cast a south asian male as the lead in a superhero movie because kids story is an origin tale of a mysterious masked vigilante right out of a marvel comic book  the monkey man persona kid adopts is a nod to the hindu deity hanuman while the villains he faces down represent an aspect of the region with every beatdown kid delivers he strikes a blow against systemic corruption social inequality and religious hypocrisy  think of lees character in fist of fury 1972 set in shanghai in the early 1900s looking at a sign at the front of the foreignrun park that says no dogs and chinese allowed patel taps the same vein of righteous anger while delivering on the promise of a satisfying payback  the story some years after the events of godzilla vs kong 2021 the two titans kong and godzilla now live in separate zones and so are in no danger of attacking each other the giant primate resides in hollow earth monitored by the monarch research organisation while the scaly one lives above ground a monarch outpost on hollow earth picks up a mysterious signal one that will bring the antagonistic creatures into contact characters such as dr ilene andrews rebecca hall and conspiracy theorist and podcaster bernie hayes brian tyree henry make a return from the previous film as does director adam wingard  the oscarwinning film has been held back from cinemas around the world because of legal obligations that forbid the american and japanese godzilla movies from being released in the same area at the same time the films have so far struggled to reconcile two contradictory elements  the need to put the fighting monsters on screen as much as possible while keeping the story focused on human affairs  the monsterverse franchise kicked off in 2014 with godzilla with the following films introducing kong kong skull island 2017 a wider bestiary in godzilla king of the monsters 2019 before bringing the two starring creatures together in 2021s godzilla vs kong the films and apple tv series monarch legacy of monsters 2023 have yet to match the quality of shin godzilla 2016 a japanese production that mocked clueless grandstanding politicians caught flatfooted by a disaster  so this is the overblown vapid result  a rambling series of plot contrivances aimed at maximising monster brawls for the second time kong and godzilla two supposedly deadly enemies become frenemies to defeat an even more menacing creature  dr andrews is the films moral centre while hayes is its comic relief and the entire affair tries to come off as a breezy lost world adventure especially when the devilmaycare character of trapper a veterinarian played by dan stevens enters the picture  the story jacqueline cynthia erivo is a refugee from wartorn liberia struggling to survive on the streets of a touristy greek coastal city she meets callie alia shawkat a tour guide despite their differences they form a friendship the film is based on alexander maksiks 2013 novel a marker to measure drift and adapted for the screen by maksik and susanne farrell there will be a postscreening questionandanswer session with singaporean director anthony chen at the 730pm show on april 6  drift marks a couple of firsts for chen it is his first feature with dialogue that is not mostly in mandarin as well as the first feature he has directed in which he is not listed in the writing credits  however it contains ideas that have become attached to his work  the way outsiders find kinship the need for solitude struggling against the hunger for connection and the female protagonist with secrets yearning to be seen for who she is but who sets protections around herself  erivos jacqueline is vulnerable so she is always on high alert much of the dramas first half is spent seeing the city through the eyes of this wary intelligent woman as she lives day to day  despite having precious few possessions she strives to keep herself clean and presentable she lives rough but selfcare is still a priority erivo delivers a magnetic performance as the woman holding on to the shreds of her former identity while learning to adapt to a new one in which she is either invisible or when noticed considered a pest  chens camera watches at a distance as she engages with beach tourists in a lowkey manner to make a few euros by giving foot massages she never tries to elicit pity nor does she make a nuisance of herself  the entrance of shawkats ebullient american tour guide callie gives the film a muchneeded shot of optimism  one roots for them to get closer so that the american with her firstworld resources can rescue the protagonist  this is not that sort of story the story here as far as chen is concerned is the ebb and flow of emotions as the women negotiate boundaries and find ways to communicate the damage caused

Apr 4 2024,neutral, you have to feel bad for godzilla not only does he have to followup the absolute masterclass of monster cinema that was godzilla minus one but in godzilla x kong the new empire the poor guy cant even get a few winks in the colosseum before the world once again demands he and kongs assistance to thwart yet another worldending threat  but hey at least this time he gets to radiate with an effervescent barbieesque pink hue you will have to see the film to know exactly why for this direct sequel to 2021s godzilla vs kong director adam wingard returns to craft a cgiloaded ridiculously plotted excessively edited monstersmashing sequel revolving around a dangerous foe in hollow earths skar king and his aims to toss monkey morality to the wind and do some real damage back on the mainland rebecca hall and kaylee hottle return as ilene andrews and her now adopted daughter jia after being rescued from skull island jia feels isolated from kong and many of the treasures of her homeland so when things with kong go sideways of course ilene allows her to tag along we are better for it though as their relationship is the dose of heart this film sorely needs as it continues the monsterverses largest sin forgetting human characters need to make some iota of sense returning from the previous film is brian tyree henrys bernie who gets very little of interest to do here thankfully director wingard called in his leading man from 2014s fantastic the guest dan stevens to liven things up as the unpredictably hilarious trapper please bring trapper back we need more of this insanity if we are to keep taking these plots seriously kong is again the primary focus and that continues to work due to the expertly utilized facial tics in the king kong designs kong cannot speak but we understand his every motive and movement which is a true testament to this effects team kong eventually encounters his own version of jia in suko an abandoned and borderline abused baby ape who kong takes under his wing for a bit of that tough monkey love for example winding suko up and twirling him around as a weapon like the worlds stretchiest baseball bat godzilla x kong the new empire is a monster movie through and through if youre interested in an emotional narrative with human characters that connect on a deeper level of empathy go watch godzilla minus one again because this is a freaking monster movie it has no time for character development while the story is admittedly weak and the humans are mostly wasted screen time the whambam thrills equal a reasonably good time in a theater

Apr 4 2024,neutral, godzilla and king kong use to have a beef now that theyve kissed and made up theres no real meat in this generic big creature smackdown  also any production involving godzilla or kong now stands in the shadow of the oscarwinning godzilla minus one theres no excuses anymore if writerdirector takashi yamazaki can craft a heartfelt script with threedimensional characters if yamazaki kiyoko shibuya masaki takashi and tatsuji nojima can conjure eyeballentrancing visual effects so stunning they garner the ultimate achievement in artistry an academy award then any filmmakers who come after them can step up if they really want to  jias adoptive mom dr ilene andrews rebeca hall resurrection and director of passing is the head of the kong research division for the secret organization monarch she takes her daughters inklings so seriously she enlists the help of bernie hayes brian tyree henry causeway a weirdo conspiracy theorist podcaster whose show titan truths is obsessed with the mega monsters something is up thats the buzz as the film progresses and an enigmatic signal attracts action to the hollow earth a hidden realm in the planets core more beasts are unearthed none look any more vivid than the two on the surface the verdant underworld landscape is interesting production designer tom hammock godzilla vs kong but the music tom holkenborg and antonio di iorio interior sets flying capsules costumes emily seresin and cinematography ben seresin dont enhance those scenes if there is a saving grace its that the fights battles and combat which lead up to a doordie climax with godzilla and kong teaming up to for the big brawl are well paced and measured throughout which should delight actionadventurescifi fans being original innovative or deep is not part of the scope of the script by directorwriter adam wingard godzilla vs kong and screenwriter terry rossio eg the chitchat on the space craft that flies jia bernie tanner and dr andrews to the center of the world and the monarch outpost is banal the shuttle is flown by the gruff pilot mikael alex ferns a mean taskmaster try not to swallow your tongue bernie the scared passenger what tanner is blasé jia hopeful and andrews in charge words and character development dont get much deeper than that wingards direction settles on the spectacle of the oversized fights but none are truly astonishing the only reason anyones heart will beat fast is because the loud soundtrack erik aadahl tends to make up for what is not visually impressive also some of the fights take place on dazzling international locations from the pyramids to the beaches of rio de janeiro pour on the fanciful geographical locations action pummeling bites body slams and a little deep freeze wizardly and hope for the best  fala chen as iwi queen has a majesty about her that gives the film some moments of dignity hottle displays an innocence that is beguiling when mikael meets an abrupt ending viewers will giggle  thats a sign that ferns did his job as the aggressive bully stevens interpretation of tanner remains steadfast throughout  cool collected and high on life while henrys interpretation of bernie seems too buffoonish  maybe the bromance between the reptile godzilla and primate king kong was a mistake maybe audiences will leave theaters invigorated but wondering wheres the beef
Apr 3 2024,negative, the most extraordinary feat in a film like godzilla x kong the new empire is its ability to convey a plethora of emotion from cgiderived nonverbal creatures its something director adam wingard and vfx supervisor alessandro ongaro accomplish particularly through kong and his primate cohorts but as with wingards first instalment in this iteration of the monsterverse the humans only get in the way wingards follow up to 2021s truly excellent godzilla vs kong explores the origins of the various creatures and wades deeper into hollow earth after the events of the first film the two monsters have reached a détente  godzilla hangs about in the surface world thrashing monsters that humans cant deal with while kong rules hollow earth the film briefly examines the loneliness of kong in his futile search for others of his kind that is until his senses lead him to find a whole new layer to hollow earth where more large primates live by introducing so many new creatures characters and locations while also trying to continue developing the already established world new empire ultimately succumbs to putting a hat on a hat on a hat wingard jumps around and rushes through an incredible amount of lore and unnecessary cinematic science to the point that only confusion remains and yet theres a nagging feeling that within all this hotpotato storytelling lies a pretty cool story involving kong and his brethren unlike godzilla vs kong the former doesnt get much screen time this time around although hes gotten enough shine of late with godzilla minus one and i personally will not complain wingard and ongaros imagining of the king of the beasts and his kind is aweinspiring and incredibly impressive through facial expressions and demonstrative body language alone the film connects audiences to kongs story in a way reminiscent of silent era films  but with more bellowing growls of course every second kong little kong and skar king are on screen its quietly engaging in a way that transcends the film as a whole if the computergenerated creatures of the film are the players in a silent film that compels audiences then the actual humans acting in the film are the intertitles save for the brief moments of comedy from the brian tyree henrydan stevens combo the humans simply exist to read out the wikipedia plot summary  expository monkeys if i may look all we want from our creature features is kong and godzilla decimating cities throwing donkey kong punches and mmaing the shit out of each other  just good wholesome entertainment is all new empire proves this to be the bread and butter of a modern day creature feature that can use the best technology to deliver on an entertaining slugfest it also proves that either the budget can be saved by removing actors from this genre altogether or the budget needs to be expanded to create scripts where actors are actually necessary
Apr 3 2024,negative,it starts out with a lot of promise but it takes itself too seriously and becomes tedious also not much godzilla for a godzilla x kong movie
Apr 3 2024,neutral,i like this movie strictly as a cartoonish action comedy there are few surprises but there is lots of action most of it of the animated variety i also liked it because i am a 3d fan and this 3d conversion is very good
Apr 2 2024,neutral,as much fun as it is to watch the titans fight at some point you go like whats the point of this
Apr 2 2024,positive, while the clunkilytitled godzilla x kong the new empire might not initially seem it it would be a great doublebill with oppenheimer as the two films bookend 80 years of storytelling that have helped us comprehend and process the terror man has inflicted upon himself with that nuclear power  godzilla or gojira emerged as a monstermovie staple in postwar and posthiroshima japan a parable about the destructive power of nuclear energy the creature has starred in nearly 40 films in the years since produced by japanese company toho and a handful of hollywood studios  theres a whole bunch of worldbuilding that has been going on with the godzilla franchise the last dozen films both japanese and american have been feeding an almost marvel cinematic universe approach to longterm storytelling for those who want to jump into this film without seeing those 38 other features there is a terrific series called monarch legacy of monsters that recently launched on the appletv platform it ties all of those films together with the king kong movies in this film which carries on from the 2021 film godzilla vs kong the world powersthatbe seem have accepted that the giant skyscrapersized lightningbreathing lizard monster godzilla while causing urban destruction everywhere he goes seems to do so only in the cause of protecting the world from less wellintentioned monsters called titans  hes not a fan of the giant gorilla king kong but monarch scientist ilene andrews rebecca hall solved that problem by just as with feeding puppies or threeyearolds separating them  in earlier films monarch discovered another subterranean world within the core of our planet a journey to the centre of the earth situation and kong has been housed there but strange seismic activity takes dr andrews to this subterranean world with a team including vet trapper dan stevens former scientist turned monarch truther bernie hayes brian tyree henry and dr andrewss adoptive daughter jia kaylee hottle  if you love these silly monster flicks this did sound like it was going to be a ton of fun but it doesnt entirely live up to its potential  the performances are fine with rebecca hall as strong as she always is and brian tyree henry and dan stevens delivering the goofy comic relief roles the writing isnt terrific and the setup dialogue and obnoxious music choices that accompany stevens every appearance try to set him up as some kind of epic michael bay character that might have worked in a full cinema but mine was not  its so terrific to see kiwi actress rachel house in quite a decentsized minor role as a monarch executive shes a great comedic actress so i was preparing to laugh every time she spoke but she was purely the straight man with kong and godzilla getting most of the films slapstick routines  the cgi work is really good or at least noticeably actually finished unlike the sloppy work that ruined the last half dozen marvel and dcu films much of that cgi is really selfindulgent widespread destruction of a number of cities including rome and rio de janeiro this might be considered fun escapism if we werent witnessing some epic reallife urban destruction on our front pages a bit too much this past week 
Apr 2 2024,neutral, the epic battle continues legendary pictures cinematic monsterverse follows up the explosive showdown of godzilla vs kong with an allnew adventure that pits the almighty kong and the fearsome godzilla against a colossal undiscovered threat hidden within our world challenging their very existenceand our own godzilla x kong the new empire delves further into the histories of these titans and their origins as well as the mysteries of skull island and beyond godzilla x kong the new empire refreshingly showcases kongs maturity and development over time i enjoyed witnessing his fights where the situations reflected his character more than his brute strength or cunning his interactions with other monsters were captivating particularly the interactions with mini kong i thought those were kind of funny and enjoyable to watch it was fascinating to see the development of their relationship godzilla despite not appearing as frequently in the film still presented a significant threat for everyone to face i appreciated how godzillas portrayal remained consistent depicting him as a force of nature with a clear objective his interactions with kong were also entertaining as both titans showcased their respective strengths another positive for godzilla x kong was the handling of the human characters this time around they didnt feel as annoying their stories remained mostly focused on the monsters more so than their personal drama they certainly could have benefited from a lesser supportive role but they did serve the story well enough lastly the worldbuilding for godzilla x kong was stunning the visual effects included some vivid imagery and colors that were captivating to see they also really sold the notion that the hollow earth was a completely new world the vfx used for the monsters was also pretty impressive the titans seemed believable enough to be real and i never thought twice about it while watching while some of the fights in the movie were entertaining to watch some moments were simply too cringy to bear i was not a fan of the scenes where certain monsters would fight and appear to be too humanistic in their battle tactics for example theres one monster fight where a creature does a fullon wrestling move to another monster while already in a state of suspended belief this really pushed the envelope too far the film did better in relying on the more primal fighting techniques of the creatures rather than adopting silly wrestling moves the technology in godzilla x kong becomes a bit too highbrow its understood that some technological advancements were necessary such as travel to and from the hollow earth however later in the film it introduces more scientific concepts that seem to be more of a distraction i understood why it made sense for the sake of the story but it felt overly complicated given the explanations provided plus once you witness the scientific phenomena occur it feels like a visual chaotic mess until things settle down for the final showdown speaking of which the villain in godzilla x kong proved rather underwhelming there wasnt enough buildup about the monster individually to make it feel like a genuine threat the gimmick used by the villain did raise some stakes but without that gimmick the villain was a complete disappointment this of course made the final battle a letdown even though it had so much potential godzilla x kong the new empire is a fun albeit flawed addition to the monsterverse godzilla x kong the new empire delivers on its promise of epic monster battles but falls short in some key areas while the quantity of monsters is impressive the quality of their interactions and the complexity of the plot leave something to be desired having overthetop scientific jargon reminded me of the film tenet couple that with the ridiculous corny wrestling moves and scripted drama and one could easily think christopher nolan and wwe made a monster movie together more specifically the same way tenet felt unnecessarily overexplanatory and highconcept this film did the same so much so that it kind of robbed me from just sitting back and enjoying titans fighting it out on the big screen nevertheless godzilla x kong the new empire was an ok entry into the monsterverse for those wondering the answer is no this did not even compare to the masterpiece that is godzilla minus one  there is no postcredit scene so please do not feel the need to wait for more feel free to check out godzilla x kong the new empire in theaters godzilla x kong the new empire will be in theaters march 29 2024 be sure to follow emans movie reviews on facebook subscribe on youtube or follow me on twitterig emansreviews for even more movie news and reviews
Apr 2 2024,positive, its easter weekend and for south florida cinephiles its the calm before the storm this resting place is the perfect time to catch up with bigscale studio offerings before plunging into festival frenzy thats right the miami film festival sprang forward from its traditional march berth to its current dates of april 514 meaning it will be unspooling back to back with the miami edition of outshine april 1828 the ripple effects of the date change remain to be seen will it benefit both events or will one festival rise to the surface while the other sinks the different audiences line of defense holds little weight to those of us who would like to keep attending both events and may now have to make some difficult choices dan stevens as trapper rebecca hall as dr ilene andrews and kaylee hottle as jia in a scene from godzilla x kong the new empire photo credit dan mcfadden courtesy of warner bros pictures but lets cross that bridge when we get to it before us we have two bigbudget tentpoles that sell nostalgia while trying to rope in a younger generation one is a supernatural blend of laughs and chills that returns its franchise to its original urban setting the other throws together its jumbosized walking allegories to see if they can work together instead of surrendering to their alphamale instincts to beat each other to a pulp godzilla x kong the new empire king kong has a toothache and his pain doesnt stop there this muscular chapter in the universal monsterverse saga begins with a wordless sequence that follows the big apes daily routine on hollow earth the hidden realm beneath our planets surface where we last saw him three years ago he can hold his own in these harsh darwinian surroundings but fending off other predators underlines the sense that he doesnt belong there even more so it drives home the engulfing loneliness for someone whos under the impression that hes the last of his kind but new empire doesnt dwell too much on existential angst director adam wingard who also helmed its predecessor godzilla vs kong wants to show you a good time and he has crafted an eyepopping thrill ride that not only delivers the slambang goods but restores a sense of awe and wonder to these monster mashes  rebecca hall as dr ilene andrews and brian tyree henry as bernie hayes in a scene from godzilla x kong the new empire photo credit dan mcfadden courtesy of warner bros pictures i was initially miffed when humans entered the picture since the prospect of a godzillaking kong crossover told entirely from the creatures point of view felt like a very enticing proposition but even with the homo sapiens characters new empire shows a marked improvement over the 2021 film itself a serviceable genre entry that didnt reinvent the wheel but didnt require viewers to have an encyclopedic knowledge of the lore to enjoy themselves dr ilene andrews rebecca hall now sporting a new shorterhaired look is struggling to connect with jia kaylee hottle the last surviving member of the iwi tribe who called skull island kongs old abode home before it was destroyed ilene has since adopted the girl who is beset by nightmarish visions that prevent her from getting through a day at school without freaking out her classmates ilene is concerned about her adoptive daughters wellbeing as the head of kong research at monarch the covert organization monitoring these giant creatures called titans she is also concerned about an unidentified signal that may point to trouble down below which likely means it will spill over to the planets surface she

stevens a veterinarian who knows his giant monsters with his red hawaiian shirt laidback demeanor and holistic approach to adversity trapper ends up being the shot in the arm the movie needs turning what could have been a listless globetrotting adventure into a freewheeling spectacle stevens who previously worked with wingard as the titular ticking time bomb in the violent thrillerslasher film the guest is clearly having a ball playing the groovy doc youll want what hes having no bad vibes allowed but trapper and stevens irresistible star turn are only the tip of the iceberg wingard working from a screenplay credited to terry rossio simon barrett and jeremy slater has a couple of secrets up his sleeve and a big part of what makes new empire such a treat is the way it keeps expanding on its mythology each revelation made this movie nerd beam the most satisfying new additions to the monsterverses cast of big critters are two big primates suko a reddishfurred juvenile who crosses paths with kong perhaps has the most satisfying arc though hes initially such a backstabbing jerk part of me didnt want him to change his wicked ways then theres the skar king an older ape who is so deliciously cunning and evil he is literally a slave driver its clear wingard knows his indiana jones movies this is the villain i was looking for carrie coon as callie spengler finn wolfhard as trevor spengler paul rudd as gary grooberson annie potts as janine mckenna grace as phoebe spengler logan kim as podcast dan aykroyd as ray stantz james acaster as lars and celeste oconnor as lucky in a scene from ghostbusters frozen empire photo by jaap buitendijkcourtesy of sony pictures entertainment inc this is not to diminish the growth that kong shows here the iconic simian often depicted as a destructive force of nature shows newfound resolve even leadership skills in new empire the same cannot be said of his scaly adversaryturnedreluctantcollaborator and if theres something that this film skimps on its godzilla wingard and his creative team are juggling so many elements that the giant lizard is too often reduced to a plot device coming months after japans oscarwinning godzilla minus one the relative short shrift that the apex predator is given here is all the more glaring even though the cityleveling buttkicking remains a thrill to experience under wingards assured stewardship he is capably backed up by the retro sounds of antonio di iorio and tom holkenborgs score which alternates between 80sthrowback synthesizers and rousing orchestral swells there are nits to be picked with new empire in addition to the reduced godzilla presence the movie tries to cover too many bases with arguably enough content for two jampacked extravaganzas but when the results are this exhilarating the vastness of its scope so richly rendered thats hardly a dealbreaker wingard whose past horror work often had a mean streak has crafted a nifty demolition derby with a big pulsating heart much like the touchyfeely trapper its a hugger also an absolute blast ghostbusters frozen empire theres a chill in the air in this latest installment of the paranormal problem solvers and its coming from the ghosts of better supernatural action comedies unremarkable but not unwatchable the fifth entry in the franchise started forty years ago by director ivan reitman and

will treat its otherwordly threat seriously but before theres a discernible payoff to the periodpiece trappings the movie jumps forward to present day with the kind of chase scene that an old studio hand like richard donner could have brought vividly to life its safe to say british filmmaker gil kenan monster house is no richard donner frozen empire is set two years after the events in

fan service and poor writing that ruined its predecessor it also repeatedly lets down phoebe its strongest most interesting character at every turn grace conveys the characters drive and fierce intelligence but the filmmakers do not follow suit forcing the rebellious frustrated teen to make stupid decisions in order to move the creaky plot forward most disappointing of all is the way it introduces melody emily alyn lind the ghost of a teen who perished in a fire as a new friend for phoebe then notsosubtly hints the friendship has the potential to become something more before

Apr 2 2024,neutral,from a radioactive roar in 2014 to atomically terrible breath in 2024 the monsterverse is getting long in the decaying tooth
Apr 2 2024,negative, godzilla x kong is an entertaining way to pass two hours yet its poor script and lack of character development stop it from being truly great since godzilla hit theaters in 2014 each installment has promised to be bigger and better than the last with more carnage more monsters and more uncharted territory godzilla x kong sees the two titular beasts put their past battles behind them joining forces to defeat a colossal undiscovered threat hidden within our world with action aplenty and visually pleasing worldbuilding godzilla x kong is an entertaining way to pass two hours yet its poor script and lack of character development stop it from being truly great seeing these monsters battle it out is an undeniably fun shlock fest godzilla x kongs issue is that it takes too long to get there with new characters to meet new territory to discover and new threats to understand the danger of theres a lot of exposition a very small amount of which is entertaining  it unfortunately reduces itself to handholding the first two acts of this movie are a mixture of drab dialogue cringeworthy jokes and underdevelopment of its characters the performances behind our human characters are good especially from leading lady rebecca hall and her onscreen daughter kaylee hottle but we still dont get a deep enough dive into their characters as we should there is an interesting arc for hottles character jia as she struggles to find her place in the world and goes on a journey of selfdiscovery but its unfortunately rushed over talented actors brian tyree henry and dan stevens are reduced to corny unfunny jokes this franchise has always failed to do its human characters justice and unfortunately godzilla x kong is not exempt from this the majority of the runtime is spent in hollow earth which is both a blessing and a curse on one hand the visuals are utterly stunning from start to finish with terrific worldbuilding and plenty of exciting new territory to explore each frame is packed with color and life with luscious green landscapes enticing waterfalls and electric pinks and blues that pop off the screen the filmmakers paid attention to the visuals and it pays off  its astonishing to look at there is an awful lot of cgi but its hard to balk when it looks this good there are also plenty of beasts outside of our titular two both on land and in the sky helping to bring hollow earth to life its a fantasy world thats fun to enter allowing you to make discoveries along the way alongside our characters fans of the franchise will enjoy meeting the monsters godzilla x kong has on offer the one issue with the hollow earth setting is that our monsters fit tidily into it its a large world fit for our large characters the most entertaining thing about godzilla kong and the rest of these beasts is that theyre absolutely huge  this is what provides the shock factor and makes it stand out we can gauge their scope when theyre in our world stepping over buildings crushing cars and headbutting bridges however this element gets lost within hollow earth  they almost become regular animals judging the character development and depth of the script seems futile when audiences are here for one thing only the action when our beasts are battling it out godzilla x kong is an entertaining crowdpleasing ride never taking itself too seriously it understands the dumb fun that can be had within this world and it certainly delivers on the shlock and carnage kong is front and center here and there are plenty of unearthly villains for him to take down even before the climax begins making friends with a young kong along the way the pair make for an entertaining and sweet dynamic duo godzilla might be more underutilized than wed expect but once hes back up and running hes as menacing as ever the radiation running through him makes him look very cool its hard not to grin when hes in action atomic breath and all it was incredibly entertaining to see godzilla and kong battle it out in 2021s addition to the franchise and its equally as fun to see them join forces here to fight others theres some humor injected into the final battle sequence as the two become an unstoppable tag team using wwe moves whilst helping each other to defeat their nemesis godzilla x kong is the epitome of a popcorn flick whilst not providing much in the way of characters depth or storyline it makes up for it with entertaining action and dumb yet fun fight sequences the script is bad with too many jokes that fall flat and plenty of missed opportunities in the way of theme exploration talent is wasted the tryhard needle drops dont fit the expositionheavy scenes are uninteresting and unnecessary and the story is more convoluted than it needs to be once our monsters are in fight mode its incredibly entertaining and becomes worth the viewing  its just a shame it takes too long to get there the only consistently good trait is the visuals  it always

Apr 2 2024,negative,director adam wingard tries but cant make the action mayhem hold our attention its never more than pointless carnage and the filmmaking blithely ignores the millions of humans who perish in all of this fullon destruction
Apr 2 2024,positive, in this new installment of the godzilla and king kong cinematic universe humans and mighty titans coexist  mostly  harmoniously but when an unidentified signal causes the creatures to experience hallucinations the fragility of this relationship is pushed to the forefront erupting in a series of wild battles true to the franchise film critic reggie the reel critic ponder noted godzilla and kong movies need to look good to keep viewers engaged and the exceptional use of cgi throughout this film made it easy to suspend his disbelief  the film is the 38th to emerge from the godzilla franchise and the 13th from king kong godzilla x kong the new empire follows godzilla x kong 2021 resuming after kong defeats mechagodzilla and establishes dominance over hollow earth it stars rebecca hall kaylee hottle and brian tyree henry
Apr 2 2024,positive, godzilla x kong the new empire takes place a few years after the events that unfolded in its prequel godzilla vs kong as kong adapts to the strange and overall upsidedownness of hollow earth while godzilla battles the titans above ground but how does the whole film adapt youre possibly wondering the sole surviving member of the iwi tribe jia kaylee hottle is a deaf teenager struggling to adapt to everyday life she can communicate with kong through sign language and is starting to get strange visions and distress signals from hollow earth her adopted mother dr ilene andrews rebecca hall feels like she doesnt understand her daughter meanwhile kong finds a new ape civilization but also a new threat in the form of the skar king  a titan lankier than kong and with an appearance similar to that of an orangutan or chimpanzee he carries a whip made of a spinal column with a crystal at the end of it that he uses to control an icebased titan called shimo as godzilla begins absorbing radiation from all possible sources humanitys only hope of survival is another teamup of the two giant enemies turned infrequent allies in giant monster films like this the storyline involving the humans always feels secondary and the acting and the dialogue are also usually on the unbearable side unfortunately godzilla x kong religiously follows this formula  for instance jia kaylee hottle always has this furrowed brow to accompany a halfhearted scowl she has the facial expression of someone who stepped in a pile of dog crap barefoot but didnt have time to wash her feet before putting on socks and shoes her mother rubs off on her a little being a scientist youd think dr andrews was at least somewhat intelligent but shes a borderline idiot she ignores blatant story points because shes too busy wondering if her daughter will return home with her after godzilla and kong put the kibosh on skar king  this is somewhat of a spoiler but dr andrews sees jia with some of the iwi running through the forest doing the laziest form of ribbon dancing youve ever seen and thinks wow she really belongs here other human characters are just as bad brian tyree henry returns as the rambling podcaster bernie hayes bernie is helpful for one central story point but his unbearable demeanor is passed off as the main comedic relief for the rest of the movie dan stevens is the closest thing to entertaining amongst the human characters stevens plays trapper a veterinarian specializing in gigantic monsters and hollow earth creatures his charisma and onscreen presence are amusing but his dialogue and everyone elses for that matter is atrocious godzilla x kong is a kong movie his hollow earth adventure is much more interesting than godzillas absorbed radiation and waittobeneeded approach however godzilla sleeping like a cat in an abandoned coliseum in italy is fantastic theres been a rumor that a son of kong film could be in the works and that could certainly be a possibility after the introduction of the juvenile ape titan suko  suko is an obnoxious brat who eventually realizes that kong is awesome and starts helping him out sukos highlight is when kong starts swinging him around as a weapon during a fight  because who hasnt dreamt of using a misbehaving toddler as a pair of nunchucks the films best part isnt as epic as it should be all of the titan action is the highlight but the special effects are often pretty wonky the cgi struggles between having decent detail and looking blobby rushed and not 135 million budgetworthy if and when another monsterverse movie gets greenlit you can visualize opportunities for kong hollow earth is this surreal and vast new world that audiences have barely seen the monsterverse version of kong is also awesome  godzilla doesnt have anything to do in future installments so i suggest that he goes to space to fight spacegodzilla while kong battles new enemies in hollow earth it feels like godzilla gets the short end of the stick more and more since king of the monsters godzilla x kong is like eating too much of your favorite candy and almost throwing up because of the stomach ache it gives you kong and godzilla have never been more fabulous kongs power glove and pink godzilla are spectacular and that antigravity sequence where kong rides godzilla all too briefly is incredible sadly with its horrid dialogue alltoosimplistic story human characters who deserve to be mercilessly stomped or chewed on and rough cgi godzilla x kong is the definition of a lousy movie turned guilty pleasure that despite its flaws possesses some epic moments smashing and bashing their way into kaiju royalty
Apr 2 2024,neutral, reviewed by dennis schwartzadam wingard death notethe guest directs this overloaded special effects sequel to the 2020s godzilla vs kong which is not better or worse than the others in the monsterverse franchise this being the fifth entry while kong and godzilla must have made at least 50 filmsthe nonsensical script is written by three writersterry rossio simon barrett and jeremy slater who provide set pieces nonstop fighting among the giant creatures and gives us a brainless but fun conclusion of the featured giant foes teaming up to fight a threatening giant monsterit opens with a lonely king kong residing beneath the earths surface at hollow earth the center of the planet while kongs foe godzilla after smashingup rome takes a snooze in the roman colosseumthe job of tracking godzilla around the world and kong at hollow earth goes to the scientist dr andrews rebecca hall things are going well in the world when kong and godzilla are kept apart but theres no such luck that the peace between them will last trouble arises when the brutish giant ape skar king is discovered in hollow earth as the leader of kongs missing family of apes the evil ape threatens the world and neither kong or godzilla can fight him alonesensing trouble brewing in hollow earth dr andrews assembles her peacekeeper team to look in on kong at his residence the team includes kongs kaijuhandling veteran dentist trapper dan stevens and the conspiracy theory podcaster bernie hayes brian tyree henry the team uncover that kong and godzilla are to join forces against their common enemy skar kingthe science teams purpose seems to be to clear up details for the viewer in the lightweight story by spewing pseudoscience nonsense and giving us comic relief when they verbally spar with each otherthe subplot tells of andrews adopted deaf daughter jia kaylee hottle the sole iwi tribe survivor on skull island use her telepathic ability to connect to the lost tribe at hollow earth she also uses sign language to communicate with kong wingard in his second monsterverse pic is ok at using his big budget for the set designs visuals and the cgis needed for the many titan fight scenesthe escapist film however makes no sense and it failed to get me to care for any of the giant monsters or human characters its a forgettable bfilm with a giant budget and a small story but if youre into seeing giant monsters fight or destroy cities around the world this film has the spectacle to deliver the goods
Apr 1 2024,negative, there is rarely a good time for godzilla to show up but the monsterverse version of him could not have picked a worse moment to rampage again godzilla x kong the new empire the fifth entry in legendary picturess slate of movies featuring lumbering kaiju and dubious continuity arrives just weeks after japans godzilla minus one concluded its impressive boxoffice run in the states that film made using a paltryforablockbuster budget of 15 million took home an oscar for best visual effects and proved that audiences had a taste for a fresh spin on the godzilla story maybe creatures like him could do more than merely stomp around and roar a bunch too bad the monsterverse movies prefer the stomping and roaring to actual storytelling the films after 2014s godzilla and 2017s kong skull island established the franchises stars have morphed into exercises in cgi monstermashing the truth is that pure spectacle has kept me on board even as the sequels have become awfully hard to defend as actual movies ive been genuinely impressed by the expressive creature design and layered sound work the monsters screams often make me feel like my bones are rattling these films may be emptytheres no message or meaning to think aboutbut they can be strangely stimulating godzilla x kong the new empire however is the monsterverse at its weakest its spectacle is even duller than its story which is already nonsensical the film promises that the two titular monsters will team upthough by using x instead of an ampersand it hints at an enemiestolovers beastly romance alas the plot does not go there nor do godzilla and kong spend much time onscreen together at all they are meant to unite to defeat a kongsize ape named the skar king but for most of the movie godzilla is on the surface of earth gathering more energy because he senses a threat while kong remains in hollow earth the mysterious realm at the planets core in which he investigates the origins of this new simian foe the film becomes only more frustrating to watch as the creatures get sidetracked facing off against lesser adversaries many of these set pieces pale in comparison to previous ones in the franchise when godzilla faces off against a swarm of drones the brawl doesnt feel suspenseful the way the similarly staged helicopter scene in kong skull island did when kong fights the skar kings henchmen henchapes he lacks the feral energy he had tearing apart hollow earths winged predators in godzilla vs kong the film also repeatedly avoids portraying encounters it spends ample time teasing in one scene godzilla heads to the arctic ocean and threatens a sea serpent with bioluminescent fins that emit a neonpink glow hell yeah but just as the two start snapping at each other the movie cuts away to the ocean surface where the serpents severed body emerges the battles over before its begun leaving the audience with none of the dizzying fun that comes from watching giant monsters clash these movies at their best evoke the juvenile energy of chucking action figures at each other making them fight new empire plays like an annoyingly strict babysitter cleaning up the toys before anything wild happens five movies in the franchise has clearly begun to run out of ideas for new antagonists and combat arenas hollow earth for all its iridescent landscapes has become less breathtaking the more its been seen one character calls it a nightmare monster hellscape but the animated nature of the place only makes its denizens seem more fake when godzilla and kong tore through hong kong in godzilla vs kong they were somewhat scary the scale of the buildings emphasizing their gargantuan size hollow earth serves as the setting for the bulk of new empire including its climax but inside it both monsters appear to be average beasts no amount of wideeyed looks on the part of actors too talented for these filmsincluding rebecca hall brian tyree henry and a lively dan stevens as a titan veterinarianmakes what happens exciting still the film does offer a glimmer of something different from the silliness its been peddling its dialoguefree opening sequence features an afternoon in the life of kong and rather delightfully captures why the character has been a movie star for so long his personality is as dramatic and compelling as his size threatened by a pack of predators kong scares them off by ripping one of them apart over his head and seems disgusted when he gets drenched in the corpses green blood he goes for a rinse under a waterfall then sits in his cave looking out with a solemn slightly indignant expression as he tends to a toothache later on earths surface godzilla too takes a break after destroying much of rome he curls up for a nap in the middle of the colosseum ignoring the helicopters spying on his every move the monsterverse has turned them into vessels for delivering headspinning visual effects and earsplitting sound but new empire suggests these two do have rich interior liveswe just dont really get to see them in 2014 the humans insisted on having titans fight perhaps its time to let them rest
Apr 1 2024,negative, both mothers to a beloved son they drink and smoke and moan about their husbands together all in the most beautiful skin tight designer dresses and high heels worn while vacuuming the house and attending to the garden and it is while pruning the roses alice witnesses the horrifying death of her besties young son falling from the balcony of her dear neighbours house alice quickly makes it all about her claiming her former best mate wont hang out with her any more something i had very little sympathy for as she parades her living son around in front of her neighbour so the set up is two women both who have well issues and only one son living between the two and you dont know who the baddie is  or even if there is one at all while the dresses are to die for neither character seems capable of breaking more than a nail without taking to their bed theyre not believable psychopaths fancy feeling as though your brain has been put in a washing machine for nearly two hours then this new instalment from the monsterverse might be the film for you they have the brute force and power to do it but not before kong comes back to normal earth from hollow earth where he now lives dr ilene andrews rebecca hall needs to find kong so along with scaredycat bernie brian tyree henry hyperactive trapper dan stevens and her adopted daughter jia kaylee hottle shes off on a search in the dangerous hollow earth  they need to reunite kong with godzilla so they can save humanity  while crushing most of it under their humongous feet in the overlong cgi fight sequences the script is so nonsensical with the cast delivering the lines with less care than they would a pizza based on 2013 novel a marker to measure drift jacquelines horrific trauma of the violence to her family is played out in flashbacks and told to american tour guide callie alia shawkat she sees more than most would in jacqueline making their friendship instantly valuable erivos presence is commanding her face and manner changing beyond recognition between her time in london to the homeless woman in greece but it is mostly the gentle lapping of the sea that you hear more than dialogue in this deeply sensitive film where a little too much is left unsaid
Apr 1 2024,negative,by the time we get to the climatic desert battle smashing the pyramids theres no impact left this is a repetitive series of chest thumping monsters shrieking cgi familiar characters a thin plot using impressive sound design with lots of campy music

Apr 1 2024,negative, the easiest reviews to write are for films that are either really good or really bad adam wingards epic action feature godzilla x kong the new empire is going to be a tough one starting significantly long after wingards godzilla vs kong the world is at relative peace kong has been exiled to hollow earth in search of anyone or anything who is like him his only connections to the surface world are dr ilene andrews rebecca hall and little jia kaylee hottle the last surviving member of the iwi tribe and someone with a psychic connection with kong ilene and jia are adoptive mother and daughter but jia feels out of place in this world with only ilene and kong as her family meanwhile godzilla has established his nest at the roman coliseum and heads out to dispatch any kaiju threatening to cause trouble but something sinister is lurking of gigantic proportions seismic tremors vibrate across the earth and somehow jia is the only person who can figure it out the mystery lies somewhere in hollow earth and ilene jia kaiju dentist trapper dan stevens pilot mikael alex ferns and youtuberhero of the previous film bernie brian tyree henry are sent to follow kong to solve the mystery their search uncovers a land of kongs a godzillalike threat and a mysticism that controls gravity on earth can godzilla and kong put their differences aside to save the worldwith minimal casualties yes and no the best thing i can say about godzilla x kong the new empire is that the film only lasts 110 minutes and it feels like you get more story than one can squeeze into this runtime with that bland is the best word to describe this movie as the brave intelligent dr ilene andrews rebecca hall brings almost nothing to the role other than being a single mother whos really smart kaylee hottle is jia who doesnt speak and looks lovingly at kong which sums up her character at least trapper and bernie each have an ounce of personality suffice it to say the human stuff is boring heres a tip for screenwriters its best not to spoil your movie halfway through there is a scene where our heroes lay out the plan for defeating the main lousy kaiju do this this and this well they do this this and this and the world is saved classic pixar would do the same thing but nothing would ever go to plan which is why classic pixar is considered classic the most significant crime of godzilla x kong the new empire is that it suffers the same fate as fast and the furious its a photorealistic computeranimated movie the animation of kong godzilla and the other kongs is mediocre at best the backgrounds should look photorealistic but they dont id rather watch dudes in suits duke it out over a cardboard city than watch this cartoon mess again what a regression of the story compared to godzilla minus one i feel like hollywood doesnt want to try anymore if you want to see a good kong movie go see the primevals hell try to see godzilla minus one again when you can now we wait for planet of the apes oh joy returning to our series on the cinematic history of kaiju monsters toho studios brings us the giant monster battle king kong vs godzilla did toho catch now in theaters i mean the formula is simple when you reboot a beloved franchise modernize the effects and production but keep the heart of the marking the fiveyear return of the lovable godzilla is godzilla king of the monsters his return is a direct sequel to the 2014s godzilla and film threat cares about your privacy and the security of your information visit our full length privacy policy to get informed on our policies regarding the collection use and disclosure of information we receive from users
Apr 1 2024,positive, this prologue is going to take a bit so stay with me the one attribute that japanese godzilla fans will always have over american ones is that theyre significantly more looseygoosey with the often highly variable portrayals of the king of the monsters onscreen is he an expression of japans fears and the memory of cultural traumas the atomic bombings fukushima etc yeah is he a goofy planetprotector with many silly friends and a weird little trollson fighting against creatures from planet x yeah is he cuddly enough that a japanese tv show literally did an entire segment in which they granted a teenage girl her wish  to go on a date with godzilla oh you bet hes a cultural figure with many thematic applications and tonal variability which is why western audiences struggle so much with him  deprived of the original message of ishiro hondas work thanks to selfimposed censorship by the importing studios and we learned only after we headed into the campy joy of the showa era free from raymond burr interference at american driveins of the original fables profundity now there will always be purists but one would think this would have led western audiences to a similar acceptance of the characters pliability yet we seem only able to tolerate different perspectives if theyre not the dominant ones at the multiplex cornball re fun shit struggles to coexist with the serious perhaps its because of our selfidentification with our media  godzilla is a part of japanese culture but hes not the totality of it  or that hes primarily limited to one medium rather than having to compete with different ideations of himself in the pages of shonen jump joel schumacher made campy fun gay batman movies and comic book nerds hated him so much for it that they spent the better part of a decade infecting all of culture with grittiness in an effort for people to try and take their shit seriously or its because were still ashamed about how badly we fucked up our first attempt back in 98 or that cloverfield beat legendary to the punch when it came to making the franchise relevant again when the conditions were pretty much primed for it a decade later when gareth edwards godzilla arrived in 2014 it marked the first real western project to use the character as originally intended  cultural fears metastasized into a giant lizard creature whose wanton destruction is infinitely more preferable to the focused destruction of the other monsters out there  and singlehandedly fucked everything up for whoever had to follow that up with a real sequel king of the monsters assumed that famous faces heaps of melodrama and a sprinkling of first reformed apocalyptic ennui would be able to sustain the movie while the four monsters at its core werent duking it out and it was about as wrong as one could get the legwork hadnt been done to build up any of these characters or any of the monsters not named godzilla or ghidorah  in essence it was a sacrifice bunt meant to advance another runner to second that runner was kong who got a highlysilly monsterverse debut in 2017 when half the mcu headed to skull island and whose presence set up the inevitable west vs east showdown in 2021 we all knew godzilla would win that fight in a heartbeat but what people didnt expect was that it would be one of the trueblue hits of the pandemic era raking in dough handoverfist at the meager covid box office making 30 million opening weekend with half of the damn theaters in the country closed and the film being simultaneously dropped for free on a streaming service is an accomplishment so when godzilla x kong the new empire was announced there was plenty of unearned skepticism about its prospects and now were in the present thank you for your patience heres the outandout hottake that youve been waiting for adam wingard is the strongest franchiseminded filmmaker that has ever worked within these parameters and the bleating of people like me but not as attractive online doesnt change the fact that audiences are responding to his work with the character sure we may be in a strike drought when it comes to new releases but this thing  a fourth sequel with a quarter of the stars of the second in the cast a noname villain essentially retreading the premise of the last movie and its an easterweekend release  is outperforming gareth edwards juggernaut at thursday night previews you can only handwave away the differences so much and god help you if you bring up fucking inflation  the proof will come in the receipts and regardless of its quality wingard is doing something to make western audiences interested in a domestic blend of a cultural import my explanation for this is that wingard who trained in horror and genre and who has made masterpieces youre next the guest and flailing failures blair witch death note fundamentally understands how to reach a plurality of his audience in a way not seen since the early days of the marvel cinematic universe the average person who likes seeing a big lizard and a big gorilla hit each other real hard will be entertained the child who is astonished by citywide carnage will be entertained the nerd motherfucker saying the word kaiju in the year of our lord two thousand and twentyfour will not cop to it but he will be entertained at least in some part of his soul even if hell find some way to screech about godzilla minus ones oscar win to everyone in shouting distance in the lobby afterward the question is ultimately why has wingard succeeded where others have failed there are several possible answers but chief among them is that he has a proper nonhuman protagonist one that exists as a counter to the sheerforceofmysterious nature that is godzilla while preserving the kings ambiguities kongs value to these movies is absurdly underrated  hes the lone monster excuse me titan who can emote which makes him an emotionally resonant asset but hes also in this interpretation full of enough wit and guile to make up for what he lacks in strength i remember people dunking on wingards approach when he compared kong to john mcclane but its true  when youre a bigass ape trying to land a tko punch on a nuclear lizards jaw its going to take every bit of the range of motion that those opposable thumbs give you to overcome that massive disadvantage but hes also just more openly relatable  wingards perspective on godzilla is that hes essentially a gigantic cat rousing from his bed the coliseum in rome to take care of mice giant spider creatures and such when they get too close to his nest  so watching him suffer through a toothache or scratch his ass or whatever is just close enough to our perspective that we feel close enough to him besides all the guy wants is to find a family and thats where the emotional fulcrum of new empires story the only problem is that that lost family hidden in yet another hollow earth within the hollow earth itself is under the rule of a tyrannical despot who has managed to find himself a means to control one of the most powerful monsters glimpsed on screen yet so kong godzilla and an unnamed third monster have to team up in order to cut this guy down to size you may have noticed i havent mentioned the human characters primarily because theyve never been more irrelevant in the monsterverses scheme of things if you want mild human drama apple tvs monarch has you covered but new empire is wisely focused on the widescreen possibilities of its conflict thats not to say the cast is bad  any ensemble with rebecca hall bryan tyree henry and dan stevens doing his ace ventura best is a pretty solid one  but theyre fundamentally filler in a way that doesnt dominate the feature like it did in king of the monsters or how people think it does with the edwards godzilla ill put up with dogshit dialogue for that perspective any day of the week folks theyre supporting roles and although the western takes on these movies have never really figured out that they can be swell color commentators their main purpose is to enable our giant monsters to punch each other so what you get is actionpacked fun that refuses to steep to spielbergian profundity in an attempt to try and be something it is incapable of being serious once a second monster comes into the mix you have transcended the original limitations of the parable and stepped firmly into the ridiculous and wingard understands and embraces that this isnt a turn off your brain movie or whatever its just aiming for a different pleasure center  the kind that gets you jacked up when say a wrestler pulls off a plastic sting mask to reveal that it is in fact sting in full facepaint beneath the mask its clever and rewarding in a way that audiences can quantify but which can elude people who spend too much talking about the number of acts in a given story structure for a film like this three acts five acts eight acts oh sorry no one was paying attention  the rest of the world was paying attention to the radioactive dinosaur bodyslamming a giant ape into one of the pyramids of giza please dont think im dismissing intellectual endeavor here  lots of fantastic scholarship has been written about these films but it typically comes after the fact once the thrills have faded and culture has moved on to the next shiny blockbuster on the calendar indeed this defense understands and acknowledges the frivolous nature of this type of entertainment but is that frivolity really a bad thing the spirit of the showa era in the godzilla canon was one of tightly budgeted excess in which the way forward was through increased absurdity  a testament to the cultural creativity of the japanese in an era in which in the aftermath of atrocities perpetuated by and against them they forged a new national imagination through boundless creativity a national icon of nuclear terror and a proverbial horseman of death tormenting a rebuilding nation for their sins becomes a guardian of the earth with an array of colorful pals at his side and an entire island to house them like a big ol happy family the heisei era offers another perspective for japanese audiences transforming the character for a rebuilt japan but those original stories became meaningful enough to people worldwide that he became an icon cartoons comics even squaring up against charles barkley in the 90s for a nike ad before getting paid the highest compliment a terrible american remake this is wingards true accomplishment he is the lone western filmmaker who tries to synthesize all of these eras into one specific international entertainment without any given element overwhelming the rest and his two films in this universe succeed at evoking that sustained creativity that is where the franchise gets its reputation for fun there should be no guilt in indulging in these pleasures because the puritan notion of edificationthroughart is a functionally conservative one that wholly omits aesthetics and to deny new empires successes at crowdrousing is to ignore the hum of delight emerging from a latenight crowd as they watch a minivansized tooth sail through the streets of rio or the laughter that follows when kong smirks at the giant apeman whose mouth hes just knocked it out of this may not be the best american godzilla film or anywhere close to the best kong but it is certainly the best evocation of the toho spirit to emerge from these shores 
Apr 1 2024,positive, there is absolutely no need for any humans in godzilla x kong the new empire if they were taken out along with any spoken language this movie would still work as a riproaring sillyfaced good time thats because when it comes to monster movies no one actually cares about the people we want spectacle and gargantuan beasts and this movie definitely delivers on the latter its the latest entry in legendary pictures monsterverse which is somehow holding strong while its fellow universes over at the mcu and dceu need serious tinkering it helps that the headliners are two movie brands that keep adjusting to every new decade godzilla and king kong rematch but its not a repeat of their last standoff 2021s godzilla vs kong this one goes fully camp while expanding the fight leaving the humans with even less dimension than the monsters in the aftermath of the events from the last movie kong is still running and munching through hollow earth that trippy other world in our planets interior the gorilla titan is also suffering from a toothache keeping track and care of kong is monarch scientist ilene andrews rebecca hall who remains an adoptive mother to jia kaylee hottle now nearing adolescence but still linked to kong something is going on when godzilla emerges once more from the ocean depths this time stomping through rome apparently in search of great energy for a coming showdown there is a strange distress signal coming out of hollow earth and detected by jia when ilene and jia reunite with conspiracy podcaster and titan expert bernie hayes brian tyree henry they follow kong back into hollow earth accompanied by titan veterinarian trapper dan stevens what they find is an unexplored corner of the place along with a hidden civilization and a looming monstrous threat preparing to attack the surface out of the monsterverse output godzilla x kong is the title that falls most into the clichés viewers tend to associate with kaiju movies meaning it is a lot of logicdefying beast action where people are reduced to screaming bystanders this was always ironic considering the first ever godzilla from 1954 remains a sharp allegory for the dangers of nuclear weapons and the psychological toll of hiroshima on japan the atomic lizards home country has kept this richer storytelling tradition going as seen in last years oscarwinning godzilla minus one the first monsterverse movies gareth edwards 2014 godzilla and jordan vogtrobertss 2017 kong skull island were both unique and inventive director adam wingard is back after having made godzilla vs kong with trippy adventure and cornball yet convincing human angles godzilla x kong is the lesser but still retains a sense of selfreferential humor this time going for broke with overthetop absurdity that never sits still sly gags work like kong needing to get an infected tooth pulled by trapper this might be a reference to 1986s king kong lives where the furry hero needed a heart transplant godzilla has also decided his prime napping spot is the colosseum in rome theres not much to say about the humans so its best to get that part out of the way before going into the movies truly wild moments ilene and team are thrown into a bare bones plot that jumps around in spurts as the movie tries to stay focused on the massive beasts essentially the humans are here to just explain what the story itself is it turns out there are two new big discoveries in hollow earth first the iwi led by a queen fala chen worship the luminous titan mothra and have their own special connection to jia second the big villain is another giant ape the scar king who plans a savage invasion of the surface with his chained titan servant shimo godzilla fans know this as another giant lizard which happens to emit a deadly frost quite literally the only task at hand for the humans is to stand around hilltops yelling who is who or decipher some cave carvings to explain why there should be a showdown between the scar king and everyone else the screenplay by terry rossio simon barrett and jeremy slater features dialogue thats all exposition theres much more character development with a small ape who befriends kong and becomes his protégé for audience members walking in just wanting to see wellmade cgi monstrosities shake the walls in dolby surround sound the real movie kicks off when godzilla and kong throw down with the scar king and shimo what these monsterverse movies have always had going for them even above marvel at times is their genuine visual scale the special effects never look boring and here we still get some epic popcorn sites kong battling hollow earth canines chomping on some giant sea critter or godzilla demolishing rome before sucking radiation out of a nuclear power plant somewhere else are deliriously entertaining on their own the scar king inhabits a lair with cascades of lava snarling orders we dont need translated because his menacing rictus is enough climactic battles pound all over cairo and são paulo with little concern for the safety of historic landmarks no one seems to comment on how the pyramids of giza get pretty smashed up but thats the tradition of kaiju flicks nobody watches gamera guardian of the universe wondering about who will pay for all the damages in tokyo godzilla gets less extended screen time than kong this time around but once he powers up and starts to glow he matches his foeturnedbuddy in the ensuing stompathon great cinema this is not it iis not even one of the better monsterverse movies but if your sole aim is to see kaiju heavy metal onscreen godzilla x kong will work as enjoyably bad because the editing and visuals still have scope playing around with the idea of size and perception this movie also retains some inventiveness when we see kong and the scar king face off surrounded by the villains other ape goons everything looks of equal size once they are seen by the humans we are reminded they are giants by comparison that is still fun in a classic saturday morning cartoon way still one hopes the next movie finds a better balance between all the players involved large and small the previous monsterverse movies featured genuine human villains representing corporate greed or the dangers of playing god much of these godzillakong moments almost work like a silent movie the people become the equivalent of intrusive subtitles a better balance will mean we can be engaged beyond just the earthshaking roars
Apr 1 2024,positive, although both of the main characters have their origins in film rather than printed matter godzilla x kong the new empire feels more like an oldschool mainstream comic book than most movie releases from marvel or dc the good guys are very good the bad guys are very bad warnings on computer systems frequently have double exclamation points and should an unfamiliar language need translation one of the characters can always exhibit previously unmentioned telepathic abilities regarding fellow humans godzilla x kong the new empire is the latest in the series of interlinked movies that began with 2014s godzilla and continues through 2017s kong skull island 2019s godzilla king of the monsters and 2021s godzilla vs kong as well as the 20232024 apple tv miniseries monarch legacy of monsters summarizing the details would take forever so here are the basics godzilla has turned out to be one of a number of giant creatures called titans inhabiting the earth while he doesnt interact with humans and has no respect for real estate godzilla will sometimes defend humanity against more hostile titans as a giant gorilla kong is fonder of people especially young deaf jia kaylee hottle like kong jia hails from skull island she is the last known survivor of the iwi tribe in godzilla vs kong kong and jia bonded via sign language at the end of godzilla vs kong the big lizard and the big ape teamed up to take down mecha godzilla godzilla then went back to the ocean depths while kong took off to explore the undergroundalternate dimensionsomeplacenothere of hollow earth to search for more of his kind this is where were all at when godzilla x kong begins kong is continuing to look for other giant gorillas jias adoptive mother dr ilene andrews rebecca hall is one of the head scientists at monarch the organization thats been studying the various titan creatures since the 1950s when there seems to be trouble in hollow earth ilene jia eccentric but brilliant podcaster bernie hayes brian tyree henry also back from godzilla vs kong and megaveterinarian trapper dan stevens new to the franchise all go there to find out whats wrong at the same time that something seems to be bothering godzilla topside although godzilla is first in the title this is really kongs show he gets to emote reflect grow as an individual and even go on a hairy heros journey its a real shame the motioncapture performer is not prominently credited godzilla is there mainly to serve as punctuation whenever pacing dictates that city sections have gone unstomped for too long and of course for the climactic battle director adam wingard back for a second goround after vs devised the story with terry rossio  simon barrett rossio is credited with the screenplay along with barrett and jeremy slater they all keep things moving at a good speed although wingard and the vfx team have proportional problems with one new character whose size in relation to his surroundings is frankly confusing we do wonder why the previously waterdwelling godzilla is showing a taste for napping in the hot sun here which is not addressed it might be less of an issue of the movie were less sincerely geeky but here it seems like something that would worry the monarch scientists and appears to be more for visual value than story coherence we see lots of different monsters which are enjoyable it must be said that the primary villain here is a bit underwhelming especially after the formidable king ghidora in godzilla king of the monsters and the gloriously absurd mechagodzilla in godzilla vs kong still godzilla x kong proceeds pretty much as it feels like it should we also get a lot of joy from the actors who are all energetic and ready to set up andor deliver punchlines with verve its especially pleasing to see young hottle who is deaf and indigenous hold center screen with such poise godzilla x kong the new empire has a sincere commitment to its tone which is being huge and playful without winking directly at us its straightfaced dumb fun
Apr 1 2024,negative, amid the somewhat convoluted story is a theme of teamwork as the monsters must learn to trust one another and work together to defeat a greater evil story also shows importance of stepping up and offering your personal skills and services when needed while the humans must chip in and offer their personal skills and services characters are pretty shallow and tend to contradict themselves eg dr andrews at first wonders about the possibilities of the new subterranean world but at other times believes things are impossible and bernie flips back and forth between being curious and excited about scientific possibility and behaving like a thirdrate comical coward human characters are diverse on the surface level though none are particularly well developed the main human character is a female doctor rebecca hall costar kaylee hottle comes from an alldeaf family her character jia communicates with her adoptive mother via american sign language asl podcaster bernie hayes is played by black actor brian tyree henry and chineseborn fala chen plays the iwi queen rachel house who comes from the māori people of new zealand plays an important member of dr andrews team asian australian actor ron smyck plays a member of the hollow earth outpost and black actor kevin copeland plays a submarine commander many more characters of color and women in smallerbackground roles dangerperil and giant monster fights with slamming punching choking etc godzilla blows up a crabtype monster and showers yellow goo everywhere kong eats chunks of the creatures hes killed in battle slurping stringy innards like spaghetti he also rips open a hyenatype monster corpse and showers green guts all over himself bloody claw prints human attacked and eaten by sentient tree roots outpost attacked dead body seen underneath wreckage kong takes a young ape by the foot and swings it around for use as a weapon in a fight kongs paw is sliced open by a sharp blade as well as frozen and injured by frostbite ape heads displayed on poles character has a brief angry rant about internet trolls infrequent uses of st ass hell  and damn and exclamatory use of god and oh my god character calls an internet troll a trash bag parents need to know that godzilla x kong the new empire is the fifth film in warner bros monsterverse series violence as expected is the main issue expect lots of giant monster fights with slamming punching and choking kong rips open a hyenatype monster corpse and showers green guts all over himself and slurps up the innards of the creatures hes killed in battle and godzilla blows up a crabtype monster and showers yellow goo everywhere kong also takes a young ape by the foot and swings it around for use as a weapon in a fight a sharp blade slices open kongs paw and a human is attacked and eaten by sentient tree roots a dead body is seen underneath wreckage language includes infrequent uses of st ass hell and damn as well as god and oh my god as exclamations theres no sex or substance use of note as usual the monsters have more personality than the humans and the story is too convoluted but the big boomy battles are fun to stay in the loop on more movies like this you can sign up for weekly family movie night emails in godzilla x kong the new empire peace has been established with kong living in the subterranean realm of hollow earth and godzilla roaming the surface world dr ilene andrews rebecca hall keeps tabs on them both while raising young jia kaylee hottle the last surviving iwi from skull island suddenly kong returns to the surface with a toothache and dr andrews calls in veterinarian trapper dan stevens to help meanwhile godzilla stirs and starts traveling the world absorbing enormous amounts of power dr andrews jia trapper monster podcaster bernie hayes brian tyree henry and pilot mikael alex ferns accompany kong back to hollow earth there kong finally discovers a tribe of apes like himself while the humans stumble upon evidence of an ancient civilization of iwi everything leads up to a major showdown against an evil ape leader to defeat him godzilla and kong must bury the hatchet and work together par for the course for the monsterverse series the monsters have more personality than the humans but at least watching them battle and smash things has some visceral entertainment value godzilla x kong the new empire has to find some way to get the two big guys to join forces and its a convoluted process with so many stepsincluding a chosen one and a prophecythat the humans are mostly just there as exposition machines who must keep explaining the plot every time the camera points at them as a result theyre reduced to familiar cardboard cutout types brian tyree henry has the hardest job whipping back and forth between being a nerd whos both excited about discovering all this monster stuff and a whimpering coward like something right out of an old abbott  costello movie that said the hollow earth design is truly gorgeous and the monster fights which include some new guest stars land with a concrete impact truthfully the computergenerated characters are so much better at telling the story with their wordless gestures and expressions that godzilla x kong the new empire might have been better without any humans in it at all but its biggest challenge may be that its being released just months after the oscarwinning godzilla minus one which was made for around a 10th of the cost of this one and is certainly 10 times better theres more to monster movies than smashing families can talk about godzilla x kong the new empires violence how did it make you feel was it exciting shocking what did the movie show or not show to achieve this effect why is that important the first japanese godzilla filmmakers used monster suits and miniatures to create their special effects not cgi if youve seen the 1954 original or its imitators which do you prefer lowtech practical effects or something more realistic and hightech which usually works better in movies common sense medias unbiased ratings are created by expert reviewers and arent influenced by the products creators or by any

Apr 1 2024,negative, i had no idea walking into godzilla x kong the new empire that i was about to sit through two hours of cgi brawling behemoths in a rock opera  ok its not explicitly a rock opera but its 80sinspired synthetic score and a handful of throwback hits set over irreverent action sequences give the film an added boost of energy that accounting for its flimsy premise and lackluster human character development is essential to keeping viewers awake its the marvel effect if youve seen thor ragnarok or any guardians of the galaxy film then youll understand why director adam wingard has taken the initiative to pump up the volume on his second film in this franchise  after all the law of cinematic attraction clearly states that any movie with a weak plot is made instantly more appealing when its video is overlayed with decadesold nostalgialaden audio there is an instant spray of pheromones pumped into the theater when godzilla and kong hit their stride pummeling their opponents to a kickin beat  godzilla and kong were pitted against one another in the last film this one opens in hollow earth a world below ours where kong lives without fear of attack from his nemesis godzilla who patrols the world above but kong is bored spinning his wheels with local battles until another crack in his subterranean home reveals yet another hidden universe godzilla ever the giant teddy bearhuman babysitter spends his days battling the previously released titans that threaten humanity until there is an abrupt change in his behavior he can sense a threat brewing and it takes his human keepers at monarch the secret multinational governmental unit tasked with studying the monsters an embarrassing amount of time to catch up godzilla and kong will be united against one adversary the scar king a deranged colossal orangutan who has been plotting to escape his subsubrealm to decimate the humans and live in the suns warmth rebecca hall returns as ilene andrews a scientist at monarch and adoptive mother to jia kaylee hottle the last person from the iwa tribe who were the ancient keepers of kong on skull island dan stevens stars as a comic relief rock n roll cowboy veterinarian and brian tyree henry returns as bernie the conspiracy theorist and podcaster who incredibly becomes dr andrews first line of defense when jia starts having eery premonitions of all the points at which audiences must suspend their disbelief in a film about skyscrapersized amphibians and apes there is no moment as incredible as when dr andrews casually agrees to allow bernie a civilian on her very classified mission to hollow earth its a small plot point but one that speaks volumes to the film as a whole godzilla x kong has no interest in manifesting any form of reality is this too much to ask of it should we only expect escapist entertainment perhaps releasing in the direct shadow of godzilla minus one which won an oscar for its visual effects does not help its cause godzilla x kong cannot be compared to the latter and isnt attempting to compete this is pure monsterverse fantasy the plot is a means to an end a mode of transport to watching our titular giants pulverize rio de janeiro and tailslap one another  its never been more clear that the liveaction characters are more hindrance than interest ancillary pests we are required to cut to every few scenes much of the films runtime is set in hollow earth a looking glass mutation of the upside down from stranger things a crossover of jurassic park and journey to the center of the earth if you saw the pixar flop strange world you could make a heavy argument that the oddities in hollow earth are moving body parts of a larger organism or some other silly twist above all it feels very derivative an unoriginal amalgamation of various other fictional worlds in our pop culture lexicon  there is some good and by good i mean something of interest to some viewers despite godzillas top billing kong is the feature here and hes a much fleshier sympathetic character than in the last film  his search for belonging  a mission parallel to jias who also discovers her own tribe in that mystical capsule of underthecrust space  garners the minimal amount of empathy and affinity a film would need to connect its viewer with its subject there are some new cute animal characters with enough expressive knowhow to give a generally mute population of monkey mutants a voice without words  overall however the overwhelming amount of cgi was like watching a strobe light in a mirrored room there is simply too much going on multiple generated monsters the many strange intricacies of hollow earth fastmoving cameras and quick action sequences it was a chore for my eyes to keep up  the film spends at least half its runtime in a cgicreated world following cgicreated characters and placing its liveaction characters against a green screen if i wanted to watch an animated feature id catch an encore of kung fu panda 4 the few interesting moments particularly the big tagteam finale that is the godzillakong versus scar king showdown is undermined by all the aforementioned inadequacies mothra a longtime superinsect in the godzilla universe makes a fluttery unremarkable appearance as a marketed savior if like me youre a nongodzillakong expert dont enter the theater expecting much more than some nifty fight sequences trapped in a hollow shell of a film
Apr 1 2024,neutral,while always nice to see some kaiju fisticuffs in the daylight and away from water the film still suffers anytime the humans are center stage even if none are to be found amongst the obvious casualties lowering the stakes considerably
Apr 1 2024,positive, godzilla x kong the new empire2021s godzilla vs kong began with bobby vintons over the mountain across the sea on the soundtrack as kong showered in a waterfall to start his day this new saga starts with jim reeves singing welcome to my world as the super simian lopes through his new home at the center of the earth things arent so bucolic for the big ape hes plagued with dental pain harassed by hideous creatures and assuming hes the last of his kind hes lonely meanwhile up on the earths surface godzilla is keeping busy he vanquishes a spidery lovecraftian nightmare in the streets of rome and then rather adorably he curls up to get some shuteye in the colosseum like its a catbed in other words this is the second american kaiju flick in a row that declines to take itself too seriously is it as good as last years startlingly sober japanese national rumination godzilla minus one not remotely is it even as good as godzilla vs kong probably not but its still plenty of fun kong plumbs an unexplored region of the hollow earth where he meets an endearing minikong and others of his own kind theyre enslaved by skar king a vicious ape dictator and his brutal goons kong understandably feels the need to act along for the ride are a few humans including rebecca hall returning as the kongologist from the previous film kaylee hottle as her beautiful painedlooking adopted daughter the last known skull islander brian tyree henry as the conspiracyminded podcaster and dan stevens as a cocksure kaiju veterinarian but the focus is less on humans here than even in the earlier films in the series as preposterous as godzilla x kong is its also genuinely and freewheelingly imaginative director adam wingard and his gaggle of coscreenwriters give us scenes of kong sauntering among the pyramids or mothra over rio or kong taking a bellyflop dive from the summit of gibraltar that seem to owe more to cheerful whimsy than to logical plotting still without too much straining one could even tease out an allegorical political subtext here its not hard to guess who the mangy patchy orangefurred king skar might symbolize but the source of his tyrannical power has a parallel too skar maintains his rule because he holds in bondage a huge spiky frostypale monster with freezy breath this behemoth started to remind me of a certain currently subjugated grand old party there was also something i liked about this movies ending it has one it doesnt have twenty when the dramatic arc has been satisfied godzilla x kong doesnt keep piling on extra codas as if panicky it hasnt given us enough it wraps things up in under two hours and gets out while the getting is good let it serve as an example to future big franchise movies
Mar 31 2024,positive,godzilla x kong the new empire for better or worse is a kids movie now this is a throwback to those goofy godzilla movies that we grew up with
Mar 31 2024,positive,wingard upscaling pure saturday morning cartoon energy to accommodate his bigscreen vision for chaos and destruction delivers all that as well as fullyearned if fleeting beats of wonder and emotion
Mar 31 2024,negative, we are living in a godzillaissance and godzilla x kong the new empire continues on the trend of resurrecting godzilla and kong as characters and monsters for a new generation of moviegoers the script is nothing more than exposition to buy time before the next cgi titan fight maybe thats all you are here for anyway i dunno much of this just feels like youre watching someone play a really loud and impressive video game of big beast go fight and smash after awhile with the stilted dialogue and uninteresting developments the popcorn and snacks only get you so far decembers oscarwinning godzilla minus one did more for the godzilla franchise in 15 minutes than this movie does to sustain any legacy other than someone saying godzilla x kong do they fight together are they in the same movie again didnt ghostbusters just make a movie with empire in the title a soulless empty endeavor full of cgi monsters beating the hell out of each other godzilla x kong the new empire spins its wheels in an effort to create a massive spectacle of mayhem and excitement well certainly we have mayhem not so much on the excitement partperhaps adam wingards new film suffers from the euphoria that surrounded godzilla minus one the oscarwinning stunner which made godzilla a villainous behemoth and immersed audiences into a parallel universe where the tension felt earned the visual effects beyond impressive on a limited 15 million budget and a cinematic experience that nicole kidman waxes poetic about in her amc theater adsin all seriousness though there are some nice moments in godzilla x kong this is a movie that simply uses exposition and surfacelevel storytelling as a means to get to godzilla battling massive beasts around the world and kong returning to hollow earth this is where our core group of four main characters make a number of new discoveries and continue their quest in attempting to understand kongs history the lineage of a young girl and how one character will amass enough audio and video footage for his blog and podcast this is a plot pointdo we even call things blogs in 2024 i digressfor those who may have missed 2021s godzilla vs kong which arrived during the pandemic and was released on hbo max and in theaters at the same time wingard catches us all up on what we may have missed the last go round thats helpful this allows us to dive right into the meat of the matter if you will kong is in hollow earth coexisting in a world that is both impressive and menacing while godzilla fights the mutant titans who seemingly try to destroy humankind after one such victory he curls up for a nap to sleep off the battle of course as one does he naps inside the colosseum however godzilla is also seemingly drawn to nuclear power plants and radiation sites hes powering up for something and scientists are at a loss meanwhile dr ilene andrews rebecca hall is made aware of strange behavior at school by her adopted daughter jia kaylee hottle jia is drawing patterns and appearing to black out or go into a trance of sorts while doing so concerned dr andrews remembers shes seen these patterns before and they relate to the iwi tribe jias lineal descendants who were defeated years beforeat this point it feels like maybe we have something  like screenwriters terry rossio jeremy slater and simon barrett are going to mix and match a compendium of subplots and create something that immerses us into this otherworld of adventure and mystery and i will say when impressive visual effects are the best thing this movie has going for it you best believe that hollow earth looks incredible the creatures and beasts and cgi is flawless and the film is impressively staged  a soulless empty endeavor full of cgi monsters beating the hell out of each other godzilla x kong the new empire spins its wheels in an effort to create a massive spectacle of mayhem and excitement well certainly we have mayhem not so much on the excitement part perhaps adam

hollow earth looks incredible the creatures and beasts and cgi is flawless and the film is impressively staged  but again this is soulless theres no there there while we end up with kong finding an eventual companion in a young ape named suko to eventually stay by his side and jia unlocking a major mystery in her tribal history the rest of the movie languishes the battles are predictable the melodrama never really connects in an emotional way and we end up watching computergenerated monsters participate in a makeshift monstermania look i love a good hoss fight as much as anyone even cgi ones but this cannot be all the movie offers and after awhile godzilla x kong becomes frustratingly simple and inert in terms of generating any excitement or providing the escapism the movie teasesinterestingly and certainly coincidental this is the second movie in subsequent movies to use empire in the title arriving on the heels of ghostbusters frozen empire both films feature monsters who can freeze anything in its path its too bad the ghostbusters couldnt have hitched a ride to help with the mission that andrews radical veterinarian trapper dan stevens and bumbling podcaster bernie brian tyree henry take up on behalf of earth and all its people at times i wondered what would happen if godzilla and kong and whatever they were up against just destroyed everything in its path i kind of want that movie a monstermania style destruction the likes of which we have never seen what would happen if these monsters many of which are dispatched way too easily actually had prolonged brawls to the death what would be left of earth what would be left of the human race then what who survives how does a world essentially run by the monsters who destroyed society as we know it adapt evolve and cultivate a futuremaybe someday we will have someone brave enough to make that movie until then we get things like this an increasingly boring godzilla x kong a new empire which squanders some of the good it generates for a series of exhausting cgi big battles which begs the questionisnt this what video games were made for while we end up with kong finding an eventual companion in a young ape named suko to eventually stay by his side and jia unlocking a major mystery in her tribal history the rest of the movie languishes the battles are predictable the melodrama

Mar 31 2024,negative, this sequel to the big monkey versus big lizard smackdown 2021s godzilla vs kong finds kong moping in hollow earth while godzilla listlessly lumbers around the surface world but it would take more than a geologically improbable parallel dimension to keep these two apart and returning director adam wingard ups the ante with yet more huge furious creatures rebecca hall as titan specialist ilene is mainly required to explain the plot between battle sequences brian tyree henry playing monsterblogger bernie provides incredulous doubletakes dan stevenss trapper brings hawaiian shirts and devilmaycare rashness to the mix dumbeddown and stripped of the symbolic subtext of the earlier movies the picture is not without seatshuddering thrills but its like a tagteam wrestling bout for monsters rather than a picture with meaning and even a modicum of thought
Mar 31 2024,negative, for several entries the series dubbed by warner brothers as the monsterverse has been declining into transformers territory godzilla x kong marks the point at which that dreaded barrelbottom has been reached a numbing excursion into cgi carnage the film does an adequate job of presenting monsteronmonster action while completely ignoring the human cost of for example a battle royale in and around rio de janeiro the christ the redeemer statue survives they same cant be said for the pyramids of giza in a separate fight theres a sense of diminishing returns in these american productions  a growing sameness to the action that swapping the participants cant change the best monsterverse battle todate remains the godzillaghidorah clash in king of the monsters  perhaps the greatest hurdle for this movie to overcome is the existence of godzilla minus one the best bigscreen godzilla excursion in years it reminds viewers what a real godzilla movie can be like godzilla x kong doesnt come close godzilla minus one has heart it has scope and most important of all the title creature engenders a sense of awe theres nothing of the sort in this fifth monsterverse chapter godzilla is still a little off and kong the king is never used is almost as big an imposter emphasis on big  hes ten times the size he was in 1933 as the sadsack version in tohos 1962 king kong vs godzilla  the story  if it can be called that  picks up a few years after the conclusion of godzilla vs kong kong has gone deep underground into his hollow earth home to look for others of his kind hes getting lonely and has developed a toothache meanwhile godzilla is running around on the surface occasionally causing upset such as when he decides to turn the coliseum in rome into a bed curled up like a cat he fills it up eventually it becomes apparent that kong is not alone in his milieu  there are a whole bunch of other giant gorillas ruled over by the cruel vicious skar king when kong challenges him for rule of the troop the skar king reveals his secret weapon shimo a captive ancient titan capable of controlling and channeling cold to defeat him kong must return to the surface and find a way to bring godzilla into hollow earth oh there are some humans running around as well they dont serve much purpose beyond providing exposition and occasionally moving the plot forward returning characters include ilene andrews rebecca hall a monarch scientist bernie hayes brian tyree henry a conspiracyloving podcaster and jia kaylee hottle the mute child with a special connection with kong newcomers include trapper dan stevens a kaiju dentist and mikael alex ferns a nononsense military pilot the movie tries to develop an adoptive motherdaughter storyline between ilene and jia with the latter trying to find her place but its done in such a clunky unsubtle way that it loses all possible emotional impact in truth kongs interactions with a young gorilla are as affecting  its tempting to say that godzilla x kong is the worst written of the major kaiju movies but that would be shortsighted this is after all a franchise that included among other gems destroy all monsters which is best watched drunk stoned or both the level of plotting and dialogue evident in godzilla x kong are on par with the worst of michael bays transformers travesties godzilla x kong would have been better if it had been 100 cgi with no people whatsoever then it could have concentrated more on the thing people see these movies for in the first place no one goes to a godzilla movie for rebecca hall  anyone seeing godzilla x kong may be disappointed by godzillas arc he doesnt do much except romp around engaging in the occasional bout of destruction and fighting other titans his goal is supercharging himself so his dorsal plates turn a pretty pinkpurple kong meanwhile gets a lions share of the screen time as he searches for others of his kind then tries to prevent the hollow earth apocalypse from spilling over to the outer world he gets to try his hand at parenting in sequences that director adam wingard improbably says were inspired by three men and a baby and reconnects with jia when he goes to see the dentist  as with other godzilla movies this recalls earlier films unfortunately most arent the best associations a lot of the kong material causes a bad acid trip flashback to the 1986 monstrosity king kong lives there are far too many similarities for this to be coincidental although the mechanical heart has been replaced by an artificial tooth and the godzilla stuff doesnt exactly resurrect memories of the king of monsters at his best  more like when he was tangling with things like the smog monster aka hedorah during the 1970s tone is something wingard struggles with although the best godzilla movies have been serious endeavors with allegorical elements the teamupssmackdowns have tended toward high camp with wwestyle flourishes starting with king kong vs godzilla the tohoproduced movies grew increasingly silly during the showa era had godzilla x kong fully embraced this tone rather than trying for things like emotional resonance it might have been more enjoyable however while there are comedicsatirical aspects the movie as a whole takes itself too seriously when watching something like this i occasionally feel like deferring to my eightyearold monster movieloving self i think that version of myself would have been a little bored by the lengthy periods of setup then delighted by the three big battles kong vs king scar kong vs godzilla redux konggodzillamothra vs king skarshimo but even for those who have an orgasmic reaction to kaiju confrontations far too little of the film is devoted to them and the overreliance on cgi leeches away the immediacy and awe associated with the spectacle this isnt as bad as the 1998 godzilla misfire but its perilously close if there are to be any more monsterverse movies something i dont favor turn them over to takashi yamazaki he knows how to do it right
Mar 30 2024,positive, when a burst of seemingly random radio interference is identified by monarch  an ignored predictor of previous kaiju confrontations  everyone is on high alert especially godzilla who appears to be powering up for a coming battle somewhere on earths surface jia kaylee hottle the last surviving member of the iwi tribe from skull island also appears to be attuned to the warning signal a source of worry for her guardian dr ilene andrews rebecca hall safe from a certain overgrown nuclear lizard a lonely kong has been searching the hollow earth for remnants of his own kind and finding nothing until an uncharted subterranean region becomes exposed along with titan truth podcaster bernie hayes brian tyree henry and titan vet tech trapper dan stevens ilene and jia follow the unique signal into the hollow earth but when an ancient threat rises to the occasion it may take more than godzilla and kong putting aside their differences to save us all warner bros and legendary have unleashed their newest titanpowered spectacle with director adam wingard following up on his previous entry godzilla vs kong the initial teasers for the new film featured a mechanical appendage for kong and godzilla swapping his trademark blue atomic power for barbie pink fueling online speculation  and whats all this the new empire nonsense looking like iron maiden is about to drop anther new album apple tv watchers whove absorbed season one of monarch legacy of monsters may be wondering how any or all of that backstory fits in with this fifth installment of the monsterverse franchise with a significantly lower reported budget than previous installments and moviegoers itching for an excuse to invade their local multiplex instead of staying home with a simultaneous hbomax release how big could the new empire get on the heels of successes dune part 2 and ghostbusters frozen empire and yes even last years godzilla minus one while this film may only be the next big loud theater entry to more casual moviegoers detailobsessed fans of the monsterverse are in for a treat not only does new empire look incredible with splashes of color and marked improvements in vfx it boasts the craziest battles since king of the monsters in context even the weirdest glimpses from the trailers make sense and the story is amazingly easy to follow considering huge swaths of time between human dialogue sequences the titans are front and center this time from a sleepy downtime godzilla to an overwhelmed and driven kong viewers can feel the emotion coming from these creatures including a perfect im too old for this shit expression when kong realizes he has to confront godzilla again there are a couple of surprises too which wont be spoiled here but with so many secrets being divulged out of monarchs media control the ending of this latest entry means there are plenty of directions to go from here as long as audiences keep showing up last years oscarwinning godzilla minus one was a great war movie that just happened to include godzilla it isnt part of the legendary monsterverse and exists independently from it in spite of all the inspiration drawn from toho new empire is exactly what it claims to be a fun ride at the movies as a shared experience the attention to detail for the cgi designs and the practical sets are easter eggs all their own from a despondent kong trying to make a social connection to bernie hayes scruffy podcastcentral home whenever a portal from the hollow earth opens up near a new unmutotouched city its giggleworthy hearing the collective groan of the audience knowing whats about the happen there and unable to look away its also a nice touch the way monarch has evolved to go with the flow of their hero titans rather than stand against them although they too often seem to be the last in the know considering their chosen role as earths gatekeepers the human characters exist for context exposition and to lend a helping hand when necessary  which is exactly perfect  while world governments look for excuses to cut funding to the very folks best able to help out  which is spot on make no mistake new empire is a destructive slugfest spectacle delivering what audiences want and will cheer for the unearthly beasts previously thought of as fanciful scribbles in uncharted waters to quote captain barbossa youre off the edge of the map mate here there be monsters godzilla x kong the new empire is rated pg13 for creature violence action and figuring the big guys will go out for a beer afterward
Mar 30 2024,positive, ok so lets get into the math and start with that title equation the most baffling since ballistics ecks vs server i get that the word empire must test well with the algorithms because adam wingards latest installment of universals monsterverse follows on from ghostbusters frozen empire and theres nothing particularly empirical about either of them but how do you even say this apparently the x is silent so ive been saying godzilla times kong which is apparently wrong but what else does an x mean godzilla loves kong godzilla kissy kissy kong its not vs any more since godzilla and kong are batting for the same team in this slambang monster mash for the holidays so of course theres all sorts in hollow earth including a telekinetic tribe other kongs and another titan to fight despite top billing godzilla doesnt figure much even though were told his vitals are surging which sounds painful hes running down the clock with timewasting using the coliseum in rome as a crash pad in between minor kaiju fights but pressed into service as various factions converge for a monster smackdown amongst egypts pyramids in the final scenes theres more jukebox music kiss golden earring badfinger from several generations ago comedy reliefantagonism from dan stevens as a silly sausage englishman gibbering about funny turns adverts for volkwagen and alex ferns turns up to give us yet another comedy scot with a lessthanradical reworking of the hoariest clichés about scottish aggression im going to take your camera and shove it up your arse he cries seconds before being gobbled up by something or other ive reviewed all of the monsterverse projects at three stars and this one is no different for all the talk of something weve never encountered its all much of a muchness these new titans are world protectors and the one here caused the ice age but one giant lizard is much like another and its up to mothra after a phonedin twoline intro to shake things up as a late substitute much as mechagodzilla did in the previous film most of the hollow earth creatures have green snot for blood which makes the fights seem less violent and returning characters make small talk about their new hairstyles and run into each others backs like the hair bear bunch when confronted with the next disposable monster hollow earth is something of a bore with no sense of scale watching kong face off against a bunch of other apes they might as well just be normal sized and i could have done without kongs wee gingernut pal pictured above who can fro as far as im concerned something of a stopgap while we figure out what comes after superhero blockbusters godzilla twitters kong is a serviceable continuation of a crowdpleasing if unexceptional franchise  brief bland just about passable holiday fare i actually left the theatre with a headache earlier today it was transformers and man of steel all over again i recall towards the end actually wishing the human characters would have another scene to break it up a bit takes a lot for me of all people to be so harsh on godzilla films for how much a fan of i am but this film was so bad i literally left the theatre physically worst off dont even know how to start writing my own review of it yet i had forgot to mention my theory on the titles x is that the directors cut of this film will only be available on select adult websites godzilla minus one may have been the very best film i saw last year saw it in black  white and i think ultimately it may be a mic drop moment for me as far as future godzilla films id seen them all up until it but i dont think i need to see any more high praise i dont understand why they didnt run an awards campaign in the uk but did in the us but thats how i missed it have been looking forward to it for months very annoying saw this film yesterday for me perhaps the worst godzilla movie ive seen  now i know enough to not compare it to the epic godzilla minus one im talking comparing it to any other godzilla films made from say 1985 on bad bad bad andbad but from an outsiders perspective you including a link to a movie on your site in every single comment youve made comes across as incredibly spammy talk about those other movies but it looks like 100 selfpromotion with the link every time fair point im not trying to spam links just sharing my content thats all but if you have a problem with it i understand  youre not the first person to confront me about this i will leave it to the blog to decide whether to accept or reject my comments not self promotion a way of sharing my love for films with the world thanks for the comment however i just feel that its a useful way of sharing content i dont allow comments on my website anymore due to cyberbullying ive had enough of wordpress which isnt a very nice platform for promoting content but i will try and keep links to my website to a minimum thank you for making me aware of the issue minus one is pure japanese godzilla far away from the warner monsterverse and i confirm its great so is the 2016 shin godzilla directed by hideaki anno father of evangelion jumping in here have you seen the original evangelion and the 4part movie reboot im wondering if the reboot is worth the time to watch i have a pretty high tolerance for this sort of crap but from the look of the trailer even this may be testing it so much crap out there this demo site is only for demonstration purposes all images are copyrighted to their respective owners all content cited is derived from their respective

Mar 30 2024,positive,a good enough time for monster lovers even if it does feel like king kong with special appearance by godzilla at the end
Mar 30 2024,negative, godzilla x kong the new empire is a fresh tale of kaijus vs kaijus as the subjectively enormous titans fight for the fate of humanity the world is full of dangers from manmade weapons to ecological disasters but in the world of movies theres another unpredictable threat capable of mass destruction thats nearly impossible to stop kaijus with military forces barely able to make a scratch these giant monsters only natural enemies are each other like aliens in our domain they dont belong in some cases humans disrupted the creatures native habitats or worse still ripped them from their homes and brought them into strange cities in other instances sensing the environmental harms being intensified around the globe they arose from their deep slumbers to make things right in godzilla x kong the new empire a fresh set of titans enter the arena monarch is the government agency tasked with monitoring kaiju activity in and around earth and ilene andrews rebecca hall is the head of the team that watches over kong in hollow earth her adopted daughter jia kaylee hottle maintains a strong connection with the colossal ape but shes having issues fitting into her new life on the surface meanwhile godzilla serves as humanitys protector against the other kaijus that wreak havoc around the globe however there is an unidentified signal putting everyone and everything on edge but with the help of conspiracy theorist bernie brian tyree henry and kaiju vet trapper dan stevens illene and jia are going back to hollow earth to figure it out whether its a warning or call for help there is something else coming and the titans are preparing for the battle of a century director adam wingard primarily made horror movies before entering the epic monsterverse first pitting the giant icons against each other and now placing them on the same side of a largerthanlife war theres a few separate stories unfolding for most of this picture as everyone is on their own mission to prepare for whats coming before their paths finally converge at the end its big and the battles result in unparalleled destruction across several major cities leaving audiences in wonder and bewilderment at the devastation that has become acceptable collateral damage for coexisting with these creatures however in spite of the immensity of the characters the film has a major issue with scale these monsters are supposed to be hundreds of stories tall but in many of the scenes its difficult to determine how big they really are the camera angles do not covey size and unless theyre framed next to a skyscraper or human theres no way to gauge the kaijus enormity which diminishes some of the narratives awesomeness nonetheless the action sequences do not disappoint and the city battles are where their magnitude is most apparent and applicable to further up the ante godzilla has levelled up with new atomic breath and kong is sporting a shiny mech hand that makes him even stronger the presence of an unexpectedly upbeat soundtrack that includes loverboys turn me loose and kiss i was made for lovin you also adds a layer of entertainment to these scenes copyright  1998  2023 digital journal inc sitemaps xml  news  digital journal is not responsible for the content of external sites read more about our external linking 
Mar 30 2024,positive, theres about half an hour of amusingly goofy material in godzilla x kong the new empire but the movie is nearly two hours long so your mileage may vary arriving on the heels of godzilla minus onean emotional war drama from japans toho studiosthis american kaiju cousin takes more after godzillas late showa era in the 60s and 70s with its actionfigure sensibility unfortunately the iconic lizard ends up backgrounded for most of the movie but its incarnation of king kong has enough of a human spark to be charming and fun godzilla x kong is the latest entry in warner bros ongoing monsterverse which turns 10 this year the series features an electric godzilla reboot a deviously fun kong reimagining skull island a middling kaiju mashup godzilla king of the monsters an underwhelming crossover godzilla vs kong and even a godzilla show on apple tv monarch legacy of monsters theres a definite continuity between themcharacters tend to cross over between films though they seldom last more than two entriesbut you neednt be too concerned with whos who kong is the main event and he isnt the only titan around on the human side of things the last films monster expert ilene andrews rebecca hall returns alongside her adopted daughter jia kaylee hottlea mute indigenous girl who shares a special connection with kongand they inexplicably seek the help of returning conspiracy radio host bernie hayes brian tyree henry who still has a chronic case of the quips symptoms include a lack of sincerity in the face of beauty and the compulsive need to make wry observations about the movie youre in their roles largely involve extraneous set up however while it takes the movie about an hour to even establish its central premise from there on out things get kind of wacky the film is largely set within hollow earth the subterranean realm introduced in 2021s godzilla vs kong where enormous kongsized flora and fauna run wild free of human influence kong is content down there but as the last of his species hes on the lookout for more giant apes though none seem to exist you know what they say though be careful what you wish for after jia begins experiencing psychic visions which ilene and bernie learn are underground distress signals they join up with a roguish monsterveterinarian trapper dan stevens having the time of his life in a hawaiian shirt and head down into hollow earth to see whats going on none of this is very interesting and the film seems to rocket past any jokes conversation exposition or even shots of objects and creatures that might make it feel remotely coherent dont leave just yet though near its hour mark kong goes off on his own subterranean adventure and he does in fact discover a society of giant apes like himself he fights some of themhe even throws a giant baby orangutan at them who he then befriendsand he seeks to free the rest of them from the clutches of a tyrannical redfurred ape known as the scar king who wields a whip made of a serpents spine and psychically controls his own ice godzilla with whom he hopes to escape to the surface world and unleash a new ice age no you arent having a stroke yes thats the real premise of this movie in the absence of boring human characters who take the time to explain every image on screenas if the studio notes had insisted that audiences are complete moronsthese dialoguefree sections focused entirely on the giant apes are a ludicrous delight it takes a long time to get there but seeing the lanky scar king posing like an androgynous anime villain speaks to the kind of movie that director adam wingard truly wants to make one where image and body language pop and the action involves overthetop theatrics kong wields a bone ax with a godzilla scale for a blade godzilla suplexes kong into a great pyramid when they finally come face to face as though they were played by prowrestlers in chunky costumes recalling godzillas maninmonstersuit roots unfortunately the film wingard is allowed to make ends up restrained by the kind of production issues that have plagued modern hollywood for several years chief among them is a seemingly rushed production pipeline which ensures that overworked vfx artists arent allowed the chance to render creatures that have a definitive sense of weight or scale the kaiju and the humans rarely feel like they exist within the same physical spacewhich is part of why the movie works best when kong and the other apes are off in their own corner of hollow earth where size doesnt matter granted in a movie about giant apes and lizards it absolutely should but wingard and co make do with the hand theyre dealt godzilla spends most of the movie either sleeping amusingly in romes coliseum or recharging his batteries underwater and changing color but when he finally joins forces with kongwho trapper outfits with a mechanized enhancement ie a robot hand that punches real hardthings get delightfully loopy conceptually the film seems to anticipate having to work with weightless cgi and actually pits its characters against a scenario that takes advantage of hollow earths bizarro physics the result is a hilarious romp an absurd if shortlived action set piece where giant apes and lizards float across the screen while trying to knock each other silly to get to this stage you have to put up with a whole lot of painful expositionat times hall literally reads backstory and setup off the wall of an ancient ruinbut if youre able to put up with it the payoff is cotton candy it also helps that kong retains his distinctly human traits like mild annoyance from previous films fans of skull island who recall him casually slurping a giant octopus like spaghetti will feel especially catered to unfortunatelyor perhaps fortunately if you squirm easilygodzilla x kong isnt as gross or tactile as it wants to be owing once again to shoddy visual effects which rob several scenes involving blood guts and monster goop of their cartoonish impact sadly even recommending godzilla x kong comes wrapped in caveats and apologies given how little of it actually works it has none of the scale or grandeur of hollywoods 2014 godzillaor japanese highlights like minus one shin godzilla or the original 1954 gojiralet alone any of the brazen political imagery of skull island orthe original 1954 gojira but if you feel starved for hints of bigbudget hollywood spectacle wingards latest entry has just enough by way of imaginative shlock to scratch that particular itch until something better comes along
Mar 29 2024,positive, godzilla x kong the new empire the weirdly punctuated fifth monster mash in the legendary pictures monsterverse saga that kicked off with gareth edwards 2014 reboot godzilla is a good enough good time wherein a capable company of gifted actors elevate the predictable material  i refer of course to the ultraheavyweights in the title roles the last surviving 300foot ape from skull island and the even larger i think radiationabsorbingandredistributing amphibian are both showing their age in this fun but frivolous installment they also seem to be burdened by more than a little mutual resentment that theyre in another teamup movie instead of being free to continue their solo star vehicles this one is a direct sequel to 2021s godzilla vs kong which i definitely saw and from which i cannot recall a goddamn frame their bickeringbuddycop dynamic is clearly a concession to an increasingly competitive market for kaiju flicks the most recent japanese production starring big g last years godzilla minus one shares a title that sounds like an equation with this american one but it cost about a 10th what godzilla x kong didand its roughly 10 times as good  so godzilla x kong does the reluctantallies thing for the second time in two movies and it cant quite hide that despite their palpable lovehate chemistry onscreen g and k probably dont get along any better in real life than bruce willis and cybill shepherd maybe kong is jealous that this movie not only gives his scaly costar top billing but also lets him  claim the colosseum in rome as his very own dog bed leaving it only reluctantly and curling up back inside the arena where russell crowe won an academy award for demanding are you not entertained once the days citysmashing is done the big apes grievances are not without merit while i cant deny that unconscious speciesism almost certainly makes me more sympathetic to kong than to the artist formerly known as gojira based on their performances here kong is clearly the more versatile and expressive actor  the everreliable rebecca hall and brian tyree henry reprising their roles from the prior entry are here too demonstrating once again what stonecold pros they both are when theyre not showing their bona fides in tonier flicks such as passing and if beale street could talk respectively henry as a neurotic podcast host determined to blow the lid off the giantmonster conspiracy that that entire world already seems to know all about has the easier job his performance is all fright and astonishment with minimal expository fiber its hall who must chew her ways through lines like tell the italian military rome wouldve been flattened if not for godzilla and its some undocumented vortex she does it by god shes a trooper halls character is also our emotional anchor having adopted jia deaf child actor kaylee hottle presumed to be the last survivor of a tribe of people native to skull jia feels like an outcast among the other scientists kids on the monarch compoundmonarch being the multinational kaijumonitoring agency in these moviesbut has a bond with kong with whom she can communicate in sign language dan stevens shows up too as a naturalistkaiju veterinarian who makes his entrance using some kind of hovercrane to pull an infected tooth from the sedated big apes mouth the film does not tell us how much dope it takes to prevent kong from waking up while youre ripping one of his teeth out i wanted to know the dentistry sequence as future generations of cinephiles and sight and sound poll respondents shall doubtless refer to it is the climax to what is in essence a fun short film that plays over the opening titles kong is on the hunt somewhere in hollow earth as one of the films three best locationestablishing title cards tells us and just the fact that hes fleeing from a group of vicious packhunting creatures seems to suggest his reign is faltering i was sure i saw some gray fur in his face during this sequence and the fact he must rely on cunning rather than brute strength to make his wouldbe predators back off suggests hes slowing down after that battle a different creature steals kongs meal and he just seems too tired to resist he worked for his supper too ripping one of those pursuing creatures in half above his head and then showering its green entrails out of his fur beneath a waterfall truly if i were rating just the first 10 minutes of this film id award it five stars  alas theres about another hour and 45 after that which knocks the star count down to a respectable three save for the fivestar interlude wherein kong after suffering a greivous injury to his right forearm gets upgraded with a fucking robot fist the fist is not some juryrigged solution welded together from m1 abrams tanks and diesel locomotives or whatever but a readytowear onesizefitsone apecessory that the monarch people just had lying around no questions please five stars my own unerring professionalism compels me to say theres a plot to this film wherein some kind of mysterious signal emanating from the world beneath the surface turns out to portend a threat that requires the combined might of g and k and a whole lot of collateral damage to resolve it isnt so absorbing that it kept me from wondering exactly how much of this film was computeranimated as not just the creatures but many of the environments have a screensavery quality that absent the truly immersive digital trickery of avatar and its sequel just looks a little flat  the 2014 edwards godzilla had a somber quality about it a sense of the cost of all the destruction it documented making it metaphorically of a piece with the best of the toho kaiju movies including the 1954 originalsuffused with the trauma of a nation that had two atomic bombs dropped on it in less than a decade priorand 2023s godzilla minus one theres none of that richness here even franchises built around a more thoughtful premise than two giant beasts duking it out for our amusement tend to become parodies of themselves by the fifth outing godzilla x kong is fleet fun and forgettable and thats enough  writers note the other two title cards in the top three are the one that says subterranean realmuncharted area and the one that says cairo egypt over a shot of the fucking pyramids we dont have one readers like you keep our work free for everyone to read if you think that its important to have high quality local reporting we hope youll support our work with a monthly contribution
Mar 29 2024,negative, by walter chaw maybe this is how it starts though i know we must be in the middle if not at the end more to the point maybe this is when we notice how close we are to the door to the processing houseto the slaughter i want to be clear for posteritys sake that i believe we are at the very edge of it i want it to be on record that im afraid i think we may even be inside in the stench of its fear and blood and shit popeyed with the toolate realization that all this time we were waiting in this line for this outcome and weve known it all along we have been conditioned to be surprised every single time it swims to our attention for a few minutes which used to happen infrequently first years then months then days then hours apart soon it will be seconds that our lives hold no value to the machineries running us save for the material weight of our flesh we have been conditioned to forget this every time were accidentally confronted with it again they did it by teaching us to questionand discountthe suffering of others not completely not everyone and not yet but mostly and some of you are making me a little worried i feel like kevin mccarthy in invasion of the body snatchers although im not as sure im who i used to be anymore either adam wingards execrable godzilla x kong the new empire is too foul and hamfisted to be the cause of anything but it like sputum when examined under a microscope might point to the root malady spreading through us like fire through dry brush it is an exercise in nihilism in antiempathy it is a punishing bludgeoning sensory device punctuated at regular intervals by the wholesale annihilation of monuments to human achievement while laying waste to cities without also showing the agony of people in the seconds before theyre turned to paste and buried under rubble in 2015 the terrorist group isis broke into a museum and destroyed artifacts of the assyrian empire i remember it was referred to as an act of cultural genocide in a campaign to eradicate traces of preislamic culture in areas they controlled the images of it left me nauseous using american weaponry israel is now levelling landmarks and universities in an area they would like to populate with settlers and were not allowed to call that anything other than righteous when i see the parthenon vaporized in a bigscale entertainment intended for a mass audience i think about the trailer for michael bays pearl harbor and how crowds cheered the technical wizardry that gave us a bombseye view of ordnance dropped on american servicemen at least this was seen as tasteless and problematic at the time i doubt godzilla x kong will inspire any dialogues of the sort part of that is because godzilla x kong is inoculated against criticism lob any at it and you will be identified as a humourless scold incapable of joy the joy of an animated baby gorilla having an hourslong conversation with an animated adult gorilla through gestures wet eyes and yawps the joy of glimpsing toshiro mifunes performance from yojimbo as its surreptitiously mapped onto the face of a giant ape the joy of seeing the great pyramids reduced to bricks and sand as part of the grand spectacle of erasing any evidence of spiritual aspiration from the face of this soulless wasteland speak of how godzilla and king kong both are loaded relics of the american empireartifacts of war crimes committed against the japanese and chattel slavery here at home respectivelyand be crowned king wet blanket at the bread and circus of the moment the minimum requirement is that this film be accepted the urgent demand is that it be enjoyed if you dont enjoy it theres something wrong with you if you dont enjoy a cacophonous invasive unimaginative slog a twohour strobe light of a thoughteradicating mindwipe that teaches us to watch the rio de janeiro beachfront get flattened along with a substantial portion of its six million inhabitants like a spectator at a wrestling match then theres something wrong with you you are too sensitive you wonder about all those people when the movie dummy is giant things engaging in inscrutable battles using your lives as collateral justification and cannon fodder all at once king kong rides godzilla for a second in slowmotion as they launch themselves also in slowmotion into battle with a red ape and its servant a frost lizard the red ape by the way wields a whip and controls hundreds of black apes like kong in a quarry where theyre treated like slaves i mention this because you might tell me im reading into the kong character and not out if im doing it the filmmakers are doing it toothe difference being they dont want you to think about it the mystical native earth child from the last film jia kaylee hottle returns to again be the pure avatarlike stereotype who serves as a bridge between man and beast with the added issue of interracial adoption in a horrifyingly glib subplot about her relationship with her new mom dr andrews rebecca hall if the demand is that i not dwell on things like this in a movie that is such garbage you must not think about it before during or afterwards to fully enjoy it i wonder why this was even included there is a band of natives in the film all portrayed by asian actors who dont talknot even their leader played by hong kong actor fala chen who found her most tremendous success recently in a television soap in which she plays another nonverbal character is this providence or a play at acceptance into the chinese market whatever it is its a lot of asians in mystical outfits doing magic among the apes in the middle of the planet if you are bothered by any of the racial dynamics of godzilla x kong youre obviously doing it wrong do not be bothered by anything thats the first step the next is to enjoy the thing that is bothersome like it slurp it up none of this is to say that i loathe this movie for its shoddy politics and abhorrent timing i loathe it because its terrible in every other conventional way as well the dialogue is appalling slack and rhythmlessa conductor using an old piece of celery in place of a baton to beat you into thundering exhausted submission fwap fwap fwap to liven things up wingard attempts a james gunnism randomly dropping badfinger and kiss into incoherent action dumps but the tracks are witlessly curated and employed just like the previous entrys insertion of a dobie gray classic that saw kong longing for the freedom of his chains comic relief dan stevens and brian tyree henry have whatever timing comes naturally to them neutered by lousy editing and worse writing while poor hall cant save her character from being the thing that says i forgot to tell you to introduce one loud deus ex machina after another shes the ring girl who tosses a folding chair into the cage match eat it up paying customers i will say that the monsters dont destroy christ the redeemer even though its right there to be used as a cudgel or a sap why doesnt godzilla x kong demolish a catholic relic the way it destroys egyptian asian and ancient roman ones didnt i tell you to stop thinking its not a plot that drives godzilla x kong its a march of chryons and establishing shots identifying what theyre going to pulverize on the way to a touching scene where kong adopts red ape baby and jia tells dr andrews that despite all the contrary evidence of her actions and convictions she would rather be in dr andrewss white upperclass world than in middleofearth with her fabulous asian children of the planet savouring their cirque du soleil matinees and revues you are allowed to feel touched by this cheap unearned and dishonest sentiment you are allowed to wallow in the majesty of the eradication of hundreds of thousands of human lives vanished at your pleasure you are not allowed to think about who you were when things bothered you or who youve since become at least until the door closes behind you and you hear the blade meant for you sharpen against the strop then you can think about that all you want go ahead
Mar 29 2024,positive, directed by adam wingard written by terry rossio simon barrett jeremy slater and wingard based on the character godzilla created by toho co ltd runtime 115 minutes mpa rating pg13 for intense sequences of creature violencedestruction and brief language the epic monsterverse continues in godzilla x kong the new empire in this new colossal showdown the bitter enemies godzilla and kong must form an unlikely alliance to face a greater threat that endangers the planet godzilla x kong is by no means a deeply thoughtful postwar drama exploring the tragedy and trauma that war brings to its victims instead the new empire opts for big monster blockbuster thrills the movie succeeds and delivers on that front but the rest of the plot is sorely lacking picking up about two years after godzilla vs kong the world resettles into the posttitans era kong has safely relocated to hollow earth where monarch has its own observatory outpost meanwhile godzilla resides on earths surface taking care of the other more disastrous titan menaces in between naps in the roman colosseum kong now holds dominion as the alpha creature of his new homeland but he longs for companionship however the notion that kong is the last of his kind is deeply misguided soon kong inadvertently unlocks a gateway leading deeper into hollow earth where the other great apes have been imprisoned for thousands of years meanwhile something from hollow earth is sending out a signal thats being received by jia hottle the last surviving iwi villager who was adopted by dr ilene andrews hall and befriended kong after titan podcaster bernie hayes tyree henry helps uncover the origin and nature of the signal dr andrews brings jia bernie and titan veterinarian trapper stevens along for a recon mission to get to the bottom of the mission they eventually discover a deadly new titan that could threaten the world but their discovery also holds the key to jias destiny meanwhile the signal coming from hollow earth prompts godzilla to absorb massive amounts of energy as he preps for the greatest battle of his life the monsterverses longstanding problem of dull human characters persists through the new empire talented thespians make up the cast but they serve little purpose besides providing the audience with perfunctory exposition dumps these scenes lack any notable substance and only serve to break up the major kaiju fights and action  what does work about the new empire is how the film builds the titan characters beyond just big smashing monsters the titans emerge as the most fascinating and textured characters of the story most of the action in the new empire is driven by kong as he seeks to solve the mystery of the hidden pathway in hollow earth these scenes have no dialogue and the titans primal actions and physical behavior drive the sequences forward the intent of the titans comes across through their visual actions and body language  wingard excels as a filmmaker in these interesting scenes whenever the humans show up again they follow traditionally boring predictable beats reciting corny jokes or verbalizing hackneyed dialogue the human characters are usually the least compelling part of any godzilla movie and while that should not be the case there is little reason to care about them early on a monarch soldier mikael ferns is introduced as the lone military escort for the reconnaissance mission to hollow earth at first mikael appears to be a reasonable and workable character as the plot unfolds mikael quickly spirals into becoming a onenote antagonistic idiot who meets a predictable fate the new empire is not interested in elevating the human subplot and that is fine to a point since the monster material works exceptionally well  the main drawback of the central threat is the payoff of the new villain dubbed the scar king who doesnt quite meet the buildup considering godzilla spends most of the movie preparing for the battle of his life the scar king should be more formidable he certainly has a unique design but it seems like he needs to present a stronger threat as the titan who draws kong and godzilla into fighting together  when the titans clash the action is undoubtedly entertaining the fights meet the massive scale of the monsters and humans are merely spectators rather than active participants however tom holkenborgs overly bombastic score fails to meet the majesty of these cinematic icons there is a hint of a decent theme when godzilla is onscreen but it never meets its full potential  godzilla x kong the new empire takes positive steps with developing the titans as characters rather than merely big setpieces but the human elements are still woefully lacking the new empire acts more like a tribute by wingard to the later showa era films of godzillas cinematic history it works relatively well in that respect at least when its time for the kaiju to smash up the

Mar 29 2024,positive, never underestimate the power of a movie that makes you feel like a kid again watching godzilla x kong the new empire reminded me of sitting in a massive theater gazing up at the screen in awe as it showed godzilla vs megalon and the 1976 version of king kong those largerthanlife creatures captured my imagination and honestly never let go this newest entry in the warner bros monsterverse is a great big nonsensical hemorrhage of cgi thats not going to earn points for plot and characterization it does however deliver spectacularly on the promise of giant monsters engaging in epic feuds in the followup to 2020s godzilla vs kong kong now lives in the hollow earth ie the center of the planet godzilla is above ground sleeping inside the colisseum in rome dr ilene andrews rebecca hall detects bizarre seismic activity coming from kongs realm so she assembles a team that includes large animal dentist trapper dan stevens and conspiracy theory podcaster bernie hayes brian tyree henry they venture into hollow earth only to discover that the activity is a call for help that will force the adversarial titans to join forces against a common foe a vicious ape called skar king theres more to it than that but describing it is useless because the story is mostly present to bide time between sequences of monster chaos a whole subplot exists about a lost tribe in hollow earth and how it relates to andrews adopted daughter jia kaylee hottle you wont care about it too much the game cast holds these sections together hall brings a reliable sense of purpose to her character while stevens and henry provide appealing comic relief were here for the monsters we get them boy do we ever get them godzilla and kong do battle among the pyramids in egypt kong and a baby ape take on skar king and his minions the last twentyfive minutes constitute an enormous destructionheavy melee that incorporates another familiar kaiju from the world of godzilla and sees kong fitted with a mechanical arm for extra punch strength if you grew up loving monster movies of this sort its almost impossible not to feel a little giddy about it all director adam wingard is obviously a fan himself so the mayhem is staged with real enthusiasm godzilla x kong the new empire must be approached with that mindset the film makes no pretention of being anything other than a wild ride with these beloved characters a willingness to not take itself too seriously is the tipoff certain moments are clearly meant to be funny or selfmocking whereas a picture like godzilla minus one  which is admittedly superior  uses the kaiju concept to explore deeper themes wingard and crew are coming from a more visceral angle if a 9yearold kid playing with godzilla and king kong action figures could have their ideas magically transferred to the screen the result would not be terribly different from what we get my mind ran on two tracks for most of the running time the intellectual side was saying this is silly and empty cgi overload the emotional side was saying im having a lot of fun watching this both sides were fighting just like godzilla and king kong in the end the emotional side won out feeling like a kid again for a couple hours was a wonderful detour in my day
Mar 29 2024,negative,135m worth of hollywood gruel
Mar 29 2024,neutral, theres life left in the godzilla franchise and it was seen in last years godzilla minus one a monster movie made at human scale which made you care about things like story character and yes that big radioactive lizard at the center of all the chaos godzilla x kong the new empire was already in the bag by the time godzilla minus one surfaced so it had no time to learn any of its lessons but it could have benefitted from them any of them because even while this monster mash features two larger than life mega movie icons it cant find a single interesting thing to do with either of them ok theres one godzilla who stomps around the globe leaving a wake of destruction in his path what else is new occasionally gets sleepy and when he does he curls up inside the colosseum in rome like the family dog plopping down in its bed thats a good bit and it stands out in a movie that could use a lot more of them godzilla x kong the new empire picks up after 2021s godzilla vs kong and the x between their names signifies that theyre not so much feuding anymore as theyre working on a brand collab this movie is their collab theyre off doing their own thing with kong in hollow earth and godzillas whereabouts on the surface closely monitored by a team of scientisttypes tasked with keeping eyes on him and theres peace between the two parties sort of until theres not kong who runs afoul with a new bunch of giant beasts pops up to earth through the portal thats been set up for him because hes got a cracked tooth which is fixed by trapper dan stevens who plays a freewheeling rock and roll dentist with feathered hair and an aussie accent at least stevens is having fun trapper is part of a team of humans who follow kong back down to hollow earth and are occasionally asked to spell out the details of the films plot which are wholly convoluted and nearly impossible to make heads or tails of rebecca hall is dr ilene andrews and shes forced to explain things like godzillas moods and how it affects all the screen goingson ilene has an adopted daughter jia kaylee hottle who speaks to kong in sign language and is the last of her iwi tribe brian tyree henry plays a paranoid podcaster whos always talking about livestreams and his followers this group serves to narrate the story such as it is while the monsters get prepped for another big showdown godzilla and kong arent alone kong comes across a gang of evil kongs led by skar king who carries a whip made from some monsters vertebrae which looks like a weapon out of mortal kombat hes also got his own godzillatype monster whose breath spews a freezing agent whom he keeps as an enslaved pet theres also a diddy konglike redhaired little guy because as baby yoda and the ministay puft marshmallow men have shown we love tiny cute versions of our favorite screen characters and they make great plush toys fights ensue because of course they do and what else would they be doing here if not destroying cities and world landmarks into piles of rubble sorry pyramids you were fun while you lasted heres the thing though at this point in movie history  and in godzilla and kong history who have more than 50 movies between them  weve seen all the monster clashes and city destroying we ever need to see and unless theres a human element to grasp onto its all just a whir of digital effects and cgi vomit with no emotional connection or reason to invest godzilla minus one worked not because of how big it was but because of how small it was and the care with which it was made godzilla x kong wants to be a topoftheline allout battle of the brutes but for all its size it barely manages to hold your attention because theres no human element at its core director adam wingard  who it should be noted gave stevens his best film role in 2014s gothtinged 80s homage the guest  at least attempts to lighten things up and bring some levity to the proceedings but its mostly a lost cause godzilla x kong is as big and loud as expected but when the dust is settled theres nothing to hold onto the kaiju clash is a crushing bore
Mar 29 2024,positive, this year marks two milestones in kaiju history the first and most important is that it has been seventy years since everyones favorite giant atomic breathspewing lizard first tromped across tokyo in gojira its also been ten years since the premiere of the first entry into what is now called the monsterverse gareth edwards godzilla in this past decade we have been introduced to many kaijuor titans as these films refer to them the mutos massive unidentified terrestrial organism a term which was replaced by titan mothra king ghidorah rodan mechagodzilla several other minor titans and of course king kong while kong and godzilla were enemies in the previous film aptly titled godzilla vs kong they now have to learn to live with each others existence in the new entry godzilla x kong the new empire since their defeat of mechagodzilla kong has taken up residence in hollow earth the world below our ground while godzilla resides up top to protect us whenever another titan gets a little uppity kong has been searching for any others like him but has found nothing so far that is until a sinkhole opens revealing a subsubterranean world beneath his subterranean home there he meets a young ape named suko who reluctantly leads kong to a tribe of giant apes they are ruled over by the tyrannical skar king who long ago tried to take over the surface world only to be defeated and trapped in hollow earth by godzilla meanwhile up in our world young jia kaylee hottle the deaf only surviving member of the iwi tribe those who protected and served kong on skull island is having visions connected to hollow earth her adoptive mother dr ilene andrews rebecca hall is desperate to figure out what jias visions mean godzilla has also been affected by something and he appears to be absorbing energy in preparation for an oncoming fight dr andrews and jia accompanied by titan veterinarian trapper dan stevens and podcaster bernie hayes brian tyree henry travel down to hollow earth to figure out exactly what all this means godzilla x kong takes everything thats been fun about the japanese side of the franchise over the past seven decades and wraps it all in the spectacle weve come to expect from the hollywood versions directed by adam wingard the first director of a monsterverse film to return for a second goaround this is kaiju entertainment in its purest form giant monsters fighting each other with no regard to the destruction theyre causing yet something these monsterverse films have done pretty well too is create compelling human storylines we genuinely care about the safety of our team of explorers as they trek through this world thats still fairly alien to them granted having already gone on one filmic journey with most of them does help of course we have to address the kaiju in the room many people have been comparing godzilla x kong to godzilla minus one since they were released so close together this is completely unfair to godzilla x kong any film is going to pale in comparison when put up against the magnificent genius that is minus one that film is meant to tell a harrowing yet hopeful tale of not only a country dealing with an attack from a giant monster but also a country trying to rebuild after a devastating war godzilla x kong is the exact opposite and should be viewed as such this is a film thats obviously made by godzilla fans who like me grew up watching the older movies on saturday afternoons after our cartoons were over and we still wanted more tv time as such thats entirely how this film playsand it nails it so as long as you dont expect the heavy social examinations weve come to expect from the recent japanese output youll probably have as good of a time as i did hearst television participates in various affiliate marketing programs which means we may get paid commissions on editorially chosen products purchased through our links to retailer sites
Mar 29 2024,positive, there is a certain elegance in letting oneself go forget expectations and obligations and just focus on finding joy in what seems to matter most to a certain degree godzilla x kong the new empire has let itself go plot and character development are forgotten in lieu of effects and titan battles and it sometimes works just fine though when it tries to clasp to the remaining dregs of audience sympathy manipulation and world building it teeters toward collapse the film picks up a bit of time after its direct predecessor godzilla vs kong with a few of the same characters rebecca hall as ilene is the head of managing hollow earths research and her adoptive daughter and skull island orphan jia kaylee hottle is starting to go through preteen rebellion and a need to find her place in the world thankfully brian tyree henry is also back as internet armchair researcher and podcaster bernie bringing with him some muchneeded humor dont remember any of this from director adam wingards previous film dont worry about it for the most part godzilla x kong is a standalone entry into their cinematic universe in that the important bits of exposition are covered early and clearly and frankly do not seem to matter too much the real star and truthfully the only joy to be found in the film is the massive battles amongst titans both on the earths surface and below in hollow earth kong and gozilla are fighting their fights for survival and to remain at the top of the pecking order though godzillas motives for battles are initially unknown that does not stop them from being far flung across the globe and good splashy fun kongs mission is more of a personal undertaking as he fights to survive in hollow earth and search for where he belongs as the elected emotional anchor of the titans in this series there feels like more riding on the outcome of his battles but they rise to be just as bloody and inventive as godzillas skirmishes if all that is expected of a kaiju versus gargantuan gorilla film is some epic battles for honor and a few new creatures sprinkled in to heighten the stakes then godzilla x kong mostly succeeds the running time is largely dedicated to those expectations and it knows what is wanted however like so many monster movies with the glaring exceptions of godzilla minus one and shin godzilla the movie stumbles hard when it comes to forcing a human plot around all that good jungle mayhem kongs search for belonging mirrors jias similar path though they are both handled very differently without needing to or ever fully addressing it godzilla x kong chooses to veer into issues of slavery and captivity taking on such heavy material in a light but ferocious context feels reductive and convenient similarly ilenas reunion with former college friend and i swear i am not making this up kong dentist trapper dan stevens feels like a reason to have the two characters flirt a bit without any character or plot value added but in the end kong and godzilla and friends all fight the good fight while we get to sit back and take it all in if that was the singular goal of godzilla x kong the new empire it sure did do that thing all you need is death is the latest in the celtic folk horror genre that will appeal to fans of you are not my mother a hole in the ground and men in this unboxing video jason gorber checks out the joni mitchell archives volume 3 on vinyl and covers just what you get with this latest release
Mar 29 2024,positive,a big dumb fun kaiju movie thats all about the popcorn fun there are humans in it yes but we dont really care as the real action is watching apeonape apeonlizard and lizardonlizard action shift your brain into neutral and enjoy
Mar 29 2024,positive, the film is called godzilla x kong the new empire it is not hanks x streep or de niro x mirren that means you should not go into the theater expecting complicated character development intricate plot twists andor awardwinning performances this latest offering on the godzilla and king kong universe is an endless stream of action sequences stitched together by a thin script the human part of the cast  that includes the very talented rebecca hall  is about as necessary as a flea collar on king kong the new theatrical release is the follow up to godzilla vs kong since their last battle godzilla has been stomping through major cities to defeat the titans these citydestroying tussles never seem to take place in a rural area where the worst disaster would be a silo destruction godzilla actually has a plan he is absorbing vast amounts of energy including the devastation of a nuclear plant near paris that will have everyones croissants glowing occasionally a worthless human will make some statement about how godzilla must be planning something big this years oscar for stating the obvious goes to this film meanwhile kong is living a lonely life in the world that exists at the core of earth his search for other great apes creates a problem that requires a few stereotypical humans to visit the land that is really down under ilene andrews hall is a scientistmom who is torn between work and her newfound daughter jia kaylee hottle theres the local big animal vet in trapper dan stevens who is a poor mans peter quill rounding out the team is disrespected podcaster bernie hayes brian tyree henry also in the group is the pilot but he might as well be wearing a red shirt from star trek fans of the show will know the fate of the character these characters are needed to try to keep the film going as the script by terry rossio simon barrett and jeremy slater is never in a rush to get to the reason for the title godzillas tearing up cities above ground while kong is facing a large shrewdness of apes who want to rule the world big creature films like these never depend on logic or the laws of physics but there is an endless string of moments that are either unintentionally funny or cheats with the story just to get to the next big reveal one of kongs new buddies is a miniature version of him early in the film kong uses the baby ape as a living bat to beat other apes such abuse would leave any ape either dead or endlessly confused then there is the moment everyone realizes an injured kong cant win the day as luck would have it a prototype for a mechanical arm for kong was in a storage closet at the facility in the underworld site monitoring kong it is difficult not to laugh at such insulting moments in the script the biggest gaff is the discovery of writings that predate humans on the surface they tell of a great ape with a scar looking to rule the world that ape is still alive are they immortal dont ask the writers as they dont know director adam wingard  the man behind godzilla vs kong  is not slowed by the lack of story he loads the movie with huge fight sequences that are as fast paced as any transformer movie but are far easier to follow the work is solid enough that it makes the structure of having kong and godzilla not get together until the last 20 minutes all the sadder the film is being sold as the teaming of these film titans and that should have been the focus of much of the movie king kong has been terrorizing the world since 1933 while godzilla has been a pain in the tokyo for the japanese since 1954 they are strong enough to be the masters of their own action film and making them part of a zoological buddy story doesnt add anything it all comes down to your taste in movies if all you want is action the name says it all for the record in the name godzilla x kong the new empire the x is silent according to the studio why again dont ask the writers to have a successful garden you need to know when it is the best time to plant here are the best plants to start in may
Mar 29 2024,neutral, sure if its kaiju action youre looking for the new empire has it  and lots of it but its determination to explain its weirder elements takes away any sense of wonder or mystery poor rebecca hall is essentially wasted as an exposition machine saddled with pages of laboriously expository dialogue that makes sure the audience understands the whys and wherefores of every single detail of its convoluted plot what it misunderstands about those shōwa era films and the darker heisei era films whose neon cityscape battles it also emulates is that the plots of these films dont really matter everyone is here to see giant monsters duke it out and attempts to complicate that with intricate mythology to make it somehow more plausible feels like a shallow distraction from the main event in the case of godzilla x kong that mythology feels confusing at best and irrelevant at worst there are some fun monster battles to be had here and the reappearance of mothra is a welcome surprise after she was essentially wasted in king of the monsters even if it still doesnt really seem like the american films know what to do with her but the film feels painfully bloated it also has the unfortunate position of being released just three months after tohos oscarwinning godzilla minus one and while these are clearly two different films with two very different aims its almost impossible not to look at the japanese film and think that toto is doing this better than their american counterparts this may be a more lighthearted adventure than the more somber minus one but godzilla x kong feels buried under the weight of its own mythology at once overexplained and undercooked
Mar 29 2024,positive,this might be one of the dumbest movies i have ever seen and yet i cant help but find myself enjoying the heck out of it gxk delivers a ton of action spectacle and a whole lot of blockbuster moments audiences should get what they pay for with this
Mar 29 2024,neutral, as the old saying goes there are two kinds of people on this earth those who like their movies with a giant evil ape swinging a vertebrae like a lasso while riding a kaiju controlled by a crystal and those who dont the former types will have much to cheer in godzilla x kong the new empire a groundstomping radiationspewing monstermash feast technically we are not on this earth were inside it in a subterranean jungle world that gives the movies filmmakers an exotic untrampled realm in which they try to chart some new ground for a pair of welltraveled beasts but aside from the films strong jules verne streak godzilla x kong is no drastic pivot for its longinthetooth monsters for that you were better off catching last years tohomade godzilla minus one which grippingly returned to godzillas postwwii origins and in the process won the 70yearold lizard its first oscar other less respectable creatures might have used an academy award as a springboard for more dramatic roles but not godzilla no costume dramas for him unless you count the robotic fist that kong gets outfitted with midway through the movie no we are back in the pure spectacle territory that has traditionally been godzilla and king kongs stomping ground its even a very small title tweak from the previous installment godzilla vs kong to godzilla x kong this one promises a teamup with the frenemies joining forces to fight a mutual foe if things keep up this way we can look forward to godzilla xoxo kong returning director adam wingard kicks things off with his two stars separated like starcrossed lovers with only earths mantle in between godzilla roams above ground while kong romps around in hollow earth to humankind this is a good arrangement that keeps citydestroying rampages to a minimum  though godzillas choice of bed the roman coliseum is surely unpopular among archeologists every movement of each monster is closely tracked digitally the humans in godzilla x kong verge on being bit players  or more like roving sports commentators  who spend most of their time trying to analyze what the goliaths are up to its a lean crew of scientist ilene andrews rebecca hall conspiracyspouting podcaster bernie brian tyree henry and biologist trapper dan stevens who fly into the earths center when kong is hurt and confusing distress signals seem to emanating from the underworld with them are ilenes adoptive daughter jia kaylee hottle the lone surviving member of the tribe that protected kongs skull island being in hollow earth takes some of the fun out of things what good is a colossus when you cant fling it against a skyscraper some of that comes later in godzilla x kong but most of the films thrills come out of the strange dimensions that can turn up around every corner in hollow earth they stumble onto a host of lost civilizations and a cavernous lair held up by giant crystals that look like the roman numerals of a super bowl logo that also leaves godzilla x kong residing in a purely cgi arena without even tenuous connections to reality its a empty chamber for movie spectacle and nothing else where the only option is to pile elements on top of each other until you have you know a giant evil ape swinging a vertebrae like a lasso while riding a kaiju controlled by a crystal but this mostly a very big very simple tag team affair the bad guys underground  the nasty gorilla skar king and equally unpleasant lizard kaiju shimo  eventually battle kong and godzilla in a finale that strips out the last vestige of reality gravity in a floating melee who is there to root for here godzilla has first billing but it spends most of its time traipsing around the globe sucking up radiation of the humans hall does the most to bring something real to the movie kong as hes been throughout this iteration of the franchise is the main guy but hes just on the lookout for a friend or two his most emotional scene like nick nolte in affliction is due to a tooth ache that and the resulting yank via helicopter prompted me to wish the movie was just a series of medical issues for an aging kong a knee replacement some reading glasses godzilla x kong the new empire a warner bros release is rated pg13 by the motion picture association for creature violence and action running time 115 minutes two stars out of four
Mar 29 2024,negative, godzilla x kong the new empire begins with a lonely kong suffering the pain of an infected tooth and the loneliness of being the last of his kind its a good place to start and if the filmmakers had stayed with the big guy on his adventures this would have been a much better flick instead they expanded the action to include the humans from the last film in this franchise never to be confused with the infinitely superior godzilla minus one franchise and things went downhill from there not that some of the humans arent fun certainly dan stevens as trapper the holistic hippie veterinarian in a hawaiian shirt is a delight with his chewy aussie twang and sense of fair play among all living things even mosquitos even better is brian tyree henry as bernie the conspiracist podcaster with a gift for gab who talks himself into unfortunate situations with comic panache again if theyd left it at these characters we would still have had a popcorn flick with some wellearned guffaws and bellylaughs amid those primo special effects alas the star of the piece is an all too solemn rebecca hall hogtied into a role as dr ilene andrews that allows her little more than a flicker of irony and far too much treacle this is especially bad when dealing with dr andrews adopted daughter jia kaylee hottle the last of the iwi people of kongs home skull island that she is also in middle school with all the attendant moodiness does not help though when a girl has gone from protector of kong to algebra i who can blame her for being a little down in the dumps particularly when subjected to psychic visions of a disturbing inchoate nature getting back to kong hes now living in the hollow world safe from annoying godzilla who is topside protecting the world from kaiju like the immense spidery arthropod terrorizing rome but something weird is afoot with electrical anomalies that set off bernies conspiracy alarm and godzilla making a beeline for a nuclear power plant in france to recharge big time but thats not all kong and his magic hatchet have tumbled into the uncharted part of the hollow earth and while he discovers more of his kind it isnt the love fest he might have hoped it would be it all gets very silly very fast with a plot whose main function is to get the humans from point a to point b and to do so without taking away any more time than necessary from the actionpacked effects sequences  did i mention they are great  and not just the actionpacked ones where rio is flattened theres also the sight of godzilla curling up like a kitten in the colosseum after a long day of kaiju fighting and trapper yanking kongs incisor the best effects are in the service of an army of primates animated to such a fine degree that they have more shades of characterization than the poor humans are allowed there are good monkeys and bad monkeys that carry scenes without dialogue and a duplicitous baby one still the same height as a midsize skyscraper with an expressive face and superb body language that will warm your heart and make you want to toss it into a handy lava pit the relationship it strikes up with kong is startlingly complex and easily the most compelling in the story forget dr andrews and jia this is the parentchild relationship worth following and about which you might even want to take a few notes you can do that while the convoluted and contrived plot in which the humans are enmeshed takes place godzilla x kong is an example of where kaiju films go wrong if the plot is silly at least make it lively and internally logical and now the inevitable comparison to godzilla minus one where takashi yamazaki made the kaiju a metaphor that was arch and moving thereby raising the emotional stakes as tokyo crumbles for godzilla x kong that mayhem is the point and the story just so much filling made with artificial color and flavorings to hold it together when there is another sequel in this franchise and heaven help us there will be please i beg you spin off vet and the podcaster and let them romp merrily amid the kaiju
Mar 29 2024,negative, thanks to those of you who have already subscribed after my first post any further support would be much appreciated and just as a reminder the whole newsletter is completely free for now  the monsterverse over at warner bros is a very curious thing indeed we started a decade ago with gareth edwards weirdly coy game of kaiju peekaboo in godzilla followed it with the equally middling kong skull island and then snoozed through the galumphing disaster that was godzilla king of the monsters fortunately for this franchise adam wingards enormously silly godzilla vs kong was exactly what we all needed as we emerged blinking into the open after a year and change of pandemic lockdowns that brings us to wingards return for the bafflingly titled godzilla x kong the new empire it had lots of very difficult questions to answer what else lives in the hollow earth can these two titans coexist what the heck does that x mean some of those questions are answered in the movie  not the one about the x sadly  but it also poses plenty more notably how can a blockbuster film about warring behemoths in a subterranean wonderland be this tedious the story begins with godzilla and kong separated by the divide between worlds lizard boy is waging occasional kaiju wars on the surface while axeman ape is marauding around the hollow earth being a badass thats until kong tumbles down a sinkhole and uncovers an even older civilisation of great apes with less than honourable intentions for the surface world its very much the quigon jinn school of storytelling  theres always a bigger fish unfortunately thats as far as we go in terms of ideas the human characters are even more perfunctory than usual  dan stevens doing aussiecumkiwicummockney is unforgettable in the worst way  and the plot is threadbare even for a movie about giant creatures twatting each other in the face so close to godzilla minus ones oscarwinning revitalisation of kaiju storytelling this feels unforgivable the core problem is that with so much of the story taking place in the cgi environs of the hollow earth the sense of scale is gone are these creatures massive or proportionate how big is the transparent merchandise play diddy kong sorry nintendo when they all fight these guys just look like specks floating in digital space rather than massive tangible beasts capable of doing damage outside of a computer wingard to his credit realises this enough to transplant the third act to rio de janeiro for some crumbly building action but without any sense of the human peril involved  its all banal platitudes about saving the world  it doesnt feel any more physical and important than it did beneath the surface ultimately it feels like theyve just run out of ideas at this point when youve swapped the mothras and the ghidorahs of the world for a villain straight out of the mighty boosh something has gone wrong what if kong was red is not enough of a brainstorm session for a blockbuster with a sixfigure budget godzilla vs kong felt like the rampaging id of this franchise but in attempting to deepen its mythology this new entry has fallen apart weve been asking for more monsters and fewer humans and to be fair wingard delivered that unfortunately he forgot that without humans you need to find another way to inject stakes when this is just an existential war for the survival of a few thousand pixels its really hard to care godzilla and kong wish they could match the titanic status of anne hathaway and jessica chastain watching them go toe to toe on the big screen is akin to a wrestlemania championship match but to be honest its difficult to know what to make of mothers instinct  its cinematic heritage is clear this is one of those theres something twisted behind the white picket fences of suburbia movies so fill in your comparison of choice the stepford wives blue velvet american beauty all the way through to the risible matt damon black comedy suburbicon set in the 1960s it follows the fractured relationship between neighbours céline hathaway and alice chastain after one of them is hit with a terrible tragedy  to say more would be to spoil the surprises of the narrative but ultimately seasoned cinematographer benoît delhommes directorial debut  a remake of a belgian thriller  isnt nearly as twisty as you want it to be initial layers of psychological intrigue and lashings of high camp  i was reminded of the more deliberately overcranked parts of may december  give way to shrieking insanity and not even the fun kind in the third act but despite all of that i had a really good time chastain and hathaway sink every perfectly white tooth in their mouths into sarah conradts intentionally ripe script with hathaway in particular relishing the shifting personas of céline chastains work is necessarily more subdued but her take on a potential victim of murderous gaslighting is very watchable indeed this film might not shock and enthral the way it wants to but theres no denying the intensity of the heavyweight clash between hathaway and chastain thats worth its weight in melodramatic gold i was utterly wowed by sacha polaks first englishlanguage feature dirty god back in 2019 she has reunited with that films star vicky knight for her followup silver haze this time its even more personal for knight as the story is heavily inspired by her own childhood in which she suffered serious burns in a fire at the pub where she lived some of the supporting players are her real family members whats most impressive about silver haze is that its an absolute shapeshifter of a film every time you feel you know what its going to be it changes and morphs into something else orbiting around knights protagonist franky it depicts her search for justice but also her burgeoning romance with one of the patients at the hospital where she works esmé creedmiles then it becomes something else entirely when franky finds another surrogate family ultimately this makes for a bit of a narrative jumble but knight is such a unique screen presence  you want to support franky even when she does awful things  that all of the disparate parts make sense amid her gravitational pull its a more complex film than dirty god  and often a more frustrating mercurial one  but its just as fascinating and fulfilling its well worth catching and you can find out more about the bfis cinema release here last year i watched apple tvs thinky scifi series foundation for the first time with low expectations hard scifi isnt my thing i prefer it soft squishy and more than a little silly but foundation reorientated my take on the genre entirely with its epic tale of cloned emperors and mathematical foresight its now one of my favourite tv shows and im very much hoping the behindthescenes turmoil around season three doesnt hurt it too much so with my newfound love of this sort of thing i decided to give 3 body problem a go on netflix burning through all eight episodes in less than 24 hours i wrote for radio times this week about how its actually very illsuited to binge viewing but i still very much enjoyed the show created by game of thrones showrunners david benioff and db weiss the series is based on the first in a trilogy of scifi novels by computer engineer turned writer cixin liu its a complex tale in which a string of suicides in the scientific community triggers an investigation involving a superadvanced virtual reality game built around the physics conundrum of the title not to mention a pivotal decision made in the wake of the chinese cultural revolution over the course of just eight episodes the show gets through a lot of material the world we leave at the openended conclusion of the series couldnt be more different to the familiar one we join in episode one benioff and weiss know how to do epic 3 body problem never feels like its in a hurry allowing the first half of the series to unfold at a methodical and thoughtful pace before really amping up the spectacle once the truth of the story is unveiled theres one clearly very expensive set piece in episode five that is genuinely one of the most shocking and brutal things ive seen in a tv show for years i almost had to go for a lie down afterwards but the show also very much has characters at its heart jess hong particularly shines as genius physicist jin cheng  thrust into a level of prominence for which she gets no time to prepare  while eiza gonzálezs take on the guilt of nanotech pioneer auggie salazar is heartbreaking meanwhile benedict wong provides a joyously snarky lighter side to proceedings as nononsense mancuian investigator da shi the second half of the series does feel a little overstuffed and at times the shows ambition exceeds its grasp a little but as big idea scifi goes this is deeply impressive in both spectacle and substance unfortunately though this is a netflix bingewatch and so nobody will be talking about it in a weeks time its just the way of the world in conjunction with our amazing graphics and production design team all of whom worked tirelessly to give this film the 70s aesthetic we had always imagined we experimented with ai for three still images which we edited further and ultimately appear as very brief interstitials in the film we feel incredibly fortunate to have had such a talented and passionate cast crew and producing team go above and beyond to help bring this film to life we cant wait for everyone to see it for themselves this weekend the response to this has been weird and actually sort of tribal many people who saw and enjoyed the film prior to this revelation have been keen to defend it against the other camp  those who flatout refuse to see a movie that utilised ai in any way or feel tricked if they paid to see it before they found out  a quick glance at the letterboxd page for late night with the devil shows this duality pretty clearly with the most popular review stating clearly dont let this be the start of accepting this shit in your entertainment my own feelings on this are quite complicated naturally my instinct is to defend the film i absolutely loved it and would hate to see the work of dozens of genuine creatives binned and forgotten because corners were cut in one specific aspect of the project film is a collaborative medium and so i always think its a shame to call for a boycott because of the actions of one member  or a few members  of the team however the creeping influence of ai on our art is absolutely something that needs stamping out in no uncertain terms i completely understand the strength of feeling particularly from those who like me work in industries vulnerable to the rise of ai if people want to draw a red line i get it and i respect it one aspect that i havent seen talked about as much though came to my attention in a twitter exchange between critics eric d snider and phil nobile jr they pointed out that when late night with the devil was made in 2022 ai wasnt seen as quite as harmful as it is now  in fact apps like lensa were very popular using ai to generate stylised avatars for social media as recently as december 2022 dozens of online publications were reporting on the ai avatar trend and nobody seemed all that bothered objections were made but they were fairly quiet in among all of the people sharing pictures of themselves morphed into various high school yearbook archetypes of course this doesnt absolve the filmmakers of responsibility late night with the devil premiered a year ago at the sxsw festival and it would have been easy for those images to have been replaced between then and its wide release but certainly ai wasnt seen as nearly as much of an existentially threatening demon in 2022 the change in attitude since then if anything underscores just how rapid the development of the technology has been the solution to all of this clearly has to come from regulation one of the big achievements of the sag and wga strikes last year was protection for their members from the influence of ai that now has to be passed on to other workers within the tv and film industry including designers and illustrators studios obviously are going to want to cut costs where possible and there does need to be a resistance to that however im not sure completely rubbishing a fairly lowbudget horror film is 100 the answer i think the best solution at this stage is to note the controversy when discussing the film so it doesnt go unnoticed as the films star david dastmalchian said this week its an important conversation we gotta have it but at this stage conversation is better and more useful than condemnation thats it please let me know which bits of this you liked if any and whether or not im wasting my time by trying to make this into something see you same time next week for more reviews opinions and filmy stuff
Mar 29 2024,positive, godzilla and king kong are back in action in a new adventure as they take to the screen in godzilla x kong the new empire im gonna be honest the release of this film comes way too soon following the collapse of the francis scott key bridge in baltimore you and i both know how frequently buildings and infrastructure get destroyed during the course of these films my screening came way too soon after hearing what happened in baltimore this isnt to take anything away from the film itself but to serve as something of a warning during this sensitive time all that notwithstanding i dont ask for much out of these films other than to be entertaining suffice it to say it did its job in that regard while bringing over a few characters from godzilla vs kong the film also introduces trapper dan stevens the dentist to the titans while the film does give viewers some background into trappers character i would love to see a spinoff about his dentistry work with titans the gist of the new monsterverse offering is that our favorite titans must come together to face off against a new threat from an undiscovered world beneath hollow earth the skar king its a threat that will challenge kong as he searches for family but really pisses off godzilla in a way that changes his behavior he starts destroying everything in his path without any regard for life or infrastructure after getting a brief glimpse of hollow earth in the previous installment this new film is about learning about not only its history but what threats it offers meanwhile kong becomes something of a father figure to suko it was bound to happen at some point that they would incorporate son of kong into the storytelling or something like it im hopeful that warner bros and legendary will treat viewers to at least another film featuring the two titans as to what other threats may be out there im not sure what i can say for certain is that the monsterverse is in capable hands with adam wingard at the helm hes already given us two films starring both godzilla and kong i love how he balances the human element with the titans the destruction can be a bit much at times but it is what it is theres also the humor element from both brian tyree henry and dan stevens maybe its because stevens speaks with a british accent or his character is a dentist adam wingard knows what hes doing with godzilla x kong the new empire and its just entertaining enough but seriously though i want a trapper spinoff and stat danielle solzman is native of louisville ky and holds a ba in public relations from northern kentucky university and a ma in media communications from webster university she roots for her beloved kentucky wildcats st louis cardinals indianapolis colts and boston celtics living less than a mile away from wrigley field in chicago she is an active reader sportsentertainmenthistorybiographiesselect fiction and involved with the chicago improv scene she also sees many movies and reviews them she has previously written for redbird rants wildcat blue nation and hidden remoteflicksided from april 2016 through may 2017 her film reviews can be found on creators
Mar 29 2024,positive,director wingard gives us what can plainly be described as a fun classic saturday matinee
Mar 29 2024,negative, considering the massive stature of the titular beasts its remarkable how the sequel godzilla x kong the new empire actually feels bigger than its predecessors whether its better is a different argument this latest entry in the effectsdriven monster mashup franchise after godzilla vs kong has plenty of kaiju set pieces to thrill series devotees without advancing the mythology in any meaningful way the film opens with king kong peacefully sequestered beneath the planets surface in hollow earth while erstwhile nemesis godzilla minds his business among the pintsized humans as long as they dont venture into each others territories weve got nothing to worry about reasons a scientist rebecca hall basically in charge of making sure that doesnt happen but it does of course thanks to some agitation from other behemoths seeking world domination including a formidable primate known as skar king who pushes kongs buttons and a highly charged undersea reptile who lures godzilla into a trap there are other human characters too some of which are holdovers they include a conspiracy blogger brian tyree henry trying to secure followers an explorer dan stevens whose thirst for adventure comes in handy and a deaf girl kaylee hottle with a mysterious past whos a conduit of sorts to kong their collective role is to look bewildered and helpless spout pseudoscientific nonsense and act as de facto narrators to translate the grunts and roars for nonfluent moviegoers all the brawls on the undercard cause some loyalties to shift and lead into an obligatory largescale finale that triggers catastrophes on both sides of the earths crust on the terrestrial side such landmarks as the colosseum the rock of gibraltar and the egyptian pyramids are part of the collateral damage returning director adam wingard and his crew deserve credit for some elaborate world building and meticulous creature design its a marvelous collection of computergenerated visuals a loud and proud exercise in spectacle over substance the otherwise silly film delivers the goods with an abundance of slowmotion titan clashes that convey a visceral intensity however despite halfhearted attempts to connect on a deeper emotional level its almost impossible to muster any significant rooting interest in characters of any species with its expansion of the goliath roster the new empire feels more like a bridge to future installments or the battle before a war thats yet to materialize
Mar 29 2024,neutral, would you eat from a sensible veggie tray when a chocolate éclair is right next to it would you settle in council bluffs when omaha is mere miles away would you be a huge superman fan when spiderman exists of course not nor would you center king kong in your narrative over godzilla because you have excellent taste unlike the deciders behind godzilla x kong the new empire we get a multiplication symbol in the latest title in the series which is only odd because it follows the release of godzilla minus one i guess its true what they say forget sex math sells baby unlike the sincere melodrama of minus one gxk is epic goofballery that is mostly fine except that it spends way too much time on the oversized gorillas lonely wallowing and nowhere near enough time on the atomicbreathing megalizard who represents the promise and peril of the nuclear era king kong sad because him no have friends will just never be more interesting than godzillas will theywont they sexual tension with mothra let alone other bigger metaphorical issues connected to the cultural icon anyway this whole dumb thing is about kong finding a hidden hollow part of the already hidden hollow earth they found in the last movie theres a bunch more big apes in the newly found hole one of them is mean and keeps an icebreathing dragon on a chain while kong processes his feelings about befriending a baby giant gorilla godzilla is on the earths surface fighting to defend humanity against hordes of evil monsters no its fine kong you make some friends while the gman keeps the planet alive the human subplot is commendably almost nonexistent dan stevens is a hilarious hippie kaiju veterinarian rebecca hall isi want to say a scientist shes been in these before but i cant remember where vera farmigas godzilla character stopped and halls started theres some maybeuncomfortable stuff about a lost tribe that comes pretty close to the gross native populations are literally made of magic trope brian tyree henry plays a likeable podcaster which is a character more fantastical than the aforementioned ice dragon things are constantly happening in the movie that much can be confirmed its actually fine that they dont really amount to much plotwise as nobody is hoping for christopher nolanian exposition the problem here is really the same thing that has given marvels superheroes heavy boots these days the need to constantly up the stakes now feels somehow less interesting obviously the sheer size of the characters involved necessitates a big problem to solve but this feels less like an epic disaster spectacle and more like the obligatory comic book sequel that rolls out a new scarred evil doer with a generic army of baddies some of the visuals work stevens is a delight i treasure the multiple shots of godzilla sleeping in the roman colosseum like it was a doggy bed but it is all too effervescent in its entertainment all fizzy fuzzy cgi without metaphor or meaning this is what you get when you hitch your wagon to what is basically the hulk in need of a haircut instead of a living incarnation of humanitys scientific folly this is a carrot dipped in ranch not custardfilled goodness this is not the good life butwhatever iowas motto is caitlin clark plays here maybe this is not with great power comes great responsibility but up up and away from your memory amy nicholson at the washington post says wingards not a sentimentalist and godzilla x kong stumbles whenever he tries to slap phony emotions onto the film to make it more like a generic crowdpleaser hes a showman a popcorn guy with excellent aesthetics let james cameron give his avatar organisms biological plausibility wingard just wants to tint one monster hot pink another one gold and another the opalescent shimmer of a 12yearolds first bottle of nail polish radheyan simonpillai at the globe and mail says for all the buildup toward a slugfest between godzilla kong outfitted with a new mechaarm some surprise allies and an army raised from the earths core this one is egregiously dull its just a bunch of cartoonish limbs flailing with bursts of fireballs and beams lacking any of the graceful or exhilarating movements that a little human choreography could have helped with charles pulliammoore at the verge says those hoping for the film to establish a way for the franchise to keep evolving may be disappointed because its difficult to imagine where legendary takes the titans from here the studio probably doesnt want this to be the monsterverses last chapter but going out with a big absurd pinkhued bang might not be the worst thing for godzilla and his axwielding friend
Mar 29 2024,neutral,weve seen that there are ways to do this sort of thing very well unfortunately godzilla x kong is satisfied to simply give us more of the same old beasts
Mar 29 2024,positive, if you struggle to remember what happened in 2021s pandemicfrustrated theatrical and streaming release of godzilla vs kong you are not alone and viewers who got bogged down in the dramainfused apple tv limited series monarch legacy of monsters need not worry about playing catchup before taking in this new theatrical installment overarching plot coherence and continuity arent a priority for director adam wingard and his the new empire team the goal for this entry is monsteronmonster devastation and on a purely brainless entertainment level theres nothing wrong with that this monster movie installment is a marginal improvement over 2021s godzilla vs kong still the new empires heavily animated weightless special effects cant hold a candle to recent oscar winner godzilla minus one and empires story if you can call it a story is minus any attempt to be coherent or emotionally engaging tender moments are few and far between as skyscrapers tumble to dust taking potentially millions of lives in the destructive process theres nary a dull or quiet moment in the new empire a bombastic monster movie that should come with a breakfast cereal box warning that it lacks any nutritional value this entry picks up in the years since the discovery of the subterranean world known as the hollow earth this underground wicked paradise is where titans rule and occasionally find their way to the surface where they wreak havoc however to combat the escaped creatures humans managed to cultivate a relationship with mortal enemies godzilla and kong to prevent the two from fighting and demolishing every major city on the globe kong has been banished to the hollow earth while the unruly godzilla roams freely topside whenever another titan a monster of enormous size emerges godzilla acts as our planets protector by using his great strength and nuclear breath to vanquish dangerous forces but when a chasm opens in kongs new basement dwelling a fresh group of monsters step forth will kong and godzilla join forces to save the day any fan will already know the answer to that question after all the title gives it away but the fun is in watching kong and godzilla duke it out with each other and take on a colorful assortment of strange creatures the silly selfaware performances by actors dan stevens and brian tyree henry help sell the films goofy tone their rolling commentary as the epic battles dominate acts as a good contrast against rebecca halls straitlaced scientist the problem here is the lack of any serious stakes possibly millions perish as the monsters destroy major cities which is met with a slew of empty jokes gone is the pathos introduced in the opening sequence of 2014s godzilla which started this new series of monster movies in giving up and giving into the base temporary glee evoked when kong repeatedly punches his skyscrapersized opponent or those initially exhilarating moments when godzillas nuclear breath is sprayed onto a fellow threatening kaiju studios warner bros and legendary entertainment shoot for lowhanging fruit when they should be aiming higher
Mar 29 2024,positive, for better or worse godzilla x kong the new empire feels much more like the movie director adam wingard  who now also totes executive producer and story credits  wanted to make when he was directing godzilla vs kong  gone is the responsibility of fulfilling contracts for legacy characters from the previous two films like millie bobby brown kyle chandler and alexander skarsgård the human cast is pared down focused on delivering exposition between monster fights wingard staple dan stevens shows up as the male lead just having a good time the soundtrack is a blend of popsong needledrops and electronic synths courtesy of junkie xl and antonio di iorio the violence here is fast furious and surprisingly graphic  befitting a director who started in indie horror and has worked his way over the last decade into the blockbuster space it lovingly harkens back to earlier films while feeling like its own distinct approach to the monstermash style of kaiju adventure compared to its predecessor gxk feels like a story someone was excited to tell with the means to tell it their way all of that sounds good on paper and indeed much of it is perfectly fine on screen but i cant shake the feeling that wingards sensibilities and my sensibilities are not a great fit when it comes to this sort of film like godzilla vs kong this is basically a scifi kong movie with godzilla strapped in for action sequences and occasional bits of tension the subterranean hollow earth is explored here and in fact we find out it has its own underlayers all of the remaining human cast members are principally concerned with kong rebecca hall returns as dr ilene andrews who is now the head of the scientific research organization monarch her adopted daughter jia kaylee hottle continues to have a connection with kong they bring conspiracytheory podcaster bernie brian tyree henry along for the ride and hes just as annoying as ever the aforementioned stevens shows up as trapper a veterinarian to the titans the name given to the kaiju in these films stevens introduction has a sense of scale and livedin worldbuilding found in 2014s godzilla kong skull island and 2019s godzilla king of the monsters  the first three monsterverse films  but generally lacking in wingards previous film the humans are led to the hollow earth in pursuit of a signal only jia can pick up likewise kong is on his own journey searching for any other apes that might exist in the world below godzilla can sense the signal and starts traveling around the world searching for powerups these arcs barely intersect and the introduction of the main villains  skar king a large red orangutan and shimo an icebreathing titan  takes far far too long in the meantime the two titular titans get plenty of action beats fighting a variety of creatures who stand in the way of their respective missions these fights have diminishing returns because many of their foes have names even when they do they dont have personalities even the dumbest villains in the worst old godzilla films from the 1960s had names and seemed to want something even if that was to just be jerks have you ever heard of ebirah some would say hes just a lobster and sure thats what he is but hes also a gradea jerk that goes a long way for me and for whatever reason it just takes wingards script ages to ever arrive at the point where we meet skar king when we do its immediately clear hes a lightweight villain this is after all the series that brought in king ghidorah with an apocalypse aesthetic in the second film its never clear why skar king is a threat to the surface world or frankly a threat to either kong or godzilla hes a big angry ape with a whip without the help of his enslaved shimo hes a total nobody my issues with pacing wouldnt sit at the forefront of my mind if i felt like wingard nailed the biggest moments but he approaches filmmaking with what i can only describe as an addaddled mindset i know where hes coming from were in the same generational cohort his use of needledrops is excessive but i understand it his love for throwback visual choices is ridiculous but i respect it its the add of it all though wingard rarely holds a shot although its pretty great when he does and the action is so fast so busy so delirious that it starts to become headacheinducing even when kong is simply fighting other apes things almost move at a blur whats interesting is that my 5year old the target audience for this stuff feels basically the same way about the wingard films ive never led him on i dont want him to dislike something hes just never been able to connect with godzilla vs kong due to its extremely choppy pacing and difficulty establishing a tone he felt similarly about this one especially the earlier parts that lean into villainous ape henchmen the movie feels erratic thats not a problem in most of the other movies in this longrunning franchise which are often slower than they should be sometimes patience is a virtue lest it seem like i disliked godzilla x kong the new empire more than its predecessor well at least this one has some sense of style to it even if it doesnt work for me there are quite a few great moments at the end when wingard allows them a few seconds to breathe before moving on to the next scene on paper this is a lot of what i want from this series that is if i cant ever again have anything as good as godzilla king of the monsters kongs beast glove is really cool shimo has a great design godzilla and kong becoming friends thanks to an intervention from an old friend is really lovely to me its a wonder we got this film only a few months after godzilla minus one delivered a great serious take on the character and gave plenty of film critics an excuse to be pretentious about godzilla without actually watching the older films there are many different types of godzilla stories and this leans heavily into the mashup movies of the late 1960s and early 1970s beware any critics who want to tell you the problems with gxk rest with how it depicts the characters faults aside wingard knows what hes doing and its a valid approach i just wish his style clicked with me
Mar 29 2024,neutral, its curious that godzilla received top billing in godzilla x kong the new empire because this fifth installment in legendary pictures monsterverse is really king kongs movie actually the movie features a whole host of giant apes but many of them dont have kongs sweet disposition the monsterverse is the film franchise in which mighty titans roam the earth and humans scramble through the streets trying to stay out of the way but where do these monsters come from the hollow earth of course godzilla x kong opens with monarch the titantracking government agency beginning to explore the realm of hollow earth but anxiety levels spike when sensors detect an electromagnetic signal emanating from the mysterious land monarchs also concerned because at the same time godzilla starts acting strange dr ilene andrews rebecca hall heads down to hollow earth to solve the mystery of the strange signal her team includes a military man alex ferns a titantending veterinarian dan stevens a podcaster brian tyree henry and ilenes adopted teenage daughter kaylee hottle im not sure which strains credulity more the existence of a hollow earth or the makeup of the crew for this reconnaissance mission in the subterranean realm the team learns that a clan of giant apes led by a wicked king plans to ravage the surface stopping the invasion proves too much for kong to handle on his own hell need a little help from his human friends and godzilla last year the japanese film godzilla minus one proved that a monster movie can contain compelling human drama alas thats not the case with godzilla x kong the new empire some of the scenes involving our human explorers elicit a chuckle or two but the group dynamics feel like a warmed over rendering of those in the original jurassic park in this case however the characters are trying to get into trouble rather than escape it which makes no sense every time they stumble across a situation that would cause any rightthinking person to turn around they charge ahead but fans dont go to godzilla and kong movies expecting finely tuned plots they go for the monsters and godzilla x kong has those in abundance as ive already noted kong is the star of this movie and even though he doesnt speak he manages to inject more pathos into this film than any of his human costars the thoughtful visage of the computergenerated giant ape moves from weariness to confidence throughout the film and his interactions with other monsters provide some silent humor godzilla on the other hand is harder to read were told an intelligence guides him but the enormous radioactive lizard seems unaware of the destruction he leaves behind theres a measure of fun in watching giant monsters duke it out but when the fight moves to an urban center like cairo rome or rio de janeiro part of my mind gets distracted by the property damage and number of lives lost i suppose every godzilla movie needs street scenes of people running every which way and shots of the fearsome reptile knocking over buildings but this wanton disregard for human life causes some cognitive dissonance pulling me out of the action seventy years ago when godzilla was a villain it was fine for him to level a city but this version of the king of the monsters is supposed to be a hero no matter in this movie both the good guys and the bad guys plow through cityscapes indiscriminately perhaps the urban devastation is a metaphor implying that humans arent the masters of nature that we believe ourselves to be but when i consider godzilla x kongs relatively weak plot i start to doubt the filmmakers intended any deeper meaning collin is worlds arts and culture editor he is a graduate of the world journalism institute the southern baptist theological seminary and louisiana state university and resides with his wife and four children in sugar land texas
Mar 29 2024,positive, ever since the wider world caught wind of it godzilla x kong the new empire never made any secret of where its interests laid to be a big flashy overthetop brawl involving among others the two undisputed heavyweights of monster movie history  this generations all monsters attack if you will the fearlessness with which the film owns that distinction has delighted some and turned off others and neither of those responses are invalid on the one hand theres no more important item on a films checklist than figuring out your identity and sticking by it whether or not that identity has much merit and lets face it giant monster fights are some of the most carnal undiluted fun you can have in genre fiction on the other hand its hard to disagree that a titanstuffed slugfest seems like a massive downgrade from godzilla and king kongs thematically cerebral roots that is godzilla as a nuclear allegory and for kong the dangers of natural spectacle and the utilitarian side of love indeed even if blasting these two monsters with the current iteration of the hollywood franchise ray didnt outrightly ruin them the new empire should have never been a film truly worthy of any score higher than in this case three and a half out of five stars read that again it should have never on paper this movie had no right to challenge the ceiling that its monster genre identity placed upon it and yet somehow someway a brilliant granular glimmer shone in the new empires eye and despite not taking enough advantage of it hence why its still pressing against said ceiling rather than smashing through it this glimmer should earn a tip of the hat from even the films most rancid doubters lets get the obvious out of the way first the new empire is about a bunch of monsters fighting each other goodandevil style and the scenes where a bunch of monsters are fighting each other goodandevil style are the meat of the triumph here each earthshaking confrontation boasts at least one of three winning elements dazzling evocation bombastically entertaining choreography and peculiarly effective humor and more often than not there are at least two of these aspects involved the undisputable highlight of the film is a zerogravity battle between team godzillakong and team skar kingshimo plus a few extra faces on either side which takes those first two elements and utilizes them to supremely crackling effect that being said there are a few exchanges of punches and energy beams that could have been played to much better effect with kongs difficult recruitment of godzilla being the prime example for context at one point in the film kong returns to the surface world to bring godzilla back to hollow earth so he can help kong fight skar king and his army but godzilla rolls up swinging no doubt hoping for a salty runback after trading a few blows with godzilla to the beat of a stentorian background symphony kong becomes fed up with godzillas nonsense and eventually incapacitates the reptilian titan before dragging him to the hollow earth portal godzilla regains consciousness however and aims a blast of his newlyacquired pink atomic energy at kong ultimately prolonging the fight now the film frequently and quite deliberately plays itself for laughs but this fight wasted a massive opportunity to play with convention by treating this bout as a somewhat epic battle courtesy of the orchestral soundtrack the film deprives it of the chance to really express itself in the way that its textual presentation suggests it wants to namely kong and godzilla humorously and unceremoniously slapping each other around a bit before kong basically goes listen bud i dont like you either but youre coming with me whether you like it or not and were gonna solve this new problem so behave before flippantly dragging godzilla to wherever kong needs him to be furthermore concluding the fight at that point would have allowed for a much bigger more exciting reveal of godzillas new powers by saving them until the final confrontation the human characters in the new empire serve an important purpose make no mistake to lay the expositional and logistical groundwork to set up all of these giant monster fights that said the film both knows this all too well and forgets this a bit too often  when the likes of rebecca hall brian tyree henry and dan stevens serve monologues on titan history upgrading kong or explaining why if a happens then b will happen the new empire is on its strongest footing its when the film tries to involve us in a vague impression of a motherdaughter emotional core or when henrys bernie hayes stretches his role as comic relief in name alone that the new empire proves it needed a bit more time in the oven to truly become its best self a movie should demand excellence from what it excels at but in its family drama and awkward spoken zingers the films comedy is only ever truly effective when it comes by way of the monsters the new empire falls far short of excellence given this context the human characters being in service of the monsters and their antics is an absolute necessity and its that mostlyincompletebutneverthelesspresent intention that gives the new empire the potential to be a genuinely fantastic movie godzilla and king kong have long since outgrown the constraints of their more erudite origins especially as characters of the new empire and exist exactly as unchained intelligent topofthefoodchain beasts would as animals with a commitment to nature be that their own their kin or the natural world itself a human watching classic king kong films might be concerned with how king kong as an abstraction represents love and spectacle king kong himself isnt concerned though nor does godzilla spare even a shadow of a thought of how he parallels atomic devastation theyre instead thinking this is bad and dangerous i need to fight it as any animals would and what is the new empire if not a bunch of monstrous animals fighting what theyre sensing as bad and dangerous thus by placing its human characters almost entirely in service of this monstercentric story the new empire restores kong and godzilla not as oneoff cinematic case studies but as infinitely more mythological wild beings who are beyond human control and comprehension indeed we humans with our media literacy and academia are no longer in control of these two  theyve stepped into a much more independent truth befitting of allpowerful forces of nature godzilla x kong the new empire is a fun brisk popcorn movie despite not using all the tools at its disposal and not always having the right idea about which tool to use nevertheless its beyond proficient with the tool it needs the most and works from a blueprint for something pretty incredible worst case scenario youll dislike the film despite knowing exactly what youre getting into at which point its your fault for watching it in the first place best case scenario you walk away satisfied potentially hyped and even surprised at what it managed to be
Mar 29 2024,negative, theres no weight to anything in godzilla x kong the new empire certainly no figurative weight  this tagteam adventure for the most iconic giant monsters of movieland has all the gravitas of a toy commercial but no physical weight either though its marquee attractions loom like mountains we never feel their footsteps in our bones never get the tingling sensation that something impossibly heavy stands before us at one point the big beasts crash through the egyptian pyramids  those ancient wonders of architectural ingenuity  and we might as well be watching a sandcastle blow away its all so flimsy this expensive eyesore this gimcrack nothing of a blockbuster has the misfortune of arriving in the immediate aftermath of the newly minted oscar winner godzilla minus one now there was a kaiju movie exciting and soulful it brought its 70yearold marquee attraction back to his roots as a terrifying allegory for postwar japan godzilla x kong the new empire the latest in the big guys parallel hollywood franchise is more like the frivolous toho monster smackdowns of the 1970s when godzilla had become a jokey kidfriendly defender of humanity at least those movies had some actual weight to them  as in the kind carried by real stuntmen in real suits stomping on real models here everything onscreen is a digital mirage a cluster of 0s and 1s lumbering across a glittering backdrop of the same the previous movie in the series surprise pandemic hit godzilla vs kong was no great shakes either but it had the advantage of leaning on its vegas fightpromoter hype  the promise of two colossal headliners whaling on each other for the first time in half a century the new empire lacks even that hook nor does it much capitalize on the promise of these frenemies begrudgingly joining forces though that little x in the title is supposedly silent it might as well be a slash given the little screen time the reptile and ape share most of the new empire unfolds across hollow earth aka the vernian lost world at the center of our own which was discovered by the scientists of the last movie with its gaudy multicolored foliage and flocks of pterodactyl the place suggests what pandora might look like if james cameron spent only a long weekend rendering it while director gareth edwards shot the first entry in this reboot series mostly on location augmenting real landscapes with effects afterwards the new empire has the flat antiimmersive scenery of a movie made almost entirely on a soundstage draped in green screen picking up where godzilla vs kong left off the plot is nonsense even by the standards of movies aimed at 8yearolds of all ages it hinges on kong long believed to be the last of his kind stumbling upon a tribe of fellow massive apes in an uncharted stretch of hollow earth these distant relatives include an aggressively cute toddler of mighty joe young proportions as well as the movies villain a crimsoncolored antikong who wields a chainlike melee weapon and plots to mount an attack on the world above because  well does an evil giant ape really need motive still one might wish returning director adam wingard the guest spared even a moment on kongs desire for belonging long scenes of chestbeating territorial conflict evoke planet of the apes but without the well humanity andy serkis has lent his primate characters this is as it might be clear more of a king kong movie than a godzilla movie that focal point makes sense the ape is the more expressive character  and by dint of his sharedancestor lineage easier to project upon but where does that leave tohos finest mostly running errands on the periphery edwards used the gman sparingly too  it remains a point of contention for fans  but he made each appearance count wingard cant seem to find much for godzilla to do before the inevitable fisticuffs climax he curls up for a quick nap in the colosseum and gets his spikes done emerging with spiffy hotpink radioactive highlights who knew a 400foot dinosaur could look bored as for the humans theyre a motley assortment of new and returning spectators the once more sprawling ensemble has been whittled down to an earnest scientist rebecca hall a jaunty veterinarian dan stevens a neurotic comicrelief podcaster causeways brian tyree henry and the last daughter of skull island kaylee hottle whose orphanhood mirrors kongs can you really blame millie bobby brown among others for jumping ship theres little for an actor to do in these movies but spout pseudoscience or quips while godzilla minus one proved it was possible to care about the people in a giantmonster movie the new empire cant even be bothered to make it seem like the performers are occupying the same universe as their cgi costars never once do they convincingly interact with the monsters they wont shut up about not that the kaiju stuff is any better the underwhelming effects give you new appreciation for what godzilla minus one did at a fraction of the cost and the spectacle succumbs to what we might now call the quantumania problem shrinking away the fun of the material by removing any sense of scale whats the point of making a movie about creatures of skyscraper stature if youre not going to emphasize their size through contrast setting the action primarily within a jungle landscape away from throngs of puny humans misplaces the lizardbrain appeal of a godzilla movie even when the action shifts to a metropolitan arena wingard deflatingly opts for medium shots that fail to convey just how damn large these warring titans are meant to be edwards knew better for all his 2014 godzilla divisively denied the audience instant gratification it was a triumph of scale by shooting the carnage from the ground and framing it through a terrified civilian perspective he made the monsters look unfathomably massive  and in their computergenerated way almost real too the sequels supposedly course correcting away from the restraint of that franchiselaunching hit have delivered bigger doses of prehistoric combat the dumb fun we were said to have been deprived but theyve also tacked steadily away from anything resembling grandeur the new

dont care if they keep spending hundreds of millions of dollars making more godzilla movies ive already seen the best there is no fluff piece of toy marketing last years oscarwinning godzilla minus one was a real film with artistry symbolism and epic drama but the cinematic gears have to roll on feeding the starmaker machinery as joni mitchell once said into theaters this week lumbers godzilla x kong the new empire designed as a sequel to 2021s godzilla vs kong the plot centers on another kaiju crisis that erupts from skull island just as humanity has come to believe in godzilla as their savior and kong the bully on the block both have been monitored by the scientists of monarch a covert organization that keeps track of the earths titans after the defeat of mechagodzilla much of the monsterverse franchise is dependent on the hollow earth theory a belief that our planet has a vast underground chamber at the center this is where a mysterious signal is being emitted that has been picked up by young jia kaylee hottle the deaf daughter of monarch scientist ilene andrews rebecca hall it is during investigation of this signal in hollow earth that it is discovered to be inhabited by a variety of gigantic creatures including a population of monstrous apes as you would expect the rivalry between kong and godzilla dissolves as a common enemy appears in the form of a gigantic ape who has been keeping a powerful monster captive using pain a movie that feels like it was rendered entirely from marketing surveys godzilla x kong is noisy and confusing its script by three different writers and directed by adam wingard who did the prequel godzilla vs kong 2021 serves as a clunky way to connect the dots between epic beatdowns featuring massive destruction and presumably horrific loss of life for humans in their way at least mothra makes an appearance i always thought this was one of the better monsters in this universe as for the human actors rebecca hall kaylee hottle dan stevens brian tyree henry and fala chen did their best but their work tends to be overwhelmed by the need to keep the titans duking it out based on a new york times bestselling novel by karen

Mar 29 2024,positive,absolute absurd popcorn fun the most silly trippy rockem sockem entertaining installment yet in the monsterverse the kong  godzilla tag team rumble is worth the ticket full review in spanish
Mar 29 2024,negative, every one of the recent english language kaiju epics from legendary pictures has walked a different path and godzilla x kong the new empire continues the tradition this one is a direct sequel to 2021s godzilla vs kong a simple movie inspired by the 1962 toho studios film king kong vs godzilla that pitted the big lizard and the big ape against each other before teaming them against a robot foe but rather than just repeat the template in the new empire returning director adam wingard and his two cowriters offer a more fragmented and sometimes knowingly silly narrative crosscutting between lines of action in multiple locations that all lead to a huge showdown with a lot of creatures  artistically its the most hitandmiss entry in the current monsterverse lacking the cohesive and distinctive vibe that powered all of the others whether it was the 2014 godzilla basically close encounters of the godzilla kind kong skull island a bizarro riff on vietnam movies godzilla king of the monsters the first teamup entry with lots of family melodrama stirred in or wingards original gloriously goofy godzillakong flick which owed quite a bit to 1960s exploration scifi like journey to the center of the earth and 1980s hong kong and american action thrillerbuddy films where the two main guys have to have a fistfight before they team up against a dangerous villain  rebecca halls anthropologist ilene andrews is the main character this time tending to her adoptive daughter jia kaylie hottle and trying to figure out the connection between mysterious energy pulses detected on the monarch projects monstermeasuring tech and frenzied drawings that jia has been scrawling on school desks and scratch paper the answeruncovered with help from muckrakerconspiracy podcaster bernie hayes brian tyree henry another character from the last movieis a return to the close encounters with godzilla notion positing that what theyre all experiencing is a combination distress signal and warning about an impending catastrophe as intimated in trailers and other promotional material theres a secret civilization of giant konglike primates imprisoned in an unexplored portion of hollow earth plotting their escape and a takeover of the surface world their leader is a scarred and sadistic despot who enslaves his own kind in a mining operation in a hellish volcanic cavern a set that confirms the filmmakers have seen indiana jones and the temple of doom more than once  as somebody whos been a booster of this franchise from the beginning its my sad duty to report that godzilla x kong is all over the place barely working up a proper head of steam before cutting to something else it makes king of the monsters seem singlemindedly onmessage and its even more larded with redundant and wooden make sure that everybody in the audience understands everything thats happening at all times exposition than the previous films the showdowns are rousing and often brilliantly choreographed particularly the finale a multiplemonster main event with lots of other creatures bustling around in the margins the liveaction and motion capture performances are mostly marvelous despite the bum dialogue and wingards tendency to rush through sequences and whole relationships that mightve been extraordinary had they been presented with patience and elegance  dan stevens is a pleasant though functionally absurd addition to the cast he plays a swashbuckling poetryquoting exboyfriend of ilene whos famous for being the first and so far only kaiju veterinarian and is introduced extracting an abscessed tooth from kongs mouth by rappelling down into it from a hovercraft i dont know if it was shakespeare or freud who said that a man with a toothache cannot be in love but this movie offers a corollary a giant ape with a toothache cannot defend the surface world stevens has real chemistry with henry whose dialogue often sounds adlibbed even if it wasnt there are times when they seem like theyre at risk of cracking each other up and blowing a take but the movie fails to take advantage of their connection and build it into something truly memorable  kongs relationship with a bigeyed little scamp of an ape that he meets while exploring hollow earth is a much bigger missed opportunity although the bits we do see are performed by motion capture performers and the fx teams with imagination and care the younger ape is essentially an abused child who is treacherous selfish and cowardly because he grew up in a cult he suddenly now has a good parenting model courtesy of kong a hairy burly single dude who lives a solitary existence is an orphan himself and had no parent role models at least not that we know of yet still treats the younger ape with patience and compassion even when its not earned and makes a decent primate out of him adam sandler has told a version of this tale many times as presented here its a mirror of whats happening between ilene and jiathe latter reconnecting with her own roots and ilene growing increasingly sad at the possibility that the girl might outgrow the need for her two adoptive parents two different sets of challenges but the same basic story so much couldve been done but wasnt more for the minus column the computer generated creature skins look more cartoony than in previous entries and the screenplay introduces its genuinely terrifying and charismatic villain skar king too late to give him and kong a chance to build and flesh out their antagonism as the preceding movie did with kong and godzillas relationship its fascinating to watch the slow revelation of kongs value system and realize how starkly it contrasts with the behavior of his evil doppelganger a swaggering preening rotter who seems to have been played via time warp by gary oldman in the 90s kongs triumph here should have felt cathartic a victory of decency over despotic cruelty rather than narrative boxchecking  the whole film needed more ape content really its the stuff that really hits the movie doesnt seem to recognize how powerful it is a more smartly prioritized film might have focused on the vividly rendered and characterized apes and the humans that follow them around perhaps to the exclusion of godzilla who is treated here mainly as a mayhemproducing force that the movie cuts to regularly because the film has godzilla in the title he does have his moments though like using a prowrestling suplex to slam an adversary and sleeping curled up in the roman colosseum like its the worlds largest dog bed if you love the what the hell lets try it sensibility that the legendary pictures monster franchise has embraced thus far youll still find plenty here to enjoy but it shouldnt have been necessary to go looking for it matt zoller seitz is the editor at large of rogerebertcom tv critic for new york magazine and vulturecom and a finalist for the pulitzer prize in criticism
Mar 29 2024,negative, taking away the hook of what made godzilla vs kong somewhat engaging adam wingards followup forgoes a clash of titans in favor of a convoluted sequel that features poorly rendered cgi which blown on up on an imaxsized screen shows just how far the mighty have fallen perhaps we were spoiled when godzilla minus one a japanese import from toho studios that took the radioactive lizard to soaring new highs reinvigorated interest in a character who has headlined 30 movies over the last three decades alas godzilla x kong the new empire is a digital slugfest without much punch or emotional levity the human characters especially poor rebecca hall are used for no other purpose than to exposition dump and are completely ineffective to the plot something minus one did not struggle with  ditching the vs in the title all but confirmed we werent going to see the two prominent poster children in the monsterverse saga duke it out for total supremacy which means there must be something worthy enough for them to emerge from hollow earth a sanctuary they roam freely but doing this means establishing a framework of lore and mythology that becomes so entangled within itself the movie becomes vapor a passing mist that evaporates as soon as it enters your eyeballs  it sees scientist iiene andrews hall and her adopted daughter jia kaylee hottle who can communicate with kong unearth a disturbance deep into the surface of hollow earth with no real explanation as to why but its probably got something to do with the fact kong has been going bananas and godzilla is being lured to various landmarks around the world trying to solve the issue iiene enlists conspiracy podcaster bernie brian tyree henry  once again demoted to being the token comedic relief and monster veterinarian trapper dan stevens  sporting a hawaiian shirt and about the only beacon of enjoyment in this mostly joyless affair to traverse into the unknown realms of the artificial planet in the hopes of understanding whats got these titans all wound up  turns out kong isnt the only giant ape alive and though we hear a narration about his constant search for long lost relatives and the need for companionship the ones he stumbles upon are uh not very nice and they serve a leader known as the scarking who also happens to conveniently imprison a godzillalike creature for reasons hall explains in one of those mind boggling exposition monologues of which there are many dont even think about keeping up so with conventional human characters we didnt even really discuss the forced motherdaughter relationship nor the cheesy jokes and lame special effects godzilla x kong the new empire sinks the franchise to new lows a stoic monstermashup that has buckets of destruction some of historical landmarks in rome cairo and rio de janeiro and not a single ounce of imagination perhaps these two behemoths need to sit down and work out their differences so we dont have to be subjected to another bloated actionadventure thats got no sense of purpose
