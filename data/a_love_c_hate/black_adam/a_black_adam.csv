Mar 15 2024,positive,was definitely watchable but needed a better script and characters
Feb 29 2024,positive,i disliked the fact a dad who  lost a son would feel hatred and arrogance knowing his son wouldnt want him like that also at the end spoiler alert why have superman instead of the one who is supposed to be the arch enemy shazam show up other than these issues it was a decent movie

Feb 17 2024,negative,oh boy how do i explain this a film that has heart but doesnt have soul the action looks good on paper but when it all comes together i just couldnt care humor missed 100 of the time for me only good for people who have to complete the whole dc story or for rock fans the end credit scene was wellintended but since this movie universe has ended it just hurts seeing the wasted potential
Feb 15 2024,positive,its simply a film for relaxation well it offers good fighting sequences eyecatching visuals and plenty of action scenes however in terms of content meaning or the ending is it a new superhero for us to look forward to theres nothing more to it just constant crushing banging and fighting sounds echoing in my ears

Dec 24 2023,positive,it is a very okay movie
Dec 24 2023,negative,i wouldnt say im a big fan of these types of films but i am a fan of dwayne johnson so i was really looking forward to this as i followed him and how hard he trained for the role that was meant for him however the film is pants he looks great and theres action but the script is awful just didnt drag me in and get lost in a film type of film at all really disappointed and sadly couldnt even watch to the end it was so poor and boring and very cheesy in parts
Dec 22 2023,positive,i dont know why i heard trash talk about this movie my kids and i loved it thoroughly entertained
Dec 22 2023,negative,honestly the movie just had way to many stories to tell heros we knew very little about it was a one watch wonder
Dec 21 2023,negative,pretty bad not going to lie but it at least was funny because of how hyped the ga was to see this after more than a decade of waiting
Dec 20 2023,positive,was better than expected id say its on the level of man of steel on rating among the better ones dc has released being an antihero main character is great definitely excited on the next installment also other reviewers seem to be too harsh nowadays
Dec 20 2023,negative,too much action with very little actual storytelling this is basically two hours of people just beating each other up albeit there are some legitimately funny gags sprinkled in throughout but that doesnt save the movie couldnt recommend
Dec 19 2023,positive,wow talk about one big ole mishmash of cgi
Dec 19 2023,negative,i love the whole superhero genre of films and tv series not the actual print comics per se and not the animated stuff but the films the movies the one with humans metas and superheroes on screen    that whole torturedsoul personaldemonstoovercome lifeisntautomaticallyeasywhenyoureasuperhero thing works for me well that and the worlds they live in    two of my my recent favorites are doom patrol and pennyworth even the minor characters in pennyworth are delightful everything about pennyworth is delightful and doom patrol for all its fantastic story elements has some deep messages about finding ones purpose and power    i love the mandalorian hes a super hero in his ow way    i dont know if ive ever watched a batman movie i didnt at least like    and then theres jessica jones guardians of the galaxy and daredevil i love em all    so with a reasonable expectation of a most enjoyable evening ahead i watched black adam last night    ugh what a bunch of cgidependent drivel the good guy super hero team was meh af there was no chemistry between the characters no humor worth noting no credible personal transformation boring plot special effects so repetitive and overthetop it made me yawn  and fall asleep    fall asleep do you hear me yeah i was tired from sauntering around earlier in the day but 1 i dont fall asleep watching movies and 2 i dont think ive ever fallen asleep during a superhero movie    but this show a waste of 2 hours and 5 minutes of my life idve rather watched reruns of doom patrol any day    well serves me right i do usually check rotten tomatoes before watching a move and when i checked their site afterward i saw the movie got a splatted 38100 review thats about right imo
Dec 16 2023,negative,how is this garbage fan rated this highly did we all see the same movie
Dec 16 2023,negative,stole a great deal of opportunity and potential by burying it in hollywood aspirations and plans without properly using the comic material
Dec 15 2023,negative,i literally couldnt even get through it
Dec 13 2023,positive,i absolutely loved it a lot of action and a great story line
Dec 12 2023,negative,sucks so bad so much potential
Dec 8 2023,positive,an ancient civilization is in trouble and can only be saved by a young person who needs to seek out the powers of a demigod who is jaded and cynical and unwilling to help and that demigod is played by dwayne johnson     i didnt expect much but i definitely didnt expect moana  
Dec 6 2023,negative,rotten tomatoes got this one right usually i like movies with dewayne in it but this one sucked i just cant get into it i have tried to watch it a few times and i never get very far id say to skip this one
Dec 4 2023,negative,once again the rocks neverloseinafight contract gets in the way of any real character development  i mean how fragile does a mans ego have to be to demand such a stupid contract in every project he does
Dec 4 2023,negative,this movie had so much potential but was written so poorly why beat up the good guy put him in jail and then beg for his help at the end great actors good special effects could have been a great movie the writing sucked
Nov 28 2023,positive,it was a comic based super hero movie i liked it needed a sequel
Nov 22 2023,positive,this movie was amazing dont let the critics fool you we all know why they sent their troll farms to downvote this movie touches on subjects no one else is willing to speak on and i hope to see more of it in the future
Nov 17 2023,positive,black adam holds hits and misses aplenty but i think i got enough out of it by the time the credits rolled    the most standout part of this 2022 dceu flick is its humour albeit weirdly what i mean is that i found the comedy to actually be fairly amusing much more so than i was anticipating but the way it is placed into other events onscreen is very messy and almost forced    its as if they made the whole movie without humour and then went back and placed bits throughout like id be watching a gag and it would make me at least smirk though it would be surrounded by more serious moments so it comes across as unconnected its weird perhaps just a me thing    lorne balfes music is good i particularly enjoyed the justice society theme in the end titles  added it to my playlist already as for this films other elements i found the action to be well done  and as such the editing the special effects at the beginning for kahndaqs backstory isnt great though ive seen a lot of films early 2010s mind you use that sorta effect and it rarely comes out positively    castwise i have no negatives dwayne johnson fits the titular character as youd expect i wouldnt say his performance is anything all that great but what he gives is enough  when coming to terms with amons superhero ideas johnson plays off the learning on the job angle well    aldis hodge pierce brosnan and sarah shahi are solid mohammed amer offers good comedic relief definitely the one that got the most chuckles out of me the characters of noah centineo and quintessa swindell feel derivative though marwan kenzari is thankfully more villainy here than he is in 2019s aladdin    a more thorough execution and i may have loved this in the absence of that id simply class it as passable
Nov 15 2023,positive,a little darker than shazam overall a pretty decent movie the action was well executed the acting was ok dwayne does well as adam
Nov 14 2023,negative,holy crap pretty annoying story and characters flat attempt at some realworld allegory pierce brosnan shines as drstrange copy with shiny helmet but the rest of the cast is pretty underwhelming  including the rock and i typically like his charactersmovies but he doesnt properly fit the role character decisions are mostly dumb and their interactions feel forced for more action scenes its an okay btrash superhero movie if youre bored and either have a couple beers or the finger on the fast forward button but nothing that you will positively remember for long for its movie quality somewhere in there is an interesting arc for an antihero but oh boy does the script butcher that idea
Nov 11 2023,positive,i really enjoyed this movie great cast for the most part  some parts of the story did feel kinda weak and a little lets do a fight scene just for the sake of it  but overall enjoyed the movie and happily watch it again
Nov 10 2023,positive,a good watch especially for the fx and if you dont take your fun too seriously
Nov 10 2023,negative,this was bad and dc fans have zero taste 
Nov 8 2023,neutral,wasnt very good the rock wasnt good but the justice society of america characters were cool
Nov 5 2023,positive,this movie is better than it gets credit for not perfect but you dont even have to be a dc fan for it to be well worth a watch    i think this is the best movie visually from dc in the last decade maybe barring zss justice league the cgi was leagues better than what we saw with wonder woman dr fate and hawkmans appearances were especially stunning    some really cool characters were introduced as well unfortunately dr fate was nerfed into oblivion though this is understandable plot armor to not detract from the protagonist a plausible explanation wouldve still been nice though also nabus part of dr fate evidently doesnt exist in this universe still i would love to see more fate and adam going forward sadly it doesnt look like this movie will make it as canon going into dcs reboot though
Nov 3 2023,negative,its kind of dull with punctuated moments of an interesting origins story and some decent cgi if it was a half hour shorter it would have been better the endless cgi fight scenes made me lose interest
Oct 31 2023,negative,make a compilation of movies with a rock and you will not see the difference in his appearance
Oct 27 2023,positive,it was a solid movie some of the characters were cool
Oct 20 2023,negative,the action may be visually impressive but everything else about it is not nearly as impressive predictable plot boring characters all around and almost nothing to make you want to see or make anyone else see it
Oct 18 2023,positive,not my favourite super hero film but certainly entertaining and well made  and definitely a standout in the dc film franchise  dwayne johnson is pretty reliable to pick a good project these days  this role is perfect for him and i hope he gets to do another black adam though thats not looking likely after the box office performance of this film  its highly watchable though
Oct 15 2023,positive,now this was an amazing superhero film this is the film that wb needed to revive the dceu amazing score by lorne balfe amazing directing by jaume colletserra and even the vfx are amazing i absolutely loved how black adams story played out and the twists and turns that came with it pierce brosnan was perfection as dr fate and his chemistry with hawkman was fun to watch and the characters were given real weight above anything in the avengers the action is choreographed excellently the cinematography is spectacular the film as a whole is what we dc fans truly want the only reason i do not give it a full 5 stars is because it needed to be longer to truly flesh out some of the characters some of the vfx was a little off there were a few brief cheesy scenes very brief fantastic film overall bring back henry cavill
Oct 15 2023,positive,as usual the film critics got it wrong again this is a movie made for teens and scifi geeks like me and although flawed it was a huge improvement on most dc offerings i would recommend watching
Oct 12 2023,negative,a movie that could have been so very much more but once again we detect the stench of the corporate hitmen dumbing down the content to a level the average amoeba might be attracted by the changing light levels   a disjointed plot line showed only where the axe had been swung indicating that most of the film ended up on the cutting room floor rather than on the screen rated a wellearned two stars as a result so be grateful
Oct 10 2023,positive,every super hero movie does not have to follow the cookie cutter theme this is one that breaks the mold and the rock is just the person for the job this is a must see movie and if you dont love it the first time watch it again i loved it even more my second sitting there is a solid plot and solid reason for the movie and a solid main character who does not try to be the good guy so yep he kills people hes violent and for a good reason the supporting super heros are okay but they have their place so it works so called professional movie critics dont know everything getting paid to criticize and giving it a 38 shame on them easy 90 plus in my book and better than every other super hero movie for sure
Oct 4 2023,positive,this was desperate swing and miss from dc black adam has too much emotional for the rock while i liked seeing the justice society killing off dr fate was wrong as his story could of totally expanded while hawkguy and then wind girls cant
Oct 4 2023,positive,so confused by the lack of enthusiasm for this film i am a huge fan great story fantastic action sequences and dj himself performed the role to perfection still a lot darker than marvel so keeping with its own signature but small humorous pieces to lift it very well done dc
Oct 1 2023,negative,dc has had tough luck with its movies in the last few years and this one is another example of why dwayne johnson was a decent choice for black adam however the plot stripped the character of all motivations and had a poor excuse as the reason why the movie had potential with all the ad campaigns that were used but ultimately was a letdown
Oct 1 2023,negative,it was so boring and slow i struggled staying up to watch it
Sep 29 2023,positive,finally sat down and watched this movie and while its not the best superhero movie out there its definitely not the worst everyone played their roles well kind of a shame that the mid credit scene in this movie means absolutely nothing now though
Sep 28 2023,positive,it was actually a good movie better than shazam movie 1  2
Sep 26 2023,negative,bad film predictable and stolen
Sep 26 2023,positive,loved it hoping theres another lots of action little comedy and pleasing to the eye 
Sep 24 2023,negative,contrived and confused storyline endless fight scenes the justice society is a budget airline version of the justice league weak excuses for no established superheroes from the dc world feeble catch phrases no emotional engagement a well earned flop
Sep 23 2023,positive,visually satisfying piece of fantasy work not much dialogue and a little short on character development continuity problems since a man who has been dead for 5000 years should not know what a lunch box is for example escapist fun if you just relax and enjoy it without being too purist
Sep 21 2023,positive,this movie was awesome seriously i love the different take on a antihero that i knew nothing about but now am totally in love with to be honest dc hero based movies are always so cliche that wanna be depressing emo boy batman knock off was a disgrace too but for once i enjoyed a movie from dc my new favorite movie
Sep 20 2023,positive,i actually enjoyed black adam  not sure why it gets a bad rep or that there wont be a second movie   it was different and didnt follow the typical stereotype for a superhero movie   would definitely see it more than once and recommend it to others
Sep 18 2023,positive,its not as bad as a lot of reviews make it out to be  its a good origin story for a not as well known antihero cgi was hit and miss amd the main villian seemed like an plot grab to hype up black adam more than anything side heroes were ok but left something to be desired  it resembled deadpool im this fashion and not in a good way i did appreciate that aside from black panther they finally did an ethnic super hero movie with without needing to race swap characters and yet they still did with hawkman  good but could have been better
Sep 17 2023,positive,not a dc fan so not sure how it compares to the comics it was a good enough super hero movie following closer to the thor playbook
Sep 11 2023,negative,this was woke  which didnt surprise me and very demonic not good at all the rock was good at acting but everything else of this movies was demonic or woke
Sep 10 2023,positive,loads of action good story with a twist great balance between action and humor i honestly have no clue why critics think this movie is a disappointment
Sep 8 2023,positive,overall not too bad except for thd brosnan character
Sep 8 2023,positive,i thought black adam was fun and well done a lot of great action and the cgi was solid compared to a lot of the recent super hero movies dr fate was incredibly well done among my favorite in the dc universe lineup
Sep 8 2023,positive,i really enjoyed this movie  its not very deep but its a fun action romp and very enjoyable unless youre expecting something profound
Sep 3 2023,positive,i enjoyed this movie even though it wasnt perfect black adam dr fate and hawkman were well portrayed   had several truly fun moments but could have been better
Sep 1 2023,negative,childish logic who wrote this script what a waste of ip what a waste of time for the audience
Aug 31 2023,neutral,black adam moved at breakneck speed with loads of action  at least most of the time the movie would slow down occasionally for some exposition the writing is not great in this the film is digestible enough but it never really does one thing well whether its the undercooked characters forgettable action or a remarkably generic villain they do at least try to give black adam some character development but its never really reflected in johnsons performance just stating facts here and i blame the writers not him since we know the rock can act aside from peirce brosnan who is phenomenal their arent any good performances and overall the movie has a feeling that its very generic somewhat rushed but still entertaining for all that
Aug 31 2023,negative,so bad no words can describe part boring five parts cringe plus extra bonus of sheer stupidity its not like marvel films are the epitome of fine cinema but in comparison they are not as bad as that cmon dc you can do better than this
Aug 31 2023,positive,wow paving way for a future of new dc films cant wait to see what lies ahead great cast and special effects
Aug 30 2023,negative,the only way this can have a 90 audience score is from bots because anyone more sophisticated than a bot would find it tiresome    wastes a fantastic cast with a plodding mundane film with action scenes that look like an unreal demo from five years ago i hate tearing it apart as i know how much money and time was spent on this but clearly one of those things where the whole is much less than the sum of its parts    sarah shahi and the kid are a great start and then everything thats added just makes it worse and worse the rocks character just seems irritating and the movie has little humor or heart    incredibly disappointing considering what couldve been
Aug 29 2023,neutral,i watched the movie about 4 days ago on the plane now everything is kind of a blur the rock is in the movie as tethblack adam there are a bunch of side characters including 4 heroes amanda waller is on screen briefly and a bunch of disposable henchman soldiers a lot of cgifilled battles ensued sabbac showed up near the end good guy won the end the movie helped fill up 23 hours of my time on the plane but to be honest just about any other movie will do just as well give it a go if you like the superhero genre i guess
Aug 29 2023,negative,it simply ignored the lore and history of the characters bland and slow passed no real story to say
Aug 28 2023,negative,only gets a half of a star because thats the lowest rating i can give it
Aug 28 2023,negative,had such potentialbut  was an absolute waste of time put together with candy floss and wet underwear if anyone acting in this film or who made it is proud of themselves then theyre were fat kids at school that came last at sports whose parents told them you did amazing sweetie
Aug 27 2023,neutral,movie about a wannabe that attacks superhero posters
Aug 26 2023,negative,the storyline drolled on and on the rock in an awkawardly cut suit basically grunted for the 1st 13rd of the movie and had very little character development black adam was very overpowered and the side characters were all new to the average audiance member worth a stream but i wouldnt pay to rent it
Aug 22 2023,positive,i dont know why it got bad critics reviews but then again who listens to them anyway the effects were really good storyline was decent but expected and lets face it i would rather see a god rip someones arms off than just knocking em around the movie was kind of cheesy but definitely not as bad as the critics reviews its worth a watch
Aug 22 2023,positive,some of the writing was a little weak and a bit silly in places   sometimes entertaining but overall it would have been better as a 30 minute youtube video
Aug 21 2023,positive,beautiful storyline a couple of interesting twists about the 10th adams sonfamily nonstop action but somehow its not overwhelminggratuitous its just right theres a good scene after the credits thatll have you waiting for part ii  so stick around
Aug 21 2023,neutral,i just kept asking myself why why introduce a new dc superhero when the main bunch need more development and how does black adam fit into the universe and who were these other random new superheroes too once i got past those questions the movie was decent 52
Aug 19 2023,positive,solid superhero movie with good renditions of some of my favourite blist characters
Aug 19 2023,positive,its just fight when a fight was over another fight start até least já not boring
Aug 19 2023,positive,essentially a fantastic cinematic experience  very cool
Aug 15 2023,negative,they should have just made a doctor fate movie instead because pierce bronson stole this film the rest was just a mess and im a fan of dwayne johnson
Aug 15 2023,negative,the film initially received an r rating due to several gruesome death scenes and many cuts had to be made to the film to receive the lower pg13 rating     that is all you need to know about this movie a team of executives producers writers a director an entire team of absurdly over paid people pitched an idea for a movie based on a comic character    they then hired writers to take certain elements and plot lines from the characters long history and make a movie out of it    they then hired directors the highest paid yet most one dimensional actor in history to front it    they spent months having rewrites and changes spent months filming scenes over and over again when they were happy with it it was sent to post production where a team of very highly paid people plastered the movie in special effects    they had it in a studio for weeks to months with music being composed overlayed sound lines being rerecorded foleys producing sounds for movements and atmosphere then all of the audio was mixed and overlayed in a way they were happy with    and then what happened they took a finished product that they were content was a good vehicle to tell the story and completely buthcered it removed any scene that had the character acting like the character he is supposed to be removed any and all scenes that could possibly be deemed as too much for a child by the ridiculous american mpaa they watered down and hacked chunks out of their own product to sell more tickets even though it was already guaranteed to be a financial success since it has the rocks name attached to it they destroyed a story that they themselves had concocted and the end result is a completely different end product than what was pitched and even different from what was originally filmed its dumb it is completely and utterly moronic if you dont want to make an r rated movie and want to make yet another generic child focused brightly coloured pun filled movie that has about as much depth as an episode of peppa the pig then do that dont take a character who historically has had stories revolving around adult themes shoot an entire movie retaining the essence of the character and then proceeding to intentionally destroy any semblence of that character or the themes you were part of creating in the first place    i dont care for the rock personally zero acting ability and a selfish attention seeker in real life but this movie could and shouldve been good he cant act at all but he already has the ego and arrogance that could fit this character instead we get the most generic predictable and low effort childish movie that dc has ever churned out
Aug 14 2023,neutral,this movie is not really that good it has some interesting action here and there but its just hard to take seriously the rock is great but hes trying to be way too serious in this movie and its just kind of dumb in my opinion
Aug 13 2023,positive,sigh there are so many of these big budget mediocre super hero movies they are getting hard to tell apart  it is fine if you dont want to use your brain  the rock is fine  he is charismatic as always and they spent a bunch of money for stuff to go boom  but like a bunch of other movies it is just incomprehensibly dumb  i have no idea what the rocks motivation was  maybe he missed his dead son or something  there is this other wb superhero group called the justice society that whoa we have never heard of but rip off everything from other movies deadpool xmen etc including the two junior members that add absolutely nothing to the movie i could go on but you get the idea  one really weird thing in this movie  this is some made up middle eastern country occupied by unnamed mercenaries that the movie is cheering the over throw of  the movie is not explicitly antius but i wonder what the heck they were thinking when making this i mean the whole overthrow the oppressor thing is quite obvious
Aug 13 2023,positive,action action action action fast paced and straightforward action superhero movies should be more like this
Aug 12 2023,positive,the storyline was great lots of action and not your stereotypical hero plot highly reccomend watching it atleast once
Aug 12 2023,negative,the cgi was fine dr fate was cool but overall i just didnt care about anything that happened in the movie i didn see the point 
Aug 9 2023,positive,i feel like the neighbors kid off of the incredibles watching mrincredible in the parking lot with his car that was amazing havent seen a good movie like that in so long applauding as tired as i am with watching superheros everything about this black adam was entertaining had a great laugh in the end they always turn out to be a hero regardless but protector would be a different kind of perspective of seeing change game changer
Aug 9 2023,positive,movie was everything i wanted say what you want about the rock but his movies make bank the movie does focus more on the spectacle more than the story but first tell me what you know about black adam he isnt known in the comics as a deep character with a supporting cast so this movie does focus more on black adam which is fine for me if anything this is the best depictions of isis  osiris yet and they dont even have powers in the movie ill care about the jsa in a jsa movie for what they were here i was ok with also pierce brosnan steals every scene he is in     the action is chefs kiss you can tell they really put in the work to spotlight all of the characters powers and fight scenes were top tier so much vibrancy and eyegasmic shots elevated the movie for me and man lorne balfe went ham on this sound track this movie sets up a lot of things that i personally am looking forward to     when it comes to all this unnecessary divisiveness on social media about this movie and the dceu as a whole i honestly dont care have your opinion and ill have mine all the arguing is funny when you see it i simply loved this movie and cant wait to see it again and see everyone debuted in this movie again in future dc projects i left the theatre genuinely and unapologetically happy af     only 1 mid credits scene and even though i heard rumblings of it i still had enough doubt in my mind to truly enjoy it im very excited for future projects
Aug 6 2023,positive,i think the movie was kind of good because it was a dwayne johnson movie plus it had my favorite anti hero i was obssesed with it for 5 years now i think then after the movie it was a really good movie but then your brain tells you about the slavery scenes and sometimes you get worried so if you are some person that has that dont watch it but overall i recommend it because it is sort of funny has a good amount of violence enough for your kids to see and it has good courage also the right amount of powers so i do  recommend it for people that dont have that brain problem
Aug 5 2023,negative,oof unwatchable super hero movie starring a near unwatchable actor whose only real skill is muscle flexing cant imagine why this movie is so bad just plain bad does he walk around posing in front of mirrors all day  the dialog such as it was never developed into any plot then this black adam decided to be shazam with a bit of superman maybe lois lane too i dunno it was awful stop casting dwayne johnson expecting a meaningful movie of any kind he grunts he moans he poses he sweats he grimaces he does eye rolls he lifts heavy things  thats all
Aug 5 2023,positive,im not sure why the critics let this movie down but as a huge fan of dc and not so much of the rock mainly for politicle reasons  this movie was solid action packed enjoyable ok storyline but over all decent watch id watch it again  too bad they ruined it by canceling super man
Aug 5 2023,negative,i quit a half hour before it ended lifes too short to spend it watching black adam same old routine superhero tedium overstuffed with huge fights smashed skyscrapers energy beams coming out of hands or eyes exception some evil characters can also shoot energy beams from their mouths magical orbs and cartoonish eithergoodorbad characters which all seem to be impossible to kill so the stakes are zero   take a look at batman tas if you want to see excellent work bringing action comics to the screen
Aug 5 2023,positive,the movie was awesome rock was great
Aug 5 2023,positive,i really enjoyed this movie black adam tried to do a lot  introduce a new protagonist  i cant say hes a hero establish the jsa and expand the dceu much to my surprise they stuck the landing duane johnson was fine it was a typical rock performance  not great but he got the job done pierce brosnan and aldis hodge were fantastic as dr fate and hawkman noah centieno and quintessa swindell were quite good as atom smasher and cyclone the action scenes were extremely well done and the fx were superior this was not a colorybynumbers super hero movie it avoided the marvel formula as well as the snyderverse grimdark approach black adam was fresh and exciting and well worth watching fans of aquaman shazam ghost rider spirit of vengeance and shangchi will probably enjoy black adam
Aug 4 2023,negative,maybe dc has plans for a green lantern and black adam team up that would be really explosive considering both of those movies bombed
Aug 4 2023,positive,if you like the comic maybe skip this one it does not honor the antihero vibe strange choice to do a next gen when the original stories arent really out there and are really great atom smasher cgi is super cool but the way the character is written hes kind of weak sauce atom smasher is super disappointing because hes a boss in the comic with a lot of exciting action and storyline potential    it had the potential to be great but it needed more thoughtful story and character development if you like action and dont care about plots or people go watch
Aug 4 2023,negative,this movie has 3 sides   1 good cgi and battles overall  2 humor almost cartoonlike  3 an empty plot without any sense    2 annihilates 1 and 3 makes sure this movie will be forgotten really fast
Aug 2 2023,negative,such a group of lame heros what a boring movie
Aug 1 2023,positive,this has got to be one of my favourite dc movies just through the appearance of dr fate made this movie amazing however this gets 4 stars as dr fate dies in his first appearance on the big screen
Jul 31 2023,negative,poor another generic special effects film that is weak on story line not really worth the effort
Jul 31 2023,positive,black adam is an electrifying superhero film dwayne johnsons outstanding portrayal mindblowing visual effects and compelling storyline create a mustwatch experience    as a passionate fan of superhero movies i had high expectations for black adam and im thrilled to say that it exceeded them in every way dwayne johnsons portrayal of the titular antihero is nothing short of spectacular bringing raw intensity and depth to the character that truly showcases his acting prowess
Jul 30 2023,positive,the film is good the protagonist is excellent the characters are well developed the villain despite being generic is essential to the plot of the film my rating for this movie is 910
Jul 29 2023,negative,disjointed with a completely lacking storyline terrible casting terrible editing could only bare to watch for a short time one of the worst movies i have ever seen absolutely nothing in it to keep the audience invested or engaged
Jul 27 2023,positive,being a long time comic book fan the rock really did this justice fight scenes are awesome and i like the character development of black adam most people dont like this movie for movies sake but you got to remember these are comic book movies for comic book fans if youre a fan of those youll be a fan of this the only down side i have to this is it shouldve been more brutal and rated r
Jul 26 2023,positive,really enjoyable could have used more jsa members though
Jul 26 2023,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen a poorly written story with senseless fight scenes existing solely to add action and not hep the plot
Jul 25 2023,negative,total tripe my boy wanted to watch it so we did i dont like dc or marvel they are all pretty much tripe hes 12 and wanted to see it but he hated how i could predict everything that was happening its because hollywood is one heck of dire film maker and uses the same story in every film glad to see that dc and marvel havent got any better
Jul 25 2023,negative,this was bad like there was way too much
Jul 24 2023,positive,its not so bad just a bit to long after my taste
Jul 23 2023,positive,first off the rock did great and im not even a dc fan im a marvel fan and this was a pretty good movie some of that might have to do with how marvel movies have been terrible lately but i still thought this was a good movie
Jul 23 2023,positive,to be honest i can see why this flopped as even despite a being a big superhero movie fan it lost my attention at times especially at the start with the poor acting of the mother and son who feature constantly throughout i didnt think the action sequences were anything special which werent helped by the cgi not being very polished in parts despite those negatives it was a solid film still and one definitely worth a stream with pierce brosnan being the highlight for me
Jul 23 2023,positive,why not another one
Jul 22 2023,negative,the characters were flat  the rock had basically 1 expression on his face the whole time the only semilikeable characters were the uncle and son
Jul 21 2023,positive,best dc movie to date very cool overall not proamerica enough for the critics
Jul 21 2023,positive,i have to be honest i was drawn in by the hype and advertising and had nothing else to do but watch a film so glad i watched black adam   pure and simple escapism and entertainment from start to finish dj is great in the title role  with rest of the cast all playing their parts well one thing i really liked was the simplicity of the plot well explained and a sound quality which was directed so you could clearly hear conversation with no mumbling or excessive background noise this will be a very successful franchise of many sequels dc have a winner here that will rival and push marvel the critics really dont know what the public like ignore their silly academic nonsense this is a really good film
Jul 20 2023,positive,just a blast from start to finish a real easy watch that can be enjoyed many times
Jul 19 2023,positive,this movie is definitely a movie i know because my controller was not responding in the movie theater my least favorite part still a good part though was when they said its racism time and n worded all over everybody my favorite part was when they said im about to blow and some random white liquid covered mr black adam  in conclusion this a movie that has rock from fortnite and peely from real life i hope that you watch it so you get to see a movie that happened once also i fell asleep in the theater so this is actually a review of my dream thank you for reding
Jul 19 2023,positive,good movie with a decent story line have no idea why it got axed great effects and fight sequences
Jul 18 2023,positive,great super hero movie that is severely underrated by critics
Jul 17 2023,negative,its funny how this movie was supposed to reboot dc yet they gave us a comic book movie that uses exactly the same formula as every other comic book movie if youre going to reboot you need to go back to the drawing board and come up with something fresh and new you can have all the crashing and smashing in the world it doesnt stop your movie being boring and forgettable
Jul 16 2023,negative,the rock is absolutely delightful  the rest of the movie is terrible  it seems like there was a much better version of the film that was edited down to the lowest common denominator  goodness please hold a shot for more than 2 seconds at least during some of the dialogue scenes  cut cut cut cut cutbut not an interesting way more of a catwoman wayugh   watched black adam shazam 2 and zack snyders justice league back to back to back  it went from bad to good to great
Jul 16 2023,neutral,i mean sure theres a decent amount of material in there thats fun and exciting but mostly its by now all too familiar rehashed superhero tropes ultimately lost it when it got to civilians fighting a zombie army that was just too much some of the acting is really wooden many things just make too little sense
Jul 15 2023,negative,i think am starting to hate the rock
Jul 14 2023,positive,here are my thoughts on this movie that i saw a year ago in theaters with my dad  1 dwayne johnson aka the rock is a great pick for black adam    2 there was so much fun action    3 i am disappointed that we arent going to see a superman vs black adam fight    4 i hope we can get a sequel someday    overall great movie best dceu movie 1010
Jul 13 2023,negative,if i could give 0 stars i would felt like a high budget disney channel movie with a big name actor being the only main gimmick 2 hours of my life i wish i could have back
Jul 13 2023,positive,black adam fails to have a worthy plot and steady pacing but still gives multiple standout performances namely brosnan johnson and hodge
Jul 13 2023,negative,honestly if it wasnt for the rock i really doubt id have finished this tedious formulaic nonsense why they changed his origin is beyond me why they chose to introduce to a new team to take him on without giving the audience any time to get to know or care about a single one of them when the shazam team already exist in this universe and were clearly the obvious and sensible choice is beyond me why anybody thinks this utter twoddle is anything but garbage is  beyond me i gave the half star for the rock nothing else was any good
Jul 12 2023,negative,not the worst super hero movie ive watched
Jul 12 2023,positive,i loved the movie what a refreshing view on a superhero more please
Jul 10 2023,neutral,black adam is your run of the mill superhero flick for some that may satisfy but for others looking for a unique adventure its sure to disappoint
Jul 9 2023,negative,that was a dour cgi filled mess that too all the charisma of the rock and left it off the screen
Jul 9 2023,neutral,johnson and co took as long as they did to release at best a very very average superhero movie  the first act wasnt too bad but the second and third acts are terribly written and very cringe in places  the film played it far too safe its no wonder dc is overhauling the way they are  the thing is i dont think they need an overhaul they just need a serious course cohesive correction with elements they have in place
Jul 9 2023,positive,it was definitely one of the better superhero flims i have watched the rock really plays his role of an anti hero well and helped to create an interesting story arc around khandaq that makes it a mustwatch
Jul 8 2023,positive,it was actually pretty good  yes you had some cheese to the story line but most graphic novels do as an opening film to a new character thumbs upshame we wont see anymore or where or what it could become especially with henry cavill
Jul 8 2023,neutral,action sequences were great coupled with the special effects made for an exciting watch however weak character arks with little to no connection with any of the characters left me wanting for a more meaningful movie experience
Jul 8 2023,positive,its great to see an antihero someone who is kind of halfway between being good and being bad like catwoman of batman fame she was one of the favourite characters because she wasnt onedimensional and dwayne the rock johnsons version of black adam he was the producer as well so it is very much his character is that hes a bit like the dc version of deadpool and we all love him the plot was decent though one complaint is that black adam was just too strong and it was all a bit too easy for him the whole way through but thats kind of realistic sometimes isnt it one thing i hate not just with comics but storytelling generally is when we give people challenges for the sake of having challenges whats wrong with someone just not having challenges i like it the fact that he is battling internal conflicts is good i am not familiar with the comic book character but really i found it to be fun i think it might be good to set up future movies and i liked that the rock just did not care sure so the rock always plays the rock in all of his movies but so what no this isnt a very complicated movie but its a bit of fun i really liked it for what it was  a bit of power and a bit of fun it wasnt quite as dark as brightburn and not as horrifying as the boys but it had the same kind of feel  what if superman were evil well here he is not quite evil so much as just refusing to comply to your beliefs of good and evil yup there you have it its much better than these twodimensional blackandwhite goodandevil characters that you so often get with superhero movies but in saying that it wasnt very deep i loved that it didnt care about your feelings and told the story it wanted to tell but it could have been better for one thing they didnt explain why he suddenly knew english or was that his magic its not bad though and it suggests that a sequel or more would be even better i gave it 710
Jul 7 2023,positive,does what you want attempts at humour are ill advised for a fun film 4 stars for story and dialogue 1 star still enjoyabke though
Jul 7 2023,positive,i think i must be growing out of these superhero movies it seems to me that of the ones i have seen it is the same story rehashed with different characters  this was ok but it was so predictable it was spectacular but its all been done so many times before the last superhero movie i really enjoyed was spiderman no way home
Jul 7 2023,positive,the best dc movie ive watched in a while i would watch this again its nice having a new super hero one not done a million times in movies i never expected the twists in this one and i like the anti hero vs heros collide
Jul 7 2023,negative,its the most cliche and generic super hero movie ive ever seen its like an ai tried to make a marvel movie without understanding why marvel movies are so good in the first place recycling cliches and plot points feels stale
Jul 6 2023,negative,not serious cgi sucks and acting was insanely amateur
Jul 3 2023,positive,honestly was considering 3 or 35 but went for 35 because i would say its good and i recommend it    there isnt that much to critique here because the movie is very simplistic the plot is simple cliché but sometimes you want to see something like that and honestly the execution is good the rock hawk fate are really entertaining to watch for me the fates arc was the best out the ones in the movie the cgi isnt the most realistic but i like the way they did effects movie can choose a more stylized asthetic the pacing is very much hollywood style the movie just grips you with things happening constantly and a lot of action it doesnt slow down to do more character building    an entertaining movie i liked it
Jul 3 2023,positive,while i didnt go to see this movie in theaters due to all the let down from most of the dcu movies i did watch it and boy was it a fantastic watch dwayne johnson is absolutely perfect for the character i loved to see hawkman and fate in the movie as well all in all i think this has been the best dcu movie and i would hate to see it not get a part 2 if black adam does get a part 2 i will definitely go to see it in theaters
Jul 2 2023,positive,surprise surprise what a shocker the critics rating and the publics or audience if you will rating are polar opposites of each other so whats new nothing this happens all the time     why do we even have movie critic reviews who cares what they think theyre almost always at odds ends with the audience score and were the ones actually paying to see the movie you make your money off of us so that being said dont you think you should care more about what the general public says and thinks about a movie than some hoity toity stuck up smug arrogant worthless opinion having movie critic kinda makes sense to me looks like we the people the money spenders the movie goers liked black adam 88 on the still fairly recent back end of the covid 19 pandemic is a pretty good grade to me
Jul 1 2023,neutral,this movie was so incredible it was super good to see someone new playing a dc star i also dont understand why people do not like this film i understand that origin movies might not be favors for most people but i truly enjoyed this movie
Jul 1 2023,positive,its not an amazing movie but its a fun movie and these ratings prove that the pro movie reviewers dont know how to judge a movie thats made to be a fun movie without putting a bunch of stupid extra criteria they shouldnt be i waited to watch this movie from all the bad press it got but i took the time to watch it on a plane flight and i am now wondering why it got such bad reviews johnson and the whole cast was good were not talking avengers end game here but easily surpasses most of the dc movies and now producers are saying never again why it was better than quantumania by a long shot i think theres hollywood politics and perhaps some other stuff bringing rating down here its not a super complex story and is somewhat predictable but its executed well frankly its a shame because it was high time we saw the rock as a superhero
Jun 30 2023,positive,absolutely amazing dont listen to the critics 8410
Jun 29 2023,negative,2 hours of my life i will never get back great acting by the egyptian kid tho
Jun 29 2023,positive,its was solid dr fate was perfect
Jun 29 2023,negative,awful movie with bad dialogue and cgi  never wanna rewatch
Jun 28 2023,positive,could have been better but it was fun none the less
Jun 25 2023,positive,this movie isnt for everyone and some people will be disappointed in it but i genuinely liked the movie its a solid superhero film there are some flaws but overall i dont think its as bad as people say but thats up to you
Jun 24 2023,negative,just a bad movie said that henry cavill wasnt in the more it wouldve made it better but with just a small segment of henry cavill not even superman could save how bad this movie is
Jun 24 2023,positive,what dwayne johnson did with black adam  a part time villian to a full time superhero hero was great amazing action  great cgi  decent story its a good ride and youll enjoy the action alot thank u rock
Jun 22 2023,positive,i agree with sabbacs latestage introduction its more of the story line i liked telling how and why he came about
Jun 22 2023,negative,terrible movie which could of been so much batter dwayne johnsons very cardboard performance let the character down    i was very much looking forward to this movie and unfortunately was extremely disappointed
Jun 22 2023,positive,i think the movie is awesome  might have been better with a lead in from justice society but this is great
Jun 21 2023,positive,lore accurate the rock couldve atleast had an accent
Jun 20 2023,negative,like the rock in general but this movie is the cutting edge of mediocrity 
Jun 20 2023,negative,5 stars for the supporting cast  crew minus 45 stars for the cliche ridden post production assembled story centered around johnson  his blind ego trip of a film
Jun 20 2023,positive,i dont get why this movie has such bad reviews the movie was epic rock was awesome storyline was good hawkman was 1010 dr destino same give the movie a chance and im sure you will love it sure it wont happen with these reviews but want to see the 2nd one
Jun 19 2023,negative,an entire movie of the rock trying to make the dceu all about him
Jun 17 2023,positive,loved every minute of it i must admit i often like the very first film of a series bc you get the whole back story you see how someone develops from being pure evil or a kid or a normal person into a superhero and dwayne johnson is a good actor he can be tough he can be funny but hes never cringey
Jun 16 2023,negative,its the biggest piece of dog shit
Jun 16 2023,positive,black adam    black adam is a movie about the dc antihero that emerged from the pages of the shazam comic books it stars dwayne the rock johnson in the titular role i dont quite understand why the critics mostly gave it a low rating because for me it was quite entertaining although the story is formulaic it packs a lot of action and fan service  johnsons charisma is still undeniable and he is able to capture the audiences attention with his acting and stunts some are saying that this should revive the dc cinematic universe and i agree  if you watch the end credit scene you will know whats coming up next although this movie is heavy on cgi the battle sequences are very impressive it is mostly black adam versus the justice society of america who are trying to stop his plans entertainment value is high and it has a little bit of heart too
Jun 15 2023,neutral,the justice society is amazing but everything else is just mediocre the movie adds unnecessary scenes with popular music just for the sake of adding it and the movie lacks heart although having good action scenes the rocks performance and the movie are mediocre
Jun 15 2023,negative,script is bad plot doesnt make any senseanother dc bad film
Jun 14 2023,neutral,its a great  action movie but with a confusing and bad storyline
Jun 13 2023,positive,its good surprisingly the acting is solid overall with the rock being the best thing he doesnt say much but he is charming and has some low key witty humor some of the supporting cast is just ok and can kind of disappear the kid isnt bad but was a bit annoying at first but once there was less of him in the second half he got better the villain is ok and a bit generic and forgettable despite a loaded backstory because he isnt focused on that much brosnan hodge and karimadrianna are good the humor is solid also what holds it back is a lot of these characters are one dimensional but there well acted despite that especially the justice society who doesnt have much depth but there creative and well acted still the music is good and has a good mixture of 60s70s songs and cinematic score that works well though it isnt as catchy as guardians of the galaxy the cinematography is good its creative the sets are memorable and the fights are cool to watch the only issues is sometimes it doesnt make use of its settings and can be basic to look at and some oversaturation of cgi but it is creative for the most part and well done the editing and pacing are good also this stays focused on black adam the whole way however toward the end it starts to feel a bit rushed especially when adam gives up his powers i wish there was a bit more buildup toward the end rather than flooring it with straight action that being said its fun charming interesting commentary about a darker hero and cool though it isnt anything you havent seen before anyone who is a big fan of any actors in this dc films or a big superhero fan than give this a watch its a fun time
Jun 13 2023,positive,black adam is greatdwayne johnson and pierce brosnan are great and the vfx too  the villain isnt as memorable as others but its still great  rip henry cavill always love youi clappex in that scene
Jun 13 2023,negative,this is totally the movie i made when i was 9
Jun 13 2023,positive,the movie is about onpar with most other nonnolan dc movies which is to say mediocre black adam is a badass and they capture the essence and aesthetic generally speaking however i really wish the rock attempted the kandaq accent to make it more realistic i felt like black adam was just a slightly more serious and unemotive version of the rock it really just reinforces his limited range as an actor and im a huge rock fan for nearly 25 years so it pains me to say it    pierce brosnan as dr fate is awesome the action scenes are great the story is meh as a comic book fan i feel like potential was squandered but this is really in line with expectations
Jun 10 2023,negative,3rd string dc characters with the rock playing himself horrible cgi and boring
Jun 8 2023,positive,it was an okay movie nice to see the rock coming to dc
Jun 7 2023,positive,i watched the movie multiple times so far im still trying to figure out why it didnt fair well i saw it in the theaters and twice from home im still trying to figure out what was so bad about the movie that it scored a 38  but the audience has it closer to 90 smh seems a little biased with the scoring
Jun 6 2023,positive,black adam is an okay film it is about black adam who is freed from his earthly tomb ready to unleash his unique form of justice on the modern world dwayne johnson and pierce brosnan give decent performances the script is a little slow in places jaume colletserra did an alright job directing this movie i liked this motion picture because of the action and adventure
Jun 5 2023,positive,it was a good movie but cyclones special effects were lacking cyclone and atom smasher seemed like they were thrown into the movie haphazardly it was a fun action movie overall though
Jun 5 2023,positive,this movie is amazing you have so much action and the effects and cgi is just perfection but why is this a 4 12 not 4 the reason is because they really nerfed some of the characters like how did doctor fate become so weak and how did black adam kill basically the most powerful wizards also i feel there should have been some jokes in there to lighten up the mood but overall what a amazing movie i recommend it to everyone except the people who love to nikpick
Jun 4 2023,positive,the special effects and the offbeat humor of blackadam are awesome
Jun 4 2023,positive,fun movie epic action it was cool to see hawkman  dr fate in live action too
Jun 3 2023,negative,it is just weird that the rock is playing this character i didnt like go next
May 28 2023,negative,this is just a bad movie i like the rock but this is not good
May 27 2023,positive,i loved this film for once they got everything right the action was fantastic n the shots in slow motion amazing the dialogue was perfect i loved that dwayne johnsons character was not a hero didnt want to b a hero he just wanted to take out the bad guys n did beautiful also this film was funny w out getting silly n carried away all the characters were great n the actors portrayed them beautifully the little boy was a bit annoying but other than that great film pleasantly surprised
May 27 2023,negative,visually great but it lacked in story and originality the stuff involving the justice society was fantastic and pierce brosnan was perfectly cast as doctor fate but even they werent able to balance out the sour taste left by the rest of the movie
May 27 2023,positive,badass movie one of the best in the dc universe i get it some ppl didnt like it movie critics drink too much cool aid and need to put controversial statements to continue to be popular
May 26 2023,positive,i enjoyed it idk what these so called critics are saying just as good as any marvel movie alot of new faces good story hopefully a part 2 does happen
May 26 2023,positive,pretty good had a great time and there were interesting characters not very much character building but still quite the story and pretty funny too 
May 24 2023,positive,this movie by itself is better than any other mcu production belonging to the fifth phase you cant change this opinion i have about it
May 22 2023,neutral,i am a fan of origin movies but this one was a letdown with a very thin story depth the cgi seemed worse than in video games and the editing was terrible the dialogues were way too cheesy for my taste i had gone in expecting even worse with all that negative reviews around so in the end it was better than i expected but still a forgettable watch
May 22 2023,positive,the power of the rock
May 22 2023,neutral,nah a wasted potential for justice society a bad pg13 rating a good runtime for this trash film and awful characters
May 20 2023,positive,as fan of the comics i was happy 
May 19 2023,positive,this movie was actually a great movie im glad i didnt listen to negative reviews dwayne has always been a favorite actor of mine and he directed the film very well it could have done with a little more back story but i enjoyed it very much and got some great laughs  dwayne the comedian lol he hangs out with kevin hart too much love it 
May 19 2023,positive,im not getting why black adam was deemed non viable i thought it was well done and totally hit all the spots wish theyd do a 2nd part itd be well worth watching with superman at the end and id like them to go a little bit more into the characters
May 19 2023,positive,i loved the cgi and the script  i never heart about this black adam  indeed this film is lovely      i would like to watch black adam ii for sure 
May 14 2023,positive,these critics have their snooty noses up their butts   its an awesome movie   i didnt watch it to dissect the dialogue and cinematography into oblivion and try to show people that i have refined tastes up there on my high horse   i watched it for entertainment and to feel excited and have fun it delivered all that  everyone did an amazing job in it and it kept my attention it made me laugh a lot and if you have a dark sense of humour like me youll find its really up your alley   awesome fun great cast i love all the explosions and bad guys actually dying instead of letting the justice system deal with them ugh   shame the audience score isnt more of a prominent feature when you google this movie critics dont think or speak for the vast majority and it shows
May 13 2023,positive,it was fine like most dc films the concept was good but it felt like it just needed a better script the atom smasher  cyclone characters felt unneeded and just got lost in the shuffle black adam being an antihero made it difficult to care about him  get really invested in his fate dr fate  hawkman were fairly enjoyable characters the midcredits scene was a good way to wrap up the film even though i highly doubt well ever get a payoff from it it wasnt a bad movie but it couldve used some better writing to really make the story work
May 12 2023,negative,a movie full of cliches with poor actings except for doctor fate which is very good and poor motivational speeches are some of the things that makes this movie one of the worst superhero movies of all time ahead of dragon ball evolution only knowing the stories behind the scenes im glad the movie bombed otherwise dwaynes ego would inflate and dc would be destroyed by this type of horrible movies
May 12 2023,negative,yawn the rock is the worst
May 8 2023,negative,gunn please save the dc universe
May 8 2023,negative,another movie where bravadao takes priority above quality protect your time and organize your closet and yikes why is brody so obsessed with cocacola godard and insists on an overcomplication of language in order to make an obvious point this is a bad film
May 8 2023,negative,it was crap the rock got to big for his shoes on this in my opinion   hes a good actor and funny i like most of his stuff but this was pushed so hard to be the next big thing and just flopped imo
May 7 2023,positive,wait a good dc movie thats impossible shitpost
May 7 2023,negative,yawn fest not dwaynes best work
May 7 2023,positive,i enjoyed the plot and the story there were some parts where the acting was a little meh other parts were too predictable post credit scene was rather disappointing but other than that i rather enjoyed it
May 5 2023,positive,loved the non stop action thought it was brilliant the teenage characters who just made me cringe are the only thing stopping it from being a 5 star especially the teenage lad in it he really ruined parts of the movie for me
May 3 2023,negative,lazy writing more than half of the film is just characters that arent introduced nicely fighting each other
May 3 2023,positive,the cast is good the story and the development is boring the villain is forgettable and has almost no lines the photography is simple it has a filter that says we are not in the usa there are ridiculous scenes in the final battle
May 3 2023,negative,i have no problem with the rock its just that the cgi was trash but the movie in general was better then most dc movies i really loved the action and stuff but it just wasnt a good movie
May 2 2023,positive,much better than i thought i think the critics were too harsh  it would have been nice to see continued
May 2 2023,positive,very underrated i loved this movie
May 2 2023,positive,loved the movie honestly the only thing that bothered me was the kid and his obsession with his skateboard im not a big comic book person i dont know how the original was meant to be but the skateboard really annoyed me for whatever reason still loved the movie though
May 2 2023,positive,i saw this movie three times at the cinema black adam gets better every time that i watch it it is such a fun movie the rock is the goat greatest of all time the movie gives a great first introduction to the justice society i want to see more of the justice society in the dcu going forward
May 1 2023,positive,this is not the best movie ive ever seen but one of the best movies of 2022 sure this movie is really fun and made me excited to see more of this character in the worst cinematic universe ever dwayne the rock johnson as black adam and pierce brosnan as dr fate stole it and its fun to see our dutch proud marwan kenzari as the villain great movie i wished i could have seen in theaters
Apr 30 2023,positive,it is bad but very funny i have nothing more to add
Apr 30 2023,negative,what a mess an overproduced cgiheavy junk pile
Apr 29 2023,positive,wasnt as bad as i thought the saving grace was dr fate and the justice society but the rock as we all already know cant act trying to use henry cavil to make his movie a success still wasnt enough to over look his bad acting
Apr 27 2023,positive,this movie had a lot of action and as a comic book fan it was cool to see some of the characters had an awesome soundtrack and awesome twists in the movie the vfx or cgi was odd at times but other than that it was awesome
Apr 26 2023,negative,not sure if it was because dwayne johnson was the main character but the storyline shouldve been a lot better would not watch again
Apr 25 2023,negative,great visually   but  so  annoying  him crashing  through walls  all the time and more
Apr 23 2023,positive,after the poor reviews i was surprised how good this movie is i dont know what dc fans or critics want but its a superheroaction movie that delivers action  superheros
Apr 23 2023,positive,an interesting watch and an ever moreso interesting soundtrack that feels like it was truly made different you can see where the storyline is going so sad it was killed off by dc just when the fun was about to start
Apr 21 2023,positive,loved it enjoyed the action seasons the music johnson played the character well the justice society scenes were a bit jarring for me nothing to do with the actors as such more that their place is the narrative seemed a bit odd we barely know who the character is and there are already american heroes who know his whole back story and want to save the day although it was worth it to see adrianna tell the western imperialist colonisers to go home  solid movie shame it doesnt seem to be continuing under gunns leadership
Apr 19 2023,negative,the first or second death is one of the good people falling from the sky before anyone has any powers probably was even worse as a screenplay the dialogue was brainless  jafars acting still sucked would have enjoyed this movie much more if a different villain were cast
Apr 18 2023,negative,killer special effects thats about it
Apr 16 2023,positive,movie was visually good but lacked a good plot disappointing that dc is deciding to move on from all previous movies
Apr 16 2023,positive,i liked the movie even though i was not familiar with the justice league the story was well done all actors were great and it was highly entertaining i will never follow the critics comments i dont know why they are in business it feels like they are getting paid to write badly about movies otherwise it doesnt make sense i only trust the audience it is a superhero movie that is entertaining and it ends well plus the teaser was awesome
Apr 16 2023,positive,cgi was great the story seemed dated and the rock was being himself although it did make for a few awesome action sequences pierce brosnan is the best part of the movie wish he wouldve had his own film with the justice society he was definitely the best part of the movie
Apr 16 2023,negative,i would rather have food poisoning than watch this again
Apr 14 2023,positive,dr fate and the justice society in general were awesome it was great to see dwayne johnson in this kind of character was not the movie of the year but pretty nice  if only justice league could have been like this
Apr 14 2023,negative,how this can be real movie
Apr 13 2023,negative,dc just needs to stop ugh
Apr 13 2023,positive,i think this movie will be the darkest and most violent of all the dc big screen movies released so far excited
Apr 12 2023,positive,it gave off as a zack snider vibe it also gave the fans excitement and a modern day super hero a role to be a hero from the comics dc has let us down in many ways but this movie shed light that dc is just as cool as marvel
Apr 11 2023,positive,dwayne johnson as a super person cant really go wrong 
Apr 10 2023,negative,i wonder how many of the audience votes are fake this was the most action packed fighting movie ive ever seen to the point of ridiculousness none of the characters are either memorable or likable except atom smasher
Apr 9 2023,positive,this could be among the better offerings that dc has released i really enjoyed the design and pacing i will definitely go see the next one if they make it with dc you never know
Apr 9 2023,positive,my family and i enjoyed it very much it had its moments of seriousness and funny
Apr 9 2023,positive,the movie was fun and action packed the dcu needs more like this and suicide squad
Apr 9 2023,negative,i like the rock and his movies but this one was not my favorite the story really dragged on and was tough to follow i had a tough time watching to the end it did not keep the attention of my kids either
Apr 9 2023,positive,this is a great action packed movie that feels good dont dissect it just enjoy the fast paced action
Apr 8 2023,positive,the critics destroyed this epic movie the execs listened to the critics instead of its fans thats why dcu is gonna fail big time we had to fight to get the real jl what a sad pathetic excuse for a studio
Apr 7 2023,negative,i am a big dc fan which is why it pains me that this was so boring all actionand not very good action acting was poor with the exception of pierce brosnan at this point the rock is just the rock all his characters are the same wont be watching again
Apr 7 2023,positive,not a huge dc fan but this movie had its moments decent action but cant really remember why it was all happening so that should tell you all you need to know
Apr 7 2023,positive,its the rock as a superhero youll have fun could have been a bit better but its a rock movie above all so yeah 
Apr 7 2023,negative,probably the most boring and bland dc movie
Apr 6 2023,negative,this movie is just sad i am a big geek and it makes me so sad that there are movies like this that make such a bad reputation for the superhero subgenre not one thing in this movie is not a mess it amazes me that at no point during producing it no one thought at least that its not good not to say its a complete mess or maybe they just wanted to grab cash on big names with the least possible effort but still even if thats the case its amazing that they did not want to at least try to make a decent movie
Apr 6 2023,positive,awesome movie great action and awesome cast
Apr 6 2023,positive,another fun movie from dc comics black adam in this movie is powerful  merciless pierce brosnan dr fate steals the movie for me his character is so fascinating selfless  yet powerful as well too bad this movie didnt get to release in china otherwise a sequel or something may have been made in the future a drawback of this movie an origin story is they are all the same over  over you can literally predict stages of events before they happen because youve seen this movie before whether its antman  aquaman  ironman as fun as the movie was to watch the cgi at times seemed blurry and not sharp i believe this movie couldve been made with a way lower budget of 90120 million and performed better at the box office to turn profit dwayne johnson at most time is portrayingdwayne johnson i didnt feel like i was watching black adam as in lore and comics hes quite different in voice  looks this black adam doesnt have pointed ears nor talks with an accent  its just the rock being the rock overall its a tough movie  it was great to see a comic movie where the villian or hero kills without question we need more r rated super hero movies this is rated pg13 of course
Apr 6 2023,positive,this movie couldve been great but instead it ended up as nothing more than the rock in a superhero costume punching people in slowmotion for 2 hours
Apr 5 2023,positive,it is just a lot of hype but other than the weak storyline this movie is good the rock is way to serious though
Apr 5 2023,negative,black adam the highly anticipated dceu film starring dwayne the rock johnson has unfortunately fallen short of expectations despite johnsons undeniable charisma the movie fails to deliver an engaging storyline and instead relies heavily on cgi to provide the spectacle the excessive use of special effects comes at the expense of character development and emotional depth leaving the audience feeling disconnected from the action on screen    the films lack of substance is not helped by the feeling of being a mere trailer for future dc movies leaving viewers with the impression that the movie exists only to set up future storylines rather than tell its own even the most dedicated action film fans may find themselves underwhelmed by black adam    one cant help but wonder what went wrong with johnsons passion project the movie seems to have become a victim of its own hype promising a gripping story but ultimately delivering a forgettable experience its a disappointing addition to the dceu lacking the charm and entertainment value of some of the franchises most successful films
Apr 4 2023,negative,had high hopes and it started off pretty good but just went down hill to the terrible end
Apr 4 2023,positive,the ending mimics the one animation where superman versus off against black adam
Apr 4 2023,positive,it was great to see this story hit the silver screen there is no perfect hero film and this film is no exception it gets many things right and wrong but the wrongs are few and passing while the good are more plentiful even if never shooting to the moon im sorry that ending of the film may have contributed to the end of henry cavill as superman moving forward but supermans cameo was one of the more awesome things that weve ever seen in a hero movie everything thing else was semantics from dr faith constantly removing his mask noncomicbookaccurate bald black adam and black adam being more antihero verses more villian in the end it was a fun ride and a spectacle of awesome fx
Apr 3 2023,negative,not even close to marvel standards  poor writing and bad actors only great thing is the visual effects
Apr 3 2023,negative,poor acting really really poor story line attempt to humour failed visual effect ok
Apr 3 2023,negative,this is a movie that exists i suppose
Apr 3 2023,positive,very dumb but very cool
Apr 3 2023,positive,great fun same formula as other superhero movies
Apr 3 2023,negative,black adam is burdened with a cluster of problems the villain is forgettable and motivation weak the world building is basically nonexistent and there is a serious lack of creativity behind the plot there essentially is none but the characters are entertaining and acted well the effects for the most part are good and the action is exhilarating and entertaining
Apr 2 2023,negative,other than special effects this movie is slow feels as if the actors justncalled it in  an hour into the movie and husband and i still didnt care about any of it disappointed
Apr 2 2023,positive,its ok its the rock so you got that not the best story tbh could have been a lot better
Apr 1 2023,positive,look this movie has been ridiculed to pieces so ill say what i enjoyed it was exactly what i expected but the justice society sans wonder woman for some reason were fantastic to see in live action they were the stars johnsons take was different than any version id seen he was menacing with a touch of comedic innocence def kills alot of innocent people indirectly again exactly what i expected out of it it desperately needed a shazam shazam desperately needed black adam a superman black adam shazam movie could have saved the dceu
Apr 1 2023,positive,i enjoyed this movie   definitely way better than the last couple of dc projects
Mar 31 2023,positive,i loved it the action was nice the cg was nice introduction of adams looked promising
Mar 31 2023,positive,one of the best dc movies need this to continue with the main story line
Mar 30 2023,positive,this is an incredible movie i dont get all the hate are people just this brainwashed by marvel and disney to just instinctively hate all dc movies this movie is so good beats any thor movie by a mile yes take that marvel fanatics
Mar 30 2023,negative,ive never felt the need to write a review for a movie but wow this movie was so awfully boring from the well thought out plot to the compelling monotonous dialogue i thought dc was finally starting to move in the right direction i guess thats what happens when you cast the rock to play an interesting and dynamic character
Mar 30 2023,negative,disappointing at best  the only part i liked was the justice society scenes but they were killed off  another movie with a heroic kid old beyond his years on a skateboard just nonsense  thank goodness i got the bluray from the library but thats 120 minutes of my life i wont get back  skip it
Mar 29 2023,positive,i dont know why the critics gave it so low it was alright
Mar 29 2023,positive,its good to see a superpowered the rock fighting against enemies but the plot of the movie is shallow and it has no heart
Mar 29 2023,positive,trying hard to be as cool funny gore as anti hero like deadpool but somehow entertaining
Mar 29 2023,neutral,not that bad of a movie but it is just painfully generic
Mar 28 2023,positive,pretty good movie with good actions scenes and vfx     the script isnt very searched taught  the jsa introduction is a bit out of nowhere  the backstory dont fit with what was established with shazam   and the rock ruined a little bit black adam wanting to play a hero more than a vilain    still enjoyable
Mar 28 2023,positive,didnt expect much from the movie but after seeing it i have to see it was great to watch
Mar 28 2023,positive,an enjoyable movie  had a few poor plot mechanics  but overall a good action flick
Mar 27 2023,positive,dc fails again  how can you have a serious action hero activate his powers with shazam   the movie loses all credibility at that point  even worse it comes out just a couple of months before shazam and a shazam trailer precedes it   the humor of shazam embarrasses black adam which wants you to take the antihero seriously  come on man  the plot is lame and the action sequences dont meet the standard of an action hero movie   the attempts at humor are recycled from numerous previous films  this could have been written by ai software  dc needs to run their movie ideas and plots past some consumers too start to gain credibility  they still trail disney  this barely matches the worst of the marvel films  and unlike most dc movies even the villain isnt interesting
Mar 27 2023,positive,superb movie i highly recommend it no dull movement comedy fightings and emotional the movie is great
Mar 26 2023,positive,exciting way better than the snooze fest movies we see these critics rate higher
Mar 26 2023,neutral,sad that people give this high praise nothing against the actors but the script was okay dcs continued use of heavy and dark cgi is getting boring with the added cliche after cliche after cliche story telling one i did not get invested in the characters and two to have major events happen to characters with anticlamatic build up dc could have assisted in this and built a much stronger narrative for this movie maybe next time start with a movie to just introduce a team of heroes and build them up then feed them to black adam i guess we will just continue to watch dc fail now that james gunn is in charge of making these cliches
Mar 26 2023,positive,super generic great cast except the annoying kid hodge  brosnan were the standouts as hawkman  dr fate alas all of hawkmans lines sound like chat gpt script good action sequences that had no emotional weight whatsoever but also pretty good vfx     great post credits scene that unfortunately will lead to nothing i enjoy the rock in action comedies but he didnt get much chance to flex his comedic muscles here    6910 c
Mar 26 2023,positive,a great fun movie with lots of action 
Mar 25 2023,negative,i hade such high hopes for this movie but it fell flat i nearly left the theater multiple times but stayed hoping it would improve it did not i hope this lackluster movie doesnt taint the amazing job theyve done with shazam
Mar 25 2023,positive,i am surprise it had bad reviews from critics  standard superhero fare to be sure and the first half hour is pretty weak not very credible dull narration few too many accents and it tends to jump quickly from one event to the next with no buildup or depth but overall it was a good movie and plenty entertaining for its audience   if i was being critical i would say that at no point did you think black adam was really bad or evil but in the story there is really no reason he should be in my opinion  good stuff ignore the critics and go with your gut  fun distraction for a couple of hours
Mar 25 2023,negative,never a fan of dc but this stinks
Mar 24 2023,positive,this was an entertaining  well acted well directed and well shot movie  its a super hero blockbuster not the grapes of wrath i dont usually leave reviews but i feel compelled to support the rock and henry cavil after the hit job hollywood its associated press is pulling im going to stop supporting projects with critical acclaim because of how clearly biased they are if there is a 50pt difference between critics and audience reviews then something is wrong
Mar 24 2023,negative,just awful painful to watch pierce brosnan wasted like this
Mar 24 2023,positive,decent rock is solid as the strong silent hero but this was not on par with other superhero movies too many unestablished characters detract from the movie 
Mar 23 2023,negative,very poor script writing even for a young teenager absolutely no imagination felt like i lost 2 precious hours of my life overkill and oversell all the way
Mar 23 2023,positive,great super hero movie loved it i dont know alot about the original comic book character but i liked the movie cannot wait to see atom and superman in a movie together
Mar 23 2023,positive,great movie loads of action not childish or corny
Mar 23 2023,positive,what a great movie great backstory great characters great heros great superheros great action great scifi great ending great valor heartbreaking greatest good against greatest evil great pastfuturepresent confluence great inspiration great people fighting for their home and freedom just plain great movie can watch over and over    amazing performance given the conflagrations in this country and in the world  good to remind people that they need to show courage and fight    what is wrong with the critics and bean counters  i really hope james gunn comes to his senses and makes more black adam movies at least a trilogy
Mar 23 2023,negative,surprisingly bad had rather low  soso expectations but this was just bad i loved shazam as a feel good popcorn entertainment and ive seen it twice this will not get a second viewing
Mar 23 2023,negative,dc needs to chill it with the ensemble character films and focus on introducing and developing fewer stronger characters this film was a hollow joke
Mar 23 2023,positive,meh is right it just didnt have that spark
Mar 22 2023,positive,the dc extended universe continues to fight for its survival with its 11th film this one follows an ancient superhuman known as teth adam who is released from his magic imprisonment by a group of archeologists to free the nation of kahndaq from the crime syndicate intergang whose local leader plans to obtain an ancient relic called the crown of sabbac to take control of the nation dwayne the rock johnson is incredibly charismatic in his role despite being an antihero the vfx team did an incredible job with the abundant actions scenes in this movie however the presence of unnecessary characters all of whom look like terrible ripoffs and the very standard superhero plot make the film a bit boring and repetitive it is entertaining to some extent but i expected more in terms of story and with the recent news of henry cavill leaving his role for good i dont see the point of the midcredits scene anymore this franchise lacks scope and vision
Mar 22 2023,positive,im not usually a fan of this kind of movie but i enjoyed this one the rock makes the movie
Mar 22 2023,positive,the film is great its by far one of the best cinematic superhero movies ever made it tells the story of a former slave who gets op powers  even though he starts off by slaughtering all his countrys captors he eventually turns into the dceus 2nd most op superhero just more violent i didnt like how the scriptwriter killed off dr fate though fate deserved better
Mar 22 2023,negative,i love the rock and superhero movies but this was a naw for me dawg cheesy boring random cast extremely forgettable characters tries to hard not funny
Mar 22 2023,neutral,thats was given the wrong clue but dont say the contents of this film im pretty close to the whole content
Mar 21 2023,negative,not so good  didnt quite follow the story  takes itself too seriously for a super hero movie
Mar 21 2023,positive,good action the rock played black adam perfect i thought he wasnt good or bad just doing what he thought was right and being very confused which im sure we all would be waking up a few thousand years later
Mar 21 2023,negative,as much charisma as the rock has it really isnt enough to save this movie while there were aspects of the movie i thoroughly enjoyed  piece brosnan as dr fate muah perfection aldis hodge was surprisingly amazing as hawkman and the cgi is very well done for the most part     most of the actions scenes though do seem clunky and at times even cheesy youd think a superhero movie with the rock would have incredible actions scene right but it falls flat most of the time     to be completely frank i think the character of black adam didnt warrant his own solo movie its a timepasser movie
Mar 21 2023,negative,really boring it had good fx but the storytelling was bad why show if you can tell was their premise there at most this was a movie for streaming services not for theaters material
Mar 21 2023,positive,great story smooth flow and transition of story amazing effects dwyane johnsons performance was awesome and he fit the role perfect must watch hope to see more black adam in the future
Mar 20 2023,positive,honestly one of the better dc movies solid 810 for sure
Mar 20 2023,positive,the movie couldnt figure out what it wanted to be or what direction it wanted to go
Mar 19 2023,negative,in my opinion the script was very generic at a level of the old 75 cent comics and that may be giving the story more credit than it deserves honestly its got no imagination and the director had no vision other than what was printed
Mar 19 2023,positive,definitely not a critics movie but enjoyable solid entertainment wellpaced good set pieces and an interesting dwayne johnson antihero
Mar 19 2023,positive,good fun and enjoyable worth every penny
Mar 19 2023,negative,the only interesting thing about this movie is playing script doctor once the credits role    hawkman and dr fate were the only beacons i could latch on to
Mar 18 2023,negative,terrible in every way  appalling acting the characters are insipid ripoffs i actually turned it off when i usually watch 99 of even rotten films until the end terrible shame worst  dc movie to date
Mar 18 2023,positive,great action but a story that leaves much to be desired
Mar 18 2023,positive,good movie i want to see next part soon
Mar 18 2023,positive,i really enjoyed it i dont think it was advertised enough the cast was amazing and the story line kept me pulled in
Mar 17 2023,positive,great movie i loved watching this and thought it was another good superhero movie i think the problem with other people is that whenever they see a superhero or antihero movie then they instantly compare it to marvel movies and become instantly disappointed when its not near that level therefore they make their reviews bad     brilliant performance from the cast the rock and pierce were the standouts love this movie
Mar 17 2023,positive,not the best movie ever but not bad a or pretty good action movie have to love and appreciate dwayne johnsons care for the movie and character glad he brought the justice society to the dceu amazing he brought and fought for henry cavil to return for the movie not the best dialogue but i didnt go for that anyway
Mar 17 2023,positive,everything dwayne johnson touches turns to gold   
Mar 16 2023,neutral,this is basically just the rock playing himself again justice society was the best part
Mar 16 2023,positive,black adam is a good movie to watch quietly its not a big deal its just good pierce brosnan and aldis hodge steal the show
Mar 16 2023,negative,omg what a mess i mean the world must be getting burning out by dwayne johnson the plotting was ridiculous the acting was subpar the writing was close to juvenile if you think this will ever take on the marvel universe you are sadly mistaken my advice for dwayne is take a few years off and give people a break im shocked your face isnt on my toilet paper
Mar 16 2023,positive,this was a refreshing take on superhero movies dwayne gave the movie a lighthearted but powerful aura and the story was exciting although it needed more parts the plot wasnt as plain as marvels civil war but instead had more depth to it that make it fun to watch despite me being a marvel fan i have to say this was my favorite movie in the genre
Mar 16 2023,positive,this was better than the critics gave it credit for  the rock was great as he always is
Mar 16 2023,negative,i could not watch it and after 30 minutes i stopped  mostly because there was background music all the time  it never stopped  drove me crazy
Mar 15 2023,negative,awful storyline the acting was also very poor quality the comedy also didnt feel right either overall a not very good movie i wouldnt recommend it
Mar 15 2023,positive,i didnt lose my interest and was magnetized to the screen for the whole duration so i can pretty much safely say it was banger dont listen to anyone make your own decision   it was worth my time
Mar 15 2023,positive,3  14 stars  this was an offbeat superhero flick  johnson played a dark being with super powers who slowly comes around to being a hero  lots of characters so i had to pay attention to sort out good v evil  action was continuous almost with stop
Mar 15 2023,positive,might be the best dc film ive seen
Mar 14 2023,positive,i thought the first act was good but the others were kinda a flop this had bad writing but the credits were good
Mar 14 2023,positive,great movie action packed great story line glad to see him involved with the other super heroes
Mar 14 2023,positive,the movie is a lot of fun  maybe not as serious as some super hero movies but often more fun and easier to watch  certainly a good time
Mar 14 2023,positive,great film could hv not hv the regular people in the way but still great film
Mar 13 2023,positive,everything was great about the movie except for  1 the angsty backstory behind black adam  tethadam  they couldve done without it and the movie wouldve been fine if not better  2 atom smasher  noah did well with what he was given but it is a shame that they turned the character into comedic relief  3 the dr fate  black adam matrixlike brawlfest  it was cool butdr fate as a character is not exactly the brawling type
Mar 13 2023,negative,i cant believe it has such a high non critic rating  another long origin story  he constantly saves on child   below average  not absolutely horrible
Mar 13 2023,neutral,wasnt a bad movie as such it just felt too generic i watched this movie like 4 months ago and cant even remember the villain they were so forgettable it was just a fun movie ig loved doctor fate sad he was a one movie thing
Mar 13 2023,positive,although some of the dialogue and acting was awkward and over the top it was a very entertaining movie if youre a fan of superhero movies it wont be your favorite but it will scratch the itch youre looking for
Mar 13 2023,positive,it was original creative and action packed this is a superhero story that was a fresh start to the dc world loved it from start to finish
Mar 13 2023,negative,stay away from this movie  absolutely nothing positive to say
Mar 13 2023,positive,an intro movie for a new character gets robbed by this need to include the same plot from every dc movie currently  we didnt need amanda waller or the justice society  also little to no tie in with the shazam movie  the whole universe theme is getting tiresome
Mar 13 2023,positive,as far as superhero movies go black adam is the best movies of this year hands down dwayne johnson has made original spectacle comparable to spider man 2 or iron man 1 or loki s1  it completely blewed marvels backdoor  and now with aquaman wonder woman and black adam  as set pieces dc as lover of marvel saying thisstands proudlyit certainly delivered with everything it could with top action and great story i felt like superheros  was cool again like watching thor being worthy or rogers saying avengers assemble   dc needs to realize that with this johnson made it possible for them to go at equal footing with marvel   i had no idea rock had it in him tbh   im gonna say just one thing after i left the cinema its been a long time since i though to myself that ticket was well spentcertainly got my moneys worth and that didnt happen since joker
Mar 11 2023,positive,imho mego  my eyes glaze over at another comic book style action super hero movie  3 rt stars for me meh it just passed the time  saw it lerton amc oct 292022
Mar 9 2023,positive,loved it    any movie with dwayne the rock johnson in is incredible
Mar 7 2023,negative,ok classic rock film not much substance to the plot
Mar 6 2023,negative,wow this movie was unwatchable im a comic fan from way back and this was awful utterly flat portrayal of the title character by a normally charismatic rock the singularly worst hawkman the tonally off atom smasher and cyclone and a complete misuse of dr fate  look at me take my helmet off again just so you can see my brosnan face the jsa as basically buffoons who lacked basic tactics or an ounce of intelligence in their approach to a crisis made me throw up my hands    the movie lacked any subtlety or decent dialogue or even something like a plot    like the most recent antman all spectacle and incredibly boring spectacle without any compelling story at all every moment was utterly derivative mouthy teenager protective mother boring monologues to explain the past stupid actions to release the villain blah blah    couldnt get through it even after two tries 12 star just because i did give it a second chance
Mar 6 2023,positive,i like this movie and dwayne johnson was good but this is not his type of movie to me it just didnt set right with me but love him in jumanji
Mar 5 2023,negative,the scripts and dialogues on this movie are so bad but so bad that i cant begin to understand the audience score on this it seems that im watching a script written by a bad ai the actors are struggling to say the dialogues emthey were ordered to say and it shows
Mar 4 2023,positive,this was a nice change in pace for dc movies too bad they are dismantling the current team the movie was full of action with some subtle humor
Mar 4 2023,neutral,it was very mid a fine decent movie i thought it was entertaining but the story was a mess and there was a large amount of exposition a liveaction cartoon a major letdown watch it if you want but at its best its just a superhero movie nothing special
Mar 4 2023,positive,must see the new dceu is shaping up
Mar 4 2023,positive,i was let down by it in the way that i was expecting it to be way better that being said id did think it was a good movie and would recommend it
Mar 2 2023,negative,i didnt like it at all the fight scenes were ok but the story line is just bad and i found the movie boring to watch it didnt peak any interest
Mar 2 2023,positive,its a big budget blockbuster action based superhero movie replete with all the tropes minus the racial ones kudos writers directors and actors special effects characters and fight sequences the genre has developed over the past n decades    do we receive significant character development during the movie no all of the characters are introduced through their actions save the titular character i wouldnt credit him with being the protagonist per se black adam who singularly receives a backstory treatment i can tell you by conserving the screen time audience participation and production resources in this manner the movie is much better for it    maybe youre big on character development but youve gone to see an action based superhero movie the only real question surrounding characters for this genre is are the characters engaging enough to carry the action and propel the story forward in this instance yes they are actions are well motivated plot devices are direct and uncomplicated but with sufficient texture to be engaging overall there is continuity throughout the characters do their job and both characters and context mesh well    action in this movie is very well paced and well choreographed special fx are omnipresent as youd expect in a big budget superhero movie but they are implemented faultlessly they enhance the action never interfere with the pacing and support the character identities at every step truly a credit to the director and the fx teams    finally getting to the acting  which shows its true comparative import in a superhero movie  its unobtrusive which is fantastic pierce brosnan doesnt come across pierce brosnany dripping with oleaginous sarcastic smarm the rock isnt covering the set with facetiousness an exaggerated pastiche of manhood or a single high arched eyebrow the chap who plays the hawk who fortunately isnt overly burdened with typecast black american hype lines does a dignified and deft job throughout by avoiding any tropes and instead creating his character from within     the rest of supporting cast are perfectly in tune with their parts as support characters and work together exceptionally well in fact this cast works together so seamlessly in this film that their performance as a group defiantly builds a defensive bubble around our suspension of disbelief fantastic     the sole performance highlights go to viola davis whose cameos are like punctuation for the movie a colon after after a brief introduction at the start and a period at the end again perfection    if you want an interesting character piece or some sort of meaning of life business or anything verging on social political or psychological commentary illumination or analysis  this is not your genre dont bicker that you didnt receive the meaning of life from a childrens comic thats neither their purpose nor the creators intent     if i was personally a big fan of the action based superhero genre instead of feeling a tiredness about it all id give this movie more like 445 stars however the genre is starting to show its maturity and all the films are beginning to feel a little passé the sad fact is this you cannot combine big budget action sweeping context and modern fx with deep character pieces try eating a caramel covered steak and youll get why its infeasible    for what it is this is an excellent example of the genre and perhaps my 35 stars is a little conservative but im getting old so bah
Mar 1 2023,positive,i was very slow but has a lot of funnygreat moments
Mar 1 2023,positive,suboptimal story with okay acting i believe that d johnson is the right face for black adam feels like the studio let him down on this one
Mar 1 2023,positive,it was ok felt like something was missing i was expecting this big super hero story kinda was but i wasnt expecting him to portrayed as bad     i watched it till the end so thats good haha
Mar 1 2023,positive,it was much better than the critics reviews which i thought were a bit harsh the ultimate judges the audience scored it much higher and i agree
Mar 1 2023,positive,i saw it on the plane the cgi and action was really good this movie surprised me sure the plot might have been shitty but i mean the action and some of the funny dialogues were top notch have become suspicious of critic reviews and focus on audience reviews since they seem more acurate as an aggregate
Mar 1 2023,positive,i rarely listen to critics reviews and i didnt listen at all with black adam it was a great fun movie i enjoyed it also loved henry cavills post credit scene wish he was still playing superman i am extremely disappointed with that
Feb 28 2023,positive,i think people wanted to hate this movie before ever seeing it it is a pretty solid story and a casual watching experience some things may be a little off as the comics go but hey thats just what movies are going to do all in all it was a very well made film
Feb 28 2023,negative,weak plot cheesy lines way too much cgi i had trouble enduring until the end
Feb 28 2023,negative,the special effects are solid but this is not a good movie the script is just brutal from awful dialogue to a predictable and silly plot    lot of movies in the world and this just isnt nearly as fun as youd expect
Feb 28 2023,positive,a dumb fun action movie and with some comedy
Feb 27 2023,positive,excellent movie of course i am a big dwayne johnson fan
Feb 27 2023,positive,doctor fate  hawkman outshined black adam in his own movie despite that rock was great as black adam throughout the film this movie is a bit overheated in my opinion but its not the greatest of all time either i would put it at about the same level as iron man 3 in terms of comic book movies some of the cgi couldve used a little more work too
Feb 26 2023,neutral,mid dr fate and hawkman are my favorite and the bestin imo part of this film
Feb 25 2023,positive,although the movie was fast paced it makes sense for dc even so it was a great movie and dwayne johnson played israel perfectly and it seems like he also had taken a few things from his previous roles like scorpion king he is truly a person worth of a kingly role
Feb 25 2023,positive,this movie was great i dont know what the critics are smoking
Feb 25 2023,positive,the plot of the film would have been more encaputring if the lead role had been played by someone else although i am usually a huge fave of johnsons movies i dont think he was the right call for black adam
Feb 24 2023,negative,boooooring the storyline was mediocre the characters uninteresting  the scenes where the girl whose power was wind seemed to have been filmed once and then the same shot shown over and over when she used her power the awkward young man i didnt even bother learning their names added a tiny bit of humour the bad guy seemed to have been an afterthought  good thing i had my knitting with me or it would have been a total waste of my time
Feb 24 2023,positive,loved this movie great action and comedy i feel the bad ratings are in direct correlation with the way dc is handling the snyderverse if the story was to continue and the battle with the justice league and superman with black adam as the anti hero needed to balance that battle out i believe the rating are swayed by disappointment
Feb 23 2023,positive,i would say it was the same level as black panther plot was interesting had some action but it still needed more work before realising
Feb 23 2023,positive,this movie made me feel a lot of drive and power all the time i watched this movie i was hungry and i devoured i put in the work and the hour and i also took whats ours
Feb 23 2023,positive,the dc cinematic landscape is changing and the new leadership have decided to take an entirely different direction can i blame them no while ive enjoyed most the movies thatve come out im in the minority that being said what do i think of the latest release black adam its good not great johnson does a great job bringing the character to life despite the movies lackluster plot that feels a little been there done that as a matter of fact hes the main reason the movie works as well as it does but hes not alone the supporting cast do their best even if their involvement felt a little uneven at times and after watching the movie i can see why they left the villain out of the trailers the villain felt more like an afterthought than anything     if course this is has been par for the course for the dc cinematic universe up to this point little if any substance now you tell me whats your favorite dc character ps as i was finishing writing this review dwayne johnson put out a press release stating dc films is moving away from him as black adam
Feb 22 2023,positive,i loved this movie i thought it was well written the rock was terrific i am disappointed that there will not be more of them finally a character i could get behind since iron man and bam its over 
Feb 22 2023,positive,i like the actors and the fight scenes but the plot is too simple and lacks suspense for an antihero story
Feb 22 2023,positive,no the hierarchy of power in the dc universe did not change with the introduction of black adam this was a very mediocre film and felt like a very colour by numbers superhero film designed and tested to please as many audiences as possible meaning it plays it safe and doesnt take any risks but i enjoyed it its a very entertaining watch with lots of huge setpieces in fact once it gets going it doesnt stop its a nonstop actionpacked thrill ride its only problem  its so average something weve seen a million times before it almost left me feeling a bit of superhero fatigue as everything just felt recycled i kept waiting for it to do something fresh and new and while there were a few good moments overall the movie was incredibly predictable i even had moments wishing the action would slow down so we could get another dialogue scene or something that would flesh out the characters more the script just isnt great frankly but its still a good time i think of it like this black adam is a bad movie held together by some awesome moments    so lets get these negatives out of the way the script is extremely weak and very predictable heck the trailers even spoiled a twist near the middle of the film its not hard to figure out what the movie is doing especially for those of us whove seen a lot of these superhero movies over the years it doesnt try all that hard to keep eventual reveals hidden as its more focused on giving its protagonist the flashiest most murderfilled debut in the dceu even though i would look to the suicide squad for that it really felt like the creative team saw black adam being an antihero as an excuse to let them have the character kill everyone it felt so overplayed and obnoxious like they were trying to say see look how brutal we can make this without actually earning the audiences investment the scenes where black adam just goes around dominating everyone just felt empty like sure it was cool to see him be so powerful and instantly kill people but it took all the tension out of the scenes it felt like they were beating me over the head with look how powerful and ruthless he is the novelty of it wore off very quickly too so thank god the film introduces the justice society pretty quick they did make the smart choice of making this equal parts a justice society film as they did a black adam film and i gotta say while i did find the character of black adam quite interesting it was the justice society mainly hawkman and doctor fate that i loved    its when the justice society comes in that the movie remembers how fun exciting superhero stories can be i enjoyed their part in the story the most and instantly loved the characters pierce brosnans doctor fate was awesome it was so cool to see brosnan in a superhero role he did feel a little reminiscent of a certain marvel doctor but thats okay because they both have some cool scenes fate had some of the most memorable in the film hawkman was also pretty badass i really hope to see these characters again and i gotta say i did love dwayne johnson as black adam he suits the role very well and id love to see this iteration of the character return im just not sure how i feel about him in this movie it makes him look cool and all and johnsons physique is perfect for the character but he had almost no story like they introduced his backstory and everything but once the movie got going it never stopped to examine his character we never understood how he felt about anything which made him just come across as an uncharming sociopath this is especially unusual for johnson as we all know how undeniably charismatic he can be and he just isnt here but damn he sure is magnetic and does command the screen with his hulking form and brooding looks the only cast members i didnt like and this was more because of the way their characters were written were adrianna and her son they really did not work for me and made some really dumb decisions throughout the movie and had some very cringey scenes but luckily that was only a minor part there was some cool cameos too surprisingly from james gunns the suicide squad and of course a certain cast member from shazam i did love these little connections its nice to see the dceu try to be interconnected again and the shazam stuff was awesome it showed some things i wished we got to see in that movie and how could i forget there was one other cameo i did really love its definitely the worst kept secret in hollywood but made for an awesome end credit scene and made this fan very happy    the filmmaking here is abysmal jaume colletserra has never made a great movie instead making blevel movies at the studio level and this might just be proof he is not capable of directing films of this scale he makes every moment feel mundane from black adam going on a killing spree to the big fight between the jsa and black adam these moments should feel engaging and cool but instead just bored me frankly it feels like he is trying so hard to show spectacle but he ultimately fails making it all feel cheap and generic i also couldnt stand the cinematography it seems like they shot the film to look like zack snyders 300 with bland colours and lots and lots of annoying slomo at least the cgi was good there were some moments that had their flaws but overall this movie has some awesome cgi and a seemingly obligatory cgi filled 3rd act dont even get me started on the truly awful sound mix it just felt like sound was being blared in my face for 2 hours and i couldnt discern what i was hearing it just sounded messy the score isnt memorable instead it just sounds like a jumble of notes and digital instrumentation it has no emotional core to the music and it is just noise even the dialogue is not mixed well but thats okay because the dialogue is horrendous anyways    so why after all that complaining did i ultimately enjoy myself while watching well because it has enough cool moments that i came out satisfied i have never seen a movie so bad that i still enjoyed this much its remarkable how well a few moments and ideas can make for an enjoyable viewing experience the disappointing part of this is if only they put the good moments together in better ways this could have been an awesome film but instead it misses so many opportunities there was one moment that really stands out to me because it made me want to cheer however and that was the awesome reference to the good the bad and the ugly i feel like many superhero fans will miss that reference but for me as a cinephile that scene quickly became my favourite in the film the film felt like it was made in the 90s before the mcu before xmen before superhero flicks became popular back when they were still trying to figure them out it was just all over the place and it also happened to be pretty derivative of other films avatar black panther and captain america the first avenger especially but despite all my issues i have with this film  and i have many  it somehow still managed to entertain me and leave me satisfied by the time it was over possibly because of the awesome endcredit scene it was kind of like venom just some mindless superhero fun i wish it was a better movie because it did have some awesome elements but as a film it ultimately fails i would like to see more of dwayne johnsons black adam especially in a potential black adam v superman movie he keeps talking about with some improvements it could be a much better movie than this while still being entertaining
Feb 22 2023,negative,its a passable superhero movie but just nothing necessarily original great to see some of these dc characters come to life
Feb 21 2023,neutral,the costumes look cheap and the many cgi action scenes seem to go nowhere  theres kind of a vague anticolonial message too  dcs c list heroes youll wish it was over long before you get there  generic beyond belief
Feb 20 2023,negative,miscast on so many levels   kid on his skateboard was good so many invincible  superheroes these days  capt marvel superman shazam do we really need another   no energy source or means of flight make it phonier than normal  and yet more new ones thrown in the mix  a solid story of someone who is vulnerable and relatable rising above his limits is much better think batman or the first iron man movie  something positive theme music was not bad
Feb 20 2023,negative,this film really very very bad
Feb 20 2023,positive,i thought it would be difficult to make a good story with black adam because hes kind of a bad guy but they made it happen great affects  hawkman was a fury of awesome and pierce brosnan with the classy touch in one dcs most awesome characters well done 
Feb 20 2023,positive,good for a dc superhero movie it was a little stiff but if you like the superhero movies its worth the watch
Feb 20 2023,positive,the rock and pierce bronson were good the special effects were ok the story was kind of lame and the final fight with the villian was goofy worth watching once there are better superhero movies out there im a rock fan and he did ok in this film
Feb 20 2023,negative,this movie wad generic and dewayne johnson did not fit the role if it was made 15 to 20 years ago and a different actor wad playing black adam it would have probably done better
Feb 19 2023,positive,the film is very attractive because it has a lot of and very good action very very amazing and amusing
Feb 19 2023,positive,this movie is great it is a special effects showcase great supporting actors pierre brosnan balanced the most boring dialogue with fun comments every funny moment was very right timed dwayne johnson played this well as a character that does not need to speak very much as the black adam character is a dark one the part when hes describing what really happened is really good  cant wait to see more
Feb 19 2023,positive,its watchable not great cause as always major destruction is happening and you send c list heroes to stop it
Feb 19 2023,negative,i am not sure why rock acted in this movie so basic at several levels cgi is great and thats about it week and childish dialogues it was a pain to watch even
Feb 19 2023,positive,no spoilers     the movie has a lot of potential   the main character is he evil  neutral or good the moving pacing story is from beginning to almost the end really ok     personally i find the end that the choices how the story goes should be a bit different the moving pacing is switched to very fast near the end making the movie feeling rushed at that part
Feb 19 2023,positive,the overall movie wasnt bad its setting up something interesting for dc but the end credits scene was the best part but like typical dc fashion they ruined the hope of cavill returning
Feb 18 2023,positive,solid action film that moves at a brisk pace the villain is a bit silly but the side characters provide humor and the justice society is a lot of fun black adam hearkens back to early 2000s superhero films that were just designed to be busy loud actionpacked fun
Feb 18 2023,positive,wasnt great  want awful seen it once im good
Feb 18 2023,negative,bad very very bad
Feb 17 2023,positive,critics are too harsh on this film not the greatest movie ever made but a great movie to watch with popcorn
Feb 17 2023,negative,all the hype on tv and promos was a bad bad let down this was just a play on the already too too many comic book movies already being put out each week if you took away dwayne johnson as the lead character and the stunning visual effects that have to be present on literally every frame of the movie you left with a story so thin that if it were a bucket it will never hold water and there is no real reason for the crown other than showing off a prop that some intern made up i really had higher hopes than this b rate script the screenwriters delivered and the director put in as much effort as if he were being hazed for a fraternity dwayne johnson deserves better hes a great guy and an awesome actor and i really enjoyed his other bodies of work there are already too too many comic booksuper hero movies already how about coming up with a plausible story people will enjoy and not just watch as mindless zombies
Feb 17 2023,positive,expectedly entertaining action packed and great visuals  a shame rock wont be continuing in the dcu  not even as a shazam vs
Feb 17 2023,positive,if you like watching movies where there is action from the begining to the end then black adam is the movie you are looking for all the action give the movie life and makes it enjoyable and it is not always the same people  that fights black adam build upbackstory was very short they could have given us more knowledge about black adam black adam lacks story you dont get any story about the other characters just a little about black adam and nothing more honestly the action very good and that saves this movie
Feb 17 2023,positive,dwayne johnson and company breathed new life into the dc universe with black adam  and oh that sweet ending i cant wait to see what comes next
Feb 17 2023,positive,i enjoyed watching it i personally think that dwayne johnson is the perfect actor for this role
Feb 16 2023,negative,i hope they not try do another one
Feb 16 2023,positive,amazing would definitely recommend 
Feb 15 2023,negative,was really looking forward to the movie but it was a huge dissapointment the cast wasnt good except for the uncle the writting and storyline was weak overall just a bad and dissapointing movie
Feb 14 2023,positive,it will a solid movie at 1st i wasnt sure but then when i gave it a chance it was actually quite good black adam him self was very good character as well as hawk man i think his passion in the movie to take on black adam and not backing down what honestly made me like him more 1010 movie for me
Feb 14 2023,positive,it was a good action movie and had a lot of funny parts and had a good story behind it
Feb 14 2023,positive,very entertaining i love how the storyline went by full of action and heroic scenes just what i want in a superhero movie fun and entertaining
Feb 13 2023,positive,it was ok funny and awesome i liked it but it wasnt the best movie 7510
Feb 13 2023,positive,i loved it dwayne was sexy as always super suspenseful i thought the movie was ending with an ending i did not love then boom it keeps going with a great ending
Feb 11 2023,positive,amazing movie dont understand why there are so many negative reviews haters i say the move was excellent i was glued to the screen the entire time 
Feb 11 2023,positive,why is everyone dogging this movie i mean its no batman but it is what it is a comicbook movie
Feb 11 2023,negative,boring generic  hodge and brosnan tried to carry this sludge but the poor script and poor acting of the backup teenage cast was too much weight  glad this mess got cancelled  bring us a superhero that is actually ok with losing a fight to build some tension
Feb 11 2023,positive,great movie very close to a masterpiece good effects good character development despite a plethora of new and interesting characters will keep you entertained from start to finish
Feb 11 2023,positive,very good to watch characters were likeable story kept you engaged
Feb 10 2023,negative,absolutely useless movie everything is cheap about it jokes acting  cgi
Feb 10 2023,negative,super interesting visually super silly and hard to take serious if you think too much about what is happening
Feb 10 2023,positive,i know some people didnt like it but i thought it was good for what it was dwayne johnson always shines and the black adam story line was what i expected ive been a fan of hodge since leverage and brosnan is brosnan i mean come on overall i thought it was good for a dcu movie
Feb 10 2023,negative,excesive use of cgi catch phrases and common places i watched it on a plane and was glad i didnt pay full price to watch it
Feb 9 2023,neutral,usa army invades some thirdworld country with no reason at all and when they defend themselves usa calls them a terrorists and kill them anyway but with that excuse    average rocks fairytale movie but for kids under 15 years of age
Feb 9 2023,negative,so boring get it donewas able to finish the movie in 2 goes enough of super hero movies with no interesting plots
Feb 8 2023,positive,good movie typical dc or mcu storyline but that is ok well acted and casted with good special effects it moved right along and kept my interest throughout i would like to see a follow up movie maybe tying in zachary levys shazam or the new superman
Feb 8 2023,neutral,i have a very mixed opinion of this film     on the one side i did not like the rock playing the role of black adam even although he may not have done it tremendously bad it is very difficult to imagine him being black adam instead of a jacked lifeguard it was very difficult to believe in him and his serious statements seemed more like a bad joke moreover the film did not righteously develop the history behind the characters that played in it but it felt more like throwing characters into the screen and wishing that they would shine by themselves     on the other hand they did really have a nice idea in bringing new characters into the screen dr fate and hawkman did really make an impression on me even leaving me with the desire of seeing a movie with them as protagonists telling their origins and conflicts sadly the new dc cinematographic universe will forget about them as usual
Feb 7 2023,negative,this movie could have been fantastic visually it was stunning the heroes and villains awesome well crafted and exciting  that said the writing i think literally made me want to vomit a little bit in my mouth swallow and then vomit again just so i had something to distract myself from the fantastically stupid dialogue and rancid cliche plot points all told watch it with the sound off you might be happier with it
Feb 6 2023,positive,awesome and action packed its a shame that dc comics fired henry cavill and dwayne johnson because i was hoping to see a movie with zachary levii shazam and henry cavill superman fighting dwayne johnson black adam
Feb 6 2023,positive,it was definitely a fun stepup from several other dc movies introducing a very powerful morally standoffish main hero the movie overall is very enjoyable to watch with friends and family my particular group i watched it with had a great time with it
Feb 6 2023,negative,another super hero movie that is so scattered in story and obvious with the cgi  moving from action scene to action scene with tidbits of story thrown in  at least this one kept me up
Feb 6 2023,positive,it was decent i guess
Feb 6 2023,neutral,c  trite predictable noninteresting characters
Feb 6 2023,positive,awesome movie the rock played a great antihero one last great dc movie before james gunn turns it into a snore fest 
Feb 5 2023,positive,movie is as very interesting action and adventure history upon some great heroes fighting in past time it gets clear some ideas and doubts about heroes and their stories trying safe people they like in the movie for sure is an excellent movie experience
Feb 5 2023,positive,critics are stupid  this was great movie  i lived the heroes they used i liked the pacing and the rock was a bad ass  what did people really want  marvel  nah this was a good flick that had great action and a fun story  it was very much a comic book movie  it deserves better
Feb 5 2023,positive,this was the first movie from dc that i thought i was watching a marvel movie i would prefer authenticity if it is going to be cheesy anyway
Feb 4 2023,positive,i thought it was a great movie i dont know what people were complaining about it was 10000x better than jl by joss whedon i hear people complaining about as if it stinks and yet its nothing like that lets enjoy good movie and great match up guys its a damn comic book its such a shame that we lost henry cavills superman and possibly the rocks black adam
Feb 4 2023,negative,disappointing but somewhat entertaining bad character writing
Feb 4 2023,positive,i dont understand all the crap this movie is getting i liked it found it entertaining like the rock like the superman like the story a win for me
Feb 4 2023,positive,one of the better dc movies good way to end a horrible franchise
Feb 4 2023,positive,this movie with was awesome  sure hope they make a  sequel
Feb 3 2023,negative,it was boring and no character development bad dialogue poor acting mismanagement all around for the whole movie the only good things was when atom smasher got talked to like a child by the bird person i watched it at least three times hoping it would be good at least once im giving it a generous 1 star
Feb 3 2023,positive,i i guess its alright it has some really cool action great humor and the justice society are great which i cant say about adam himself while he is hilarious especially when he just hovers through walls but there is nothing else interesting about him its fun but its not a lot more the kid was also kind of annoying i wasnt pissed of when he was on screen but just once again just not interesting there is nothing more to say want to turn your brain off and watch a movie well then this is the movie for you
Feb 3 2023,positive,possibly one of if not the best dc movie to date i would love to see more like a sequel with zachary levis shazam and henry cavills superman but unfortunately dumb people were put in charge of dc movies and theyre cancelling a great franchise i was really looking forward to i wont be going to see any dc movie after shazam 2 im going to miss the dceu
Feb 2 2023,neutral,good superhero movie 
Feb 2 2023,positive,great movie to entertain the story is interesting and the actors were incredibly talented
Feb 1 2023,positive,it had a few good moments the slow motion fights were a good touch but the  dialogue was awful the storyline jumped from moment to moment without any kind of smooth transition without any backstory in most of the scenes that were central to the character and the story as a whole its quite the disappointment i was really looking forward to this one
Feb 1 2023,positive,the action and cinemaphotography was great and seemless aaa for that    but the actors lacked chemistry i have seen most of them act much better in other films and have great chemistry with other casts but this movie was bland in regards to the forced slap stick comedy of the growing guy very sloppy screen writing the best acting was the mother and child they had great chemistry with each other and a touch with black adam but not enough the save the film
Feb 1 2023,negative,i just cant i swear the plot was just thrown together at the end the unbreakable crown broke and this sunburned demon goat wannabe started screaming and stuff then apparently the dr strange from carigslist started speaking to black adam in his mind told him to go and save the world this skinny guy floating in the middle of glaciers while he is unconscious whispers shazam and then he like transforms bro what is going on there is so much happening in this movie at one time it makes it impossible to follow also when the kid was fighting zombies with a stick the mom sent her son to get all the towns people that are in the same place the kid then does some stuff with his hands returning with more people carrying sticks dude wears khakis the entire movie and the towns people just give him the leadership why dont waiste ur money lower your expectations to zero
Jan 31 2023,negative,the speech by the kid near the end set cinema back many years
Jan 31 2023,positive,in 2600 bc the tyrannical king ahkton of kahndaq creates the crown of sabbac to attain great power after attempting to stage a revolt a young slave boy is given the powers of shazam by the council of wizards transforming him into kahndaqs heroic champion who fights ahkton killing him and ending his reign in the present day kahndaq is oppressed by the intergang a mercenary organization as adrianna tomaz an archaeologist and resistancefighter tries to locate the crown of sabbac with the help of her brother karim and their colleagues samir and ishmael as adrianna obtains the crown intergang ambushes them and kills samir forcing adrianna to read an incantation that awakens tethadam dwayne johnson whom she believes to be kahndaqs champion from a slumber as he slaughters most of the intergang troops us government official amanda waller deems adam a threat and contacts the justice society to apprehend him justice society members hawkman doctor fate pierce brosnan cyclone and atom smasher arrive in time to stop adams killing spree and explain to adrianna that adam was not an entombed savior but an imprisoned killer    rotten tomatoes and deseret news called film reviews mixed while variety yahoo news and common sense media stated the film received negative reviews rotten tomatoes critics consensus reads black adam may end up pointing the way to an exciting future for dc films but as a standalone experience its a wildly uneven letdown katie walsh of the los angeles times wrote the director does heroic work crafting a film around johnson that is fast and entertaining writing for consequence liz shannon miller gave the film a b grade and said on its own merits black adam might feel a little thin in terms of story but it does deliver plenty of enjoyable moments and a solid ensemble to back up johnson but perhaps the most exciting aspect of it is how it might shake up the rest of the franchise going forward helen ohara of empire rated it 3 out of 5 and wrote that the film attempts to offer a grand unified theory of dc mixing familyfilm tropes with a protagonist who straightup murders people the result is sometimes a mess but its a generally entertaining one todd mccarthy of deadline hollywood praised johnsons performance and the action scenes writing the visual spectacle just keeps coming at you for two hours and the effects are all so stupendous that you could begin to take it for granted practically every shot features something epic or at least unusual going on and director jaume colletserra who guided johnsons 2021 hit jungle cruise takes good care to present the star in the most favorable dramatic light maya phillips of the new york times was more critical in her review calling the film a dull listless superhero movie that hits all the expected touchstones of the genre under the guise of a transgressive new antihero story rachel labonte of screen rant gave the film a 25 out of 5 and wrote though suffering from repetitive plot beats and thin characters black adam is powered by johnsons performance and its promise of an exciting future thewraps alonso duralde called the film a muddled overstuffed origin story and wrote most disappointing of all black adam is one of the most visually confounding of the majorstudio superhero sagas between cg thats assaultively unappealing and rapidfire editing that sucks the exhilaration right out of every fight scene via wikipedia    black adam is nothing more than another dc failure if you ask me dwayne johnson is larger than life as tethadam or black adam which fits his real personality i guess its one gigantic visually boombastic saga that suffers from repetition and as mentioned wafer thin characters you simply dont care about as marvel dc does adjustments to characters and their realm which is not always working as in this case black adam has too many characters not much of a backstory unbalanced acting wobbly humour wobbly editing and cgi all over the place that more or less becomes the main pillar in the film and not the storyline no need to see black adam
Jan 30 2023,positive,black adam gives us back a bit of snyders essence and the truth is that it is enjoyed in a perfect way he further expands the dceu for us with new characters and at the same time brings us characters we already knew with a mixture of action and seriousness it can be concluded that it is a very enjoyable movie
Jan 30 2023,positive,dwayne johnson gives a great performance  the other actors not so much movie is fun to watch although soundtrack could have been better
Jan 30 2023,negative,horribly executed painful to watch
Jan 29 2023,positive,perfectly cast and great story never trust a rotten tomato critic score theyre often wrong this is the best dc movie to come out lets hope we get to see more
Jan 29 2023,positive,eh it was kind of like the rest of the dc universe just kind of meh nothing too big here the acting was ok though not the greatest the special effects were pretty good but the story and the illogical way people acted to make the plot move forward was just silly better then most of the dc movies but still leaving a lot to be desired
Jan 29 2023,positive,i absolutely loved this movie the back story was great at creating a solid origin story for black adam im not a huge rock fan but he was really great in this role such a shame that this story is now over with james gunn as much as saying so     awesome movie though
Jan 29 2023,positive,my husband and i had avoided watching this movie because it had horrible reviews but i saw it playing on the tv at a gas station through the window and it looked great so when we got home we watched it and it is now one of our favorite movies this movie is great for anyone who said it sucks theyve prob been paid to say it or are just haters because this movies doesnt suck at all its freakin awesome and i dont even like the rock after his social media team deleted a very positive response i made on his instagram profile during the riots anyways this movie is great
Jan 28 2023,positive,overall a very fun and action packed movie though they should have told us more about hawkman and doctor fate
Jan 28 2023,positive,decent action needs more fate
Jan 28 2023,negative,its ok but sometimes if they make to many it sucks so i think its bad to do a movie copied from shazam fury of the gods so it kinda sucks just saying really bad for a lot of actors even the kid actor is bad and horrible acting
Jan 28 2023,negative,the rock should have stayed in wrestling he did not fit the part he might have been good if he would have got a part in the film the suicide squad but he didnt the film was not worth the price of the admission he should drop the rock that he earned in the wwe and get a part you earned and using his name instead of a nickname the cgi ape in the film rampage is a better actor
Jan 27 2023,negative,my ocd acting up bro
Jan 27 2023,positive,a fun dwayne johnson action movie with not much more the justice society was the highlight l specially dr fate and hawk man black adam as a character is decent there are some stand out moments with proper emotion and stakes but still just a plain old dwayne johnson thriller a good time for that type of crowd now there is a post credit scene with a certain super someone which upon first viewing was insane but now that we know the dceu is being rebooted it is not nearly as cool sadly but thats just my opinion
Jan 27 2023,positive,this film is outstanding it is visually outstanding with suits that make you feel alive in the dceu this is the 4th dceu villan film i am a big fan of this one dwayne johnson acting was outstanding the other actors werent as good sadly this film is very underrated guys there are characters we have never or rarely seen on the big screen we shouldshould appreciate the visuals marvel couldnt beat this title i have worked with marvel before and they are very good at making films this is a step up from justice league 2017 and suicide squad 2016
Jan 27 2023,positive,i ve always been a fan of shazam and black adam so the movie was good for me but it f i cared about the comics i would not have liked it as much due to the differences in actual black adam he was a bad guy not in the evil sense of the word but just he didnt care about other things the rock did real good he didnt raise his eyebrow once and kept the demeanor of adam i loved brosnan as dr fate another all time favorite character from the comics all good action with a good story and cool fx
Jan 27 2023,positive,i have always a fan of black adam that being said i watch the movie my rule is not to bring my opinion or judgment with me i got some popcorn and was entertain and enjoy the movie with some of my favorite character in the dc comics rock was awesome the only actor that can pull the role off a superhero custom off without any padding in it sad to hear that it is going another direction with james gunn
Jan 27 2023,positive,i honestly have no idea why people dont like this movie its really good i love the fact that they show that blind justice is anything but actual justice theres some seriously good social commentary here that really makes the story hit you hard at points and i absolutely love dwayne johnson and pierce brosnan in this movie
Jan 27 2023,positive,this movie was different and very good and a different take on a super hero movie  hawkman and doctor fate were excellently cast and played  atom smasher was also good just not at the level of the other two  the superman cameo was awesome and teased a movie everyone would love to see but wb is too silly to make because they only make the lead in movies and spend blockbuster money on them only to pull the plug on the cash cow  the reviews that say this movie was bad didnt actually sit down and watch and give it a fair chance
Jan 27 2023,positive,fun clever movie with a complex subtext first super heroes dont have to be heroes two middle east countries have had a string of foreign invaders perhaps they should be allowed selfdetermination like every other country beyond the subtext the last piece of the dc puzzle is creating complex villains villains who are not evil but misguided heroes
Jan 26 2023,negative,who are these people that liked this movie hahah i mean the rock is atrocious hes suppose to be from egypt but he has an american accent just cast a real actor not to mention all the other nonsense theres too much here to even digest dont waste your time 
Jan 26 2023,positive,incredible interesting and full of action and emotion since the start the characters are all significant giving each moment tension and hope for their wellbeing and the potential of black adam combined with the situation of his people made me feel sooo excited to see him become the hero they needed if dc has a subscription of comics i will totally swap mvels one for a while just to see more of black adam
Jan 26 2023,positive,ive watched this movie twiceand i still could not tell you what the plot is but it was fun to watch the rock kick ass  take names
Jan 25 2023,negative,i really fell asleep twice
Jan 25 2023,positive,a good introduction movie create a little things new for the gender
Jan 25 2023,positive,lot of bad press about this for some reason honestly its really good and would have been a great way to kick start the dc universe hope they keep the movie canon
Jan 25 2023,positive,is an excelent movie grat effects no wonderfull strory have so much action since the begining was exciting except for the hawkman he had a lot of innecesary time in the screen
Jan 24 2023,negative,this movie is very disappointing  every actor in this is not doing a very great job in this every line the hawkman has is funnythe effects are meh they are alright some look really good some look like effects from 2015 or somethingthe only thing i like about the film is the effort because at least it kinda had a storybut the effects look so funny sometimes to like the zoom in on rocks face is funny and rock as black adam i like the rock but every line he has is not good its cringeits just a mess of a film for me dont watch it will if you have kids they might like it but this is a pass for me
Jan 24 2023,positive,i really liked it i loved the rock playing black adam and him going against the demons the villain was awesome looking that was cool i love how story was in different country to   the main 3 actors were fantasticgreat choices  i wish they didnt cancel it because the second one could of been even better when they fixed some of the mishaps like i didnt like the good guys going against black adam at first seemed cheesyalthough the hawk character annoyed me in this movie the actor was awesome playing him   pierce bronson was good in itliked his character i wish there was a second one to see dwayne johnson playing him again in an even better story i loved him as black adam noone could play black adam better and seeing him with superman henry cavill the best superman ever would have been cool to watch i was very disappointed to hear all the bad choices removing henry cavill and no more black adam so sad would have been incredible to see them acting together and possibly becoming a team
Jan 24 2023,negative,thw ritting and the plot of the movie were horrible
Jan 24 2023,positive,cool story excellent effects and action nice twist ending  really liked it
Jan 24 2023,positive,it was a great movie but not the best dc made still i enjoyed it and think if they had made one more maybe it could been even better and answered several questions about the story i feelt was missing
Jan 24 2023,negative,i fell asleep because it was that boring
Jan 24 2023,positive,so freaking good 
Jan 24 2023,positive,ive heard about some poor reviews and the 39 from the critics but it is unwarranted in my opinion i think that they have something here it is a good movie ignore the hate and watch it you will like it
Jan 24 2023,positive,i thought the movie was pretty good i didnt even consider turning it off good story line good action and good ending i dont know why the critics cant see movies for what they are any longer but this was a darn good movie
Jan 23 2023,neutral,rock thinks he is better than he actually is what a joke
Jan 23 2023,negative,this was beyond mediocre weak story weak side characters and im not looking forward to seeing it again
Jan 23 2023,positive,i hate super hero movies  but black adam was crazy so much going on and wow he is one badass dude
Jan 23 2023,neutral,not knowing the background of the main heroes made it hard to get invested in the movie it just seemed pretty slapped together some of the effects are pretty cool though
Jan 23 2023,positive,very much enjoyed the movie the rock was great as black adam story line was easy to follow and had great on point special effects watched it 3 times now first time in the theater will watch it again was so happy to see henry cavill as superman at the end of the movie was set up for a great 2nd movie story line
Jan 23 2023,positive,this movie was a blast to watch i loved the fastpaced action and things happening at every second the story was a little above average it was no snore fest but i felt there was some missing context especially with the new superheroes we saw team up with black adam later in the movie despite those flaws this movie is very entertaining and its definitely worth the watch
Jan 23 2023,positive,black adam is a very entertaining funny movie with a hectic pace and great action sequences despite the fact that it lacks a good script and has a very forgettable villain dawne johnson is very charismatic as this antihero and the jsa although he is not fully exploited offers quite good moments especially for the character played by pierce brosnan  doctor fate in conclusion a fun light movie that is a good improvement on the dc universe
Jan 23 2023,positive,black adam is a very entertaining movie funny with a hectic pace and great action sequences despite the fact that it lacks a good script and has a very forgettable villain dawne johnson is very charismatic as this antihero and the jsa although he is not fully exploited offers quite good moments especially due to the character played by pierce brosnan dr fate in conclusion a fun light movie that is a good addition to the dc universe
Jan 22 2023,negative,im not sure what is wrong with the movie but something is missing either the script or the directors cuts that made it to the film are incomplete plus the casting about some of the actors wasnt the best choice eg the actor who played amon needs improvement
Jan 22 2023,negative,a mishmash that makes no sense with really bad dialogue
Jan 22 2023,positive,black adam is the best dc offering outside of suicide squad yet johnson does an excellent job as a hero that isnt squeamish about killing bad guys the early scenes of this movie are the wonderful and i was so excited for the direction it was going in the best scene has traditional ie nonlethal heros getting put in their place by a mother and woman of color for their complicity in the death and abuse of her country i was on my feet for her however rather than have this incredibly important narrative continue the story shoehorned demon creatures in so the final battle is against a cgi army instead of the real white oppressive colonizers that the movie starts with with some tweaks this could have been amazing
Jan 22 2023,positive,i dont care about other peoples negative opinions but i really liked it best superhero movie lately i liked black adam it was really good like i said i dont care about other peoples negative opinions
Jan 22 2023,positive,i really liked this movie the first few mins were slow but once it got started it flowed and had an interesting storyline id watch a second movie
Jan 22 2023,negative,highly disappointed huge dc fan but this was a let down dwayne johnson tried to make this movie about him
Jan 22 2023,positive,black adam was great  there was 1 part that i felt was too drawn out  aside from that it was very enjoyable and action packed
Jan 22 2023,negative,wtf was that just bad i would rather watch avatar with its unobtainium and cowboy and indians silliness again and i hated avatar
Jan 21 2023,positive,forgettable villain and terrible supporting actors but a very exciting film 1010 fight scenes and the rock amazing as black adam its worth watching
Jan 21 2023,positive,i recently watched black adam and while i did enjoy the movie overall i was not a fan of dwayne johnsons acting the story was compelling and the special effects were impressive but i found johnsons performance to be wooden and lacking in nuance however despite this i still found the movie to be an enjoyable watch with an interesting take on the black adam character and an engaging plot if you can look past the lead performance its worth checking out for the action and story
Jan 21 2023,neutral,black adam is a superhero film with a weak story an annoying kid and an underwhelming villain however the second half of the film is at least worth the price of admission the action scenes and special effects are impressive and dwayne the rock johnson delivers a strong performance as the titular character    one issue i had with the film is the fact that after being in a tomb for 5000 years black adam speaks english with an american accent its possible that this was simply a creative decision made by the filmmakers to make the character more relatable to a modern audience or it could be explained inuniverse as black adam having some form of telepathic or linguistic ability that allowed him to learn and understand the language    overall while the film has its flaws it is still an entertaining blockbuster with epic moments that take precedence over the story its not one of the top 20 comic book movies but it is still worth seeing for fans of dwayne johnson and for anyone looking for a fun and actionpacked movie experience just be aware that some of the characters may not make it to the end and their fates may deliver an emotional gut punch
Jan 21 2023,positive,awesome really good to watch with the kids
Jan 20 2023,positive,decent movie the rock really did look like a superhero its great when the actor looks the part shame he hasnt been used more
Jan 20 2023,positive,i liked it as an action movie
Jan 20 2023,positive,i thought it was great they did a great job of the special effects its a superhero movie we become to expect now days  i really didnt know what to expect coming into the movie and i watched it on hbo max and i have to say dwayne you blew me away just like all the other actors producers and directors i thought black adam the movie was very impressive   randyj 2023
Jan 19 2023,neutral,what this movie does great is great whats this movie does bad is bad the rock only does rock things and doesnt add anything else the script and the kid actor are what brings this movie down
Jan 19 2023,neutral,it was just okay the only good character from it was dr fate
Jan 19 2023,positive,pretty weak mid level nothing new
Jan 19 2023,positive,we should probably no longer rely on what the dceu promises as they release films from their socalled interconnected slate that are supposedly connected to others and they only build off of each other by little ever since the higher egos took over zack snyders justice league under joss whedons unveiled true colors continuously inconsistent without a solid gripfooting and only driven by fanservice rather than planning the overall storytelling structure only doing the competitive opposite that makes marvels already superior slate looking much better at irresistibly unfortunate comparisons there are alternate versions of what could have been if dc were not such bad desperate gamblers that would have been able to replicate marvels formulaic flow with retained signature darker tone individually each managed to be entertaining in their own valued ways it is the burdened shared universe concept that provokes criticism    so how different is black adam well it has been dwayne johnsons passionate project for years dating back to predceu as he provides muscular embodiment distant from his signature charisma that has defined most of his roles and as for the titular character he is usually told as power hungry and rivals shazam for the true champion placement since both were picked by the same wizard gaining a villainy status through his antagonistic clashes but one of dcs rules is that there can be more to a character by unseen depth till the time comes to finally learn and can be applied most likely by headcanon onto different iterations till a clarified version says otherwise what could be considered usual is that the film does live up to the extended part of the franchise by introducing multiple core characters in one sweep alongside the main focus as a final result typical imperfection is secondary behind striking awesomeness with pure entertainment that actually has not been theatrically felt since its narrativelyshared predecessor shazam    nearly 5000 years after he was bestowed with the almighty powers of the egyptian gods  and imprisoned just as quickly  black adam is freed from his earthly tomb ready to unleash his unique form of justice in the modern world as his powers signal a potential repeat that devastated a country during his rampage his appearance poses a question whether he is a true threat and why or what is the actual threat and can it be overcome    while it may not be as great at the achieved level managed by certain installments black adam contains impeccable entertainment value with a flawed backbone strengthened at enough power to promise a brighter future for dc to acceptably restart fresh it turns out as a tonally similar ride for director jaume collettserra as he treads and glamorously explores the story in emphasized glory across different elaborative transportive stages a trusted collaboration since he directed johnson in jungle cruise in awakening the power that flows through a storys narrative veins then viscerally enabled to the felt maximum while cleverly obscure twists and turns although he overused the slowmotion disruption that either lessens the forthcoming impact or amplifies the dramatic moment of summoned strength with the latter being more aesthetically appropriate and rationally used less collettserras reasoning may be wary to avoid the storm felt in the criticized batman v superman which been praised more favorably nonetheless the built action sequences are as exhilarating as they are characteristically fresh to a slight uplifting extent if not dampened nor repetitive after the core dimensional displays upon adapted as another formed version aside from the familiar mediums    what lingers in the mind is the electrifying music that suitably powers the film by creating thematic definition  therefore also continuing signified auteurism till modified otherwise composer lorne balfe scored at peaked effective volume when he generated a recurring theme that energetically supports the action and the eponymous momentum as a reminder for the sake of distancing from the genres rolegiven genericity it is his music that definitively bolstered the film to the achieved height that enthralls and actually nondigetically uplifts which does not get realized often    the performances reinforce the impacts by decent delivery over a script that vocally finds faithful connections and allows fun humor or regarding its thinly written screenplay their statures get demeaned by coerced participation controlling the titanic monsters in godzilla king of the monsters is an example to think about due to thick skulls and repetitiveness supported by reasonable notions but only at an element not on different terrains that were circumstantially outsmarted in the animated films therefore continuing the liveaction realms flawed embrace under misguided proudful stroke that only nears proficiency or not executed to match well anyway typical showcases of good performances  minus marwen kenzari once again antagonistically embracing underwhelmingly  with pierce brosnan rising above as doctor fate to somewhat matching the characters equivalence to marvels doctor strange as both are positionally similar between role and performative embodiment hovering above further on the recognized twoperson podium is johnson finally and formally fulfilling his dream of bringing black adam to life with a mesmerizing performance how much he is connected to the character with provided heft beneath the usual villainous side only clarifying the antihero status thus distancing from his usual charismatic form he does edges closer to that frequent perception through iconic imagery surrounding the characters profile    after black adam proposed a fresh hopeful restart as an exciting chapter to the interconnected slate dc reconstructs again putting a meaningless end to its credits scene that was the cherry on top only to fall off it will be a while before seeing johnsons black adam again if ever but his revived reign will remain entertaining because theres power surrounding its significance with potential continuous rise generally imperfect to describe its flaws but awesome as dcs latest fare skyrocketed to valued entertainment purity with exhilaration while there are couple remaining chapters in the current dceu before the rebirth a nice takeaway to describe the film is that it thunderstrikes on a good note rejuvenating possible faith towards the brand with assumingly solid inspiration to get things right dwayne johnsons nonfading project finally got justified without dimming in disappointment at the end as it promises worthwhile enjoyment b
Jan 19 2023,positive,best dcs hero movie ever
Jan 18 2023,negative,typical poor comic movie  weak story some good fighting scenes the only cool thing was the super man cameo at the end and not find out they are changing it up
Jan 18 2023,positive,its good the rock did an excellent job and characters were great
Jan 18 2023,neutral,its like terminator 2 followed by a blur of cg action i cant remember the plot but i think there were morals in it hawkman was cool would rather see a movie based on hawkgirl from the animated justice league
Jan 18 2023,negative,horrible terrible stupid
Jan 17 2023,positive,nothing new to see hear superhero movies have lost their appeal this was the first movie i have seen in a theatre in a long time i could have waited until it hit streaming it really wasnt a good story and dwayne johnson was playing the same person he plays in all his movies
Jan 17 2023,negative,hackneyed script one note performance from the dwayne johnson and a dated looking  unimpressive cgi villain with no real origin or back story its a pretty standard offering from wb  and their attempt a mimicking marvels shared universe hopefully the last gasp before james gunn reboots very disappointed only gets the half star as hawkman and dr fate were well done
Jan 17 2023,positive,packed full of action very enjoyable just didnt give me that buzz of wanting more
Jan 17 2023,positive,i enjoyed this adaptation for the most part but it would be much better if they stick more to the comics
Jan 17 2023,negative,its not good not sure how this script passed
Jan 17 2023,positive,easily just as great as the superman movies
Jan 17 2023,neutral,didnt hate it but didnt love it either     it feels like ive seen this movie before nothing original in this one i feel like ive seen that origin story many times      youll have fun watching this dont get me wrong but its very hohum and easily forgettable the villain looks badass but is very weak compared to others in comic book movies that kill scene was awesome the best part of the movie imo    even the soundtrack was uninspired paint it black  power seriously    not much more to say on this one include it in a movie marathon if you need films to fill the day its definitely not a must watch but worth watching if youve never seen it before     this gets a lennyreviewz score of 510
Jan 16 2023,negative,2022 provided two towering archetypes of putrefyingly stale genre recycling  this movie and bullet train i would have to be handcuffed to a chair with eyelids sewn open to make me watch either a second time
Jan 16 2023,positive,i liked that the justice society of america was in the film as they havent been on the big screen ever from what i can remember though the fighting was just ok and the story wasnt the best the best part about it was the jokes and its a story about fighting the most interesting part to me was the ending because it makes you think about whats going to happen next
Jan 16 2023,positive,its a pity dc wont continue down the path laid out in this movie an excellente superhero action movie which should have opened the path to a new dcverse
Jan 16 2023,positive,an average superhero movie in almost every respect with stock characters a predictable plot and bloated overlong action scenes  theres nothing about it thats especially bad but its also not particularly imaginative or memorable
Jan 16 2023,positive,a fun and enjoyable popcorn movie with a decent plot twist good acting and just an all around good vibe  not winning any oscars but these kinds of movies never do go in expecting a comic book movie and you cant be disappointed when you get one
Jan 16 2023,positive,much to love sad part 2 got canned along with wonder woman 3
Jan 16 2023,positive,generic superhero flick  was expecting more but not as bad as critics say  pierce brosnan did a nice job
Jan 16 2023,positive,definitely a good time dark and grimey world of the dc universe is how it should be dont expect an incredible movie just go into it with an open mind and enjoy it  have fun and the rock is great as well as the supporting cast
Jan 15 2023,positive,actionpacked  the rock
Jan 15 2023,positive,solid action and crowd pleasing moments my 10 year old thought it was amazing i wish some of the supporting characters had been a little better constructed but all in all a lot of fun for a family movie night
Jan 15 2023,positive,currently rated 88 by audience but panned by a lot by youtube critics  felt like it was a pretty reasonable action  superhero movie especially seeing as 2022 was generally speaking an uninspiring year for films and marvel phase 4 has been so bad    what dragged down the rating  1 the setting considering we spend virtually the whole film here the settling needed have a little more put into it to keep in interesting i get why they did the setting the way they did but they could have put more in to stop it feeling dull at times and spoiling your enjoyment of the film  2 the eurogang thing not handled well felt cringe almost every time it came up  3 the female superhero the fact i cant even remember her name reflects that not enough was done with her and she felt flat generic and irrelevant why put a superhero character in a film and have them feel pointless kept waiting for a moment where her purpose for being in the film would come and add to the story but it never came which was some what distracting   but those are minor gripes about a pretty reasonable film good enough id consider watching it again which i think is the sign of a decent movie  r
Jan 15 2023,neutral,the plot was okay but i felt they added too much into the movie that they didnt need
Jan 15 2023,neutral,albeit having a painfully generic script with a ton of cliché dialogue as well as characters who arent fleshed out that well and plot points that make absolutely no sense at all black adam was still a pretty fun time for me personally where it faltered in compelling storytelling it made up for by not being boring i would honestly rather watch this again than doctor strange in the multiverse of madness
Jan 14 2023,positive,not sure how cohesive this film is to the comic but was enjoyable the whole film very violent compared to other dc movies and the cgi was quite noticeable still enjoyable
Jan 14 2023,negative,i wanted to like this movie so badly because i like dwayne johnson but the movie was just too boring to get through i tried multiple times  overall the movie was uninspiring boring and unintentionally silly
Jan 14 2023,positive,your expectations for a film will always affect your judgement after seeing it with that said i went into black adam not expecting much thought i would be bored most of the time but it was actually a nice thrill ride i loved hawkman and dr fate was pretty funny at some points as well
Jan 14 2023,positive,loved it its a shame they wont be making another
Jan 14 2023,positive,it was ok i heard all of the reviews before seeing it so i had low expectations regular people fighting the undead army with sticks was a little much overall i felt that it was worth my time and id watch again could have been much better 
Jan 14 2023,negative,this movie was the definition of boring i literally fell asleep it was so boring it just kept dragging on and on i felt as if it could have ended an hour before it really did there was some funny and action packed scenes but other then that i do not recommend
Jan 14 2023,positive,just watched on hbomax i liked the movie a lot it had great action and i liked the back story of black adam  dr fate and falcon were great too  i am sad that this movie didnt make enough money to keep the dceu going
Jan 14 2023,positive,was super hyped for this movie only to be let down a little as the story was plain and boring and some cgi parts looked fake but the action scenes made up for some of it
Jan 14 2023,positive,to be honest i didnt know much about dc movies but i loved mcu works so i watched it with the expectation that i could feel that kind of thing  at the beginning it looks like lord of the rings and progresses with dark development so it started with a series of scary scenes that make you think its horror  however i apologize for the very bad expression in the middle battle scene but i think it was a production character and technique that i have seen somewhere before   i dont know what the future of dc movies will be like but i definitely wanted to experience the excitement of the mcu in dc it was such a sad movie
Jan 14 2023,positive,being a dc movie i was preparing for 2 and a half hours of full suck but was instead shocked not a big rock fan and he was pretty much what he always is in moviesbut the justice society made the movie great the action scenes were phenomenal
Jan 14 2023,positive,one of the best dc movies to date shame gunn is screwing things up
Jan 13 2023,positive,best movie of all time
Jan 13 2023,positive,it was fun actionpacked and one of the best films to come from the dc universe in a while
Jan 13 2023,positive,good story great action sequences and special effects
Jan 13 2023,positive,nowhere near as bad as some people have made it out to be  i can think of a lot worse comic book adaptations eg lxg green lantern  its a pity there wont be a follow up vs superman
Jan 13 2023,positive,i love this movie it was entertaining and fun to watch it is far better then shazam for me i also loved the fact that it was dwayne johnson as the star and the story line was well put together 
Jan 12 2023,negative,another superhero movie meh  i didnt think dwayne johnsons acting could go in reverse i mean i knew it would never get better as he plays the same person in every movie but boy oh boy did he lay an egg on this one  the story was awful acting was subpar and it just wasnt good
Jan 12 2023,negative,this 88 percent audience score says a lot about the state of cinema you must be mentally insane if you think this is a good movie
Jan 12 2023,neutral,this movie isnt bad action wise but the plot makes zero sense if youre a dc fan they try to make black adam a heros by the end and i have no clue why trigon is in the movie at all and how they were able to beat him
Jan 12 2023,positive,it took me awhile to actually watch this while this was not a blockbuster must see movie that will go down in history its still a good movie there was the right amount of humor to action and it was a type of humor that i can relate to the story was good and i think the rock did an awesome job portraying black adam its good to see the dcu get one right the first time
Jan 12 2023,positive,its amazing i dont care what others say
Jan 12 2023,negative,this is an objectively bad movie  audiences have become so dumb they can no longer tell the difference between commercials and classic storytelling
Jan 12 2023,negative,very poor movie for this hero
Jan 11 2023,positive,great movie once again critics are wrong and the audience proves it
Jan 11 2023,positive,great movie love it 
Jan 11 2023,negative,this movie was a mistake from beginning to end horribly done
Jan 11 2023,positive,this movie is bad azz i dont know what the movie critics are complaining about 
Jan 10 2023,positive,not the best superhero movie ever but for dc its fine dr fate is now my favorite dc hero
Jan 10 2023,positive,great movie lots of action filled fun moments critics are wrong as usual
Jan 10 2023,positive,it was a straight smash and bash movie with a simple plot 
Jan 10 2023,positive,fun mindless hero movie quite like the darkness to this one more homelander than superclown the windy girl and atom boy did not really add much to the story but otherwise it was a solid enjoyable movie that doesnt take itself too seriously akin the the screaming goats from guardians of the galaxy  the female lead drops a few truth bombs about how the other heroes read westerners treat the middle east nice and refreshing
Jan 10 2023,negative,i dont believe i have ever seen such a horrible movie only good thing were the special effects dialogue was dumb plot was irritatingly simple and a copy of oh so many other movies of this genre 
Jan 10 2023,neutral,even the rock couldnt save the terrible script of this movie too many tired superhero clichés and wannabe mcu characters make this a runofthemill action movie at best 
Jan 9 2023,positive,not sure why all the hate on black adam wasnt the best super hero movie ever but was far better than some out there i mean batman vs superman people have to stop comparing it to a marvel film and stop agreeing with others just to sound cool turn your brain off for a couple hours and just enjoy
Jan 9 2023,positive,i think that this movie is cool to watch when you have nothing else to do pretty fun movie and worth watching
Jan 9 2023,positive,was just perfect dunno why dc fired dwayne and henry man couldve led to something amazing
Jan 9 2023,positive,it was alright for dc standards it was amazing although definitely couldnt hold a candle to the dark knight trilogy but holy crap why did the demon king villain look so badly animated did they switch animation studios or something
Jan 9 2023,negative,mostly of the superheroes looked like a sad parody of mcu heroes they even took years and years to script this movie and ended with some nonsense thing worst part is that the movie is not just bad is even boring
Jan 9 2023,negative,i love the rock and i think he was alright but the rest was just bleh boring dialogue terrible effects and some awful acting by most of the actors
Jan 9 2023,positive,this was a welcomed addition and twist to the dc universe i wish i would have been able to see this in theaters definitely brought the new life dc was needing to compete with marvel
Jan 8 2023,negative,i am a huge fan of the rock but man this is embarrassing one of the worst movies ive ever seen
Jan 8 2023,positive,i found this movie to be entertaining dwayne johnson portrays the infamous black adam very well the justice society seemed to almost have more screen time than the actual main character the villain sabac was hardly in the film overall i think this movie is overhated and deserves around 3 12  4 stars if you havent watched this movie yet id definitely recommend giving it a try
Jan 8 2023,positive,great movie tbh its like adam but hes black
Jan 8 2023,positive,it is incredibly derivative down to costume design super powers weaknesses themes its very formulaic much like marvel has become the companys knowknew how to sell a hero movie because of that the post colonial theme which is always a strong element in stories is undercut but the bureaucracy of the hollywood movie machine so to say the surface message is fantastic but the message was crafted by a whole bunch of people who know just what to say lionel trilling kicked off postmodernism with the belief that true ideas cannot survive in bureaucratic institutions without some loss of their complexity and nuance the really great ideas become the simpler and more dangerous form of ideologies like lets say post colonialism thus we end up with recycled cliches from tolkien to superman and a message so obviously spelled out for the audience that it lacks nuance and depth but its enjoyable as movie and the characters are fun too 
Jan 8 2023,negative,another movie starring the rock playing the rock i had such high hopes for this film and while the scenes with the justice society were well done and stunning the overall storyline and pace were disappointing
Jan 8 2023,positive,it is a nice and fun movie it shows that the rock is the best fit acteur for black adam
Jan 8 2023,negative,top five worst movies ive seen for sure all of the characters are poorly developed which makes it hard to stay interested in anything happening the only good part is the one plot twist which trailers already allude toruin 100 an actionpacked movie with little to no plot very few laughable moments very unoriginal the only reason this is worth more than one star is because the cgi is done well but thats the least you expect from a dc movie
Jan 8 2023,negative,basically a 90s movie in the worst way possible yes it has obvious green screens weird acting bland characters and a boring plot which cant live up to the action it promises and we just barley receive
Jan 8 2023,positive,well black adam has finally hit theaters and at the very least the rock delivered on his promise to change the hierarchy of power in the dceu but thats about it dwayne johnson is really good as black adam despite being nowhere near the right ethnicity to play the character you can tell he at least cares about the character and enjoys playing him aldis hodge is an alright hawkman but all his scenes were just adam clowning on him and he didnt get a chance to actually shine pierce brosnan is actually pretty perfect as my guy dr fate he is my injustice main and i saw that victory screen easter egg during one of his fight scenes i ended up liking noah centineos atom smasher more than i thought i would he was delightfully stupid and adorable i actually ended up liking quintessa swindells cyclone so much that after the movie i went and got her action figure sarah shahi mo amer and bodhi sabongui are great civilian characters to follow and i liked their impact on the story marwan kenzari did a good job playing a completely unnecessary character i really think this film could have stood on its own as a jsa vs black adam film the sabbac parts were the least interesting parts of the movie and ultimately the villain was wasted in what could have been a good future movie i loved that they got djimon hounsou back for his very brief cameos as the wizard from shazam viola davis is always a welcome sight especially as amanda waller and i see you rock sneaking in uli latukefu for a brief role latukefu plays the college age version of dwayne on the young rock show i feel like they were building up to a twist in the flashback scenes but i dont see how it could possibly be seen as a twist if you saw even a single trailer the visuals are pretty great at every stage and the action sequences are some of the best this year the writing however is just so goddamn cringey at times and as a whole this movie just reminded me of the comic book films we would get back in the early 2000s before the mcu took off things that would have been fine then but now that weve evolved passed it they no longer work im giving black adam a very solid 710 tyler
Jan 8 2023,positive,best movie badass superheroneed more guys like him making beast movies ps iron man killed mercenaries in his first iron man movie and it was a hit
Jan 8 2023,negative,the rock sure did hype this up and let me tell you this movie was a really good superhero film for something that came out in 2010 this movie is late to the party and arrived to a franchise people started to lose faith in years ago it was fine and thats really all there is to it the villain was absolutely awful and forgettable and the only redeeming factor is the post credit scene
Jan 8 2023,positive,forget the critic reviews go off the real people that matterus loved every minute of this film cant wait for black adam 2
Jan 7 2023,positive,good but not great the best part of the movie was the post credits scene
Jan 7 2023,negative,about as bad a film as you can get for the budget  script  acting  cgi  its sooooo bad
Jan 7 2023,positive,great movie not as bad as the professional critics say pierce brosnan was fantastic as dr fate lots of action very entertaining 
Jan 7 2023,negative,perhaps it would have been better with a different storyline a more experienced director and a rock who was willing to completely embrace the opportunity to play adam as a monster i actually believe that the casting is excellent for the majority of the roles and you can almost see the shadow of what mr johnson may have given had the direction been more successful i have to presume that this was put together by committee therefore i dont want to assign sole responsibility for the teams shortcomings but the sum of its pieces never equals the whole
Jan 7 2023,positive,i loved this movie and was really hoping for a ba and sm team up or at least a fight  i hope they actually still make it  i really enjoy both rock and cavills works critics have no idea what fans like most people cant remember movies details anyway only the profesional critics can say something is too predictable they seem to forget nothing is new under the sun  i love spectacles and thats what this is
Jan 7 2023,positive,amazing i hope we can have black adam 2 with that super man oh man sounds like they have a pretty cool history effects and the best actor hope dc gives black adam more movies
Jan 7 2023,negative,should have been called vomitcoloured adam  the rock  or whatever his name is is a dreadful actor
Jan 7 2023,positive,i really enjoyed this dc outing the special effects were fantastic and the rock was the perfect actor to play this character i had never even heard of black adam before this film but i hope he has a future with dc films going forward
Jan 7 2023,positive,amazing music and fantastic fight scenes not sure why it gets so much hate
Jan 7 2023,neutral,so basically drstrange flacon and antman from wishcom came to try and defeat a man as strong as superman it would have been way more interestinğif superman came in from the start dc is becoming more and more boring with new supes every movie
Jan 6 2023,positive,excellent movie with amazing fx
Jan 6 2023,negative,honestly i wanted to give this a thorough review i fell asleep twice no joke but anyways i watched it thru it was kinda like a b movie quite honestly the side actors were not energetic in their reactions the rock played the rock no surprise it was honestly a let down the end credit scene is the best even then it was not good just all around a bad film 
Jan 6 2023,positive,good movie   my name is dr michael jordan i have done mbbs and live in the usa i have 3 years experience as a gp i am working with various companies like custom health centers  
Jan 6 2023,negative,watched it forgot it
Jan 6 2023,positive,this movie felt like a step in the right direction for dc the fights were awesome and you could actually feel that the rock had love for the characters the end credits scene gave me hope too bad warner took all of that from us thanks dtrj for giving us one last great dceu movie i guess its time to move on from dc
Jan 6 2023,positive,its a boilerplate superhero movie nothing special about it i think kids in these kinds of movies are getting more annoying as i get older the rock is just terrible in this and is clearly not a good actor dr fate and hawkman are the only redeeming qualities of this film
Jan 6 2023,positive,the movie had fantastic visuals  a storyline that was easy to follow the rock played his part opposite of his comedic work which was refreshing the cast was likable  portrayed their characters well it was very enjoyable  is better watched in theaters to enjoy the spectacle
Jan 5 2023,negative,this movie is the victim of some of the worst child acting and nonsensical politically apolitical subtexts in the history of filmmaking when the wheels come off oh boy its like falling out of a rollercoaster 
Jan 5 2023,positive,black adam while clumsy at points was a completely enjoyable film it hinted at a much larger dc universe that we are unfortunately never going to see due to poor decisions made by wbd executives and a new head of dc films having so little talent that he can only create with a blank slate
Jan 5 2023,positive,special effects check action check lackluster dc script and storytelling check
Jan 5 2023,positive,a pure mixture of action  visual treats the rocks literally give goosebumps background score is amazing as well really enjoyed it
Jan 5 2023,positive,loved this from dc  one of their best
Jan 5 2023,neutral,theres a kernel of a decent story line hidden behind bad direction writing dialogue and plot  this movie probably died by committee
Jan 5 2023,negative,poorly made film the story wasnt good and it was all over the place the entire movie this could have been so much more 
Jan 5 2023,negative,i thought it was going to be more action ed packed and dark it was super cheesy and the city where it all took place looked super fake super disappointing sticking to marvel from here on out im done with dc
Jan 5 2023,positive,it was packed full of story and action and lil funnies really upset that warner is messaging up the universe going forward this could have re kickstarted the whole thing loved it
Jan 5 2023,positive,i loved this film it was good old fashioned super hero fun without being preachy but alas james gunn and his ilk have destroyed the snyderverse so the future team up with superman  henry cavill  has been stolen from us long live black adam dwane johnson
Jan 5 2023,positive,fun movie good action scenes still too much cgi a staple for dc movies sadly the rock did a good job on this
Jan 4 2023,positive,im not up on the entire dc comics universe and especially the shazam portion im not sure where black adam fits in as to the movie it is a typical action film this one did not have all the bells and whistles when it comes to action that many of the action films do in their universes dc marvel etc  it isnt the worst universe film out there but definitely isnt the best if you like the rock youll probably enjoy him in the role
Jan 4 2023,positive,the movie was great and if you like action packed adventure movies like me i would definitely recommend black adam
Jan 4 2023,positive,i really liked and enjoyed this moviefun dc comic stuff in there withdr fate and hawkmanblack adam as a movie in generalhas a lot of problems pacing no character just action action actionwhich is fun but the movie needed more storybut a fun time at the movies
Jan 4 2023,negative,mediocre movie nothing special about it at all the action scenes were ruined with the slo mo affect bad acting from the rock once again dont recommend this at all
Jan 4 2023,negative,minimal plot hokey special effects poor interpretations of pretty much every character they put on screen it is just the rock making faces and a bunch of cgi i dont even think they needed stunt men for this movie because any scene where anyone is moving its all cgi
Jan 4 2023,negative,was amazed nobody on set said anything like wait really thats gonna be in the movie at least once every scene it was fun to watch though if you like laughing at terrible movies with friends
Jan 4 2023,positive,black adam 2022 was a decent movie that had a lot of potential the story follows the titular character black adam as he is released from prison and sets out to take revenge on those who wronged him the movie had a great cast with dwayne johnson in the lead role as black adam johnson was able to bring a lot of charisma and energy to the role making it a joy to watch    the action sequences were well choreographed and exciting with some great special effects the fight scenes were intense and thrilling and the cgi was topnotch the movie also had some great set pieces with some impressive locations and sets    the story was interesting and engaging with some great twists and turns the plot was wellpaced and kept the audience engaged throughout the movie also had some great moments of humor which helped to lighten the mood    overall black adam 2022 was a decent movie that had a lot of potential the action sequences were exciting and the story was engaging the cast was great and the special effects were topnotch the movie had some great moments of humor and the plot was wellpaced if youre looking for an entertaining action movie then black adam 2022 is worth checking out
Jan 4 2023,negative,i really wanted to like this movie because i love the rock but the acting wtf script and overthetopness of it left me turning it off after 15min
Jan 4 2023,negative,the cgi will held up like the matrix 2 did the storyline has a bunch of holes in it that even the first past didnt make any sense and why couldnt dwayne keep an accent thru out the movie like he forgot his kahndaq language shazam apparently over 5000 years old but it sounds american and honestly most of the movie couldve been avoided if the justice societys knew what conflict they were getting themselves into before they start attacking black adam
Jan 3 2023,negative,i honestly think everyone past present and future that chooses to do anything with dc should be fired before theyre hired lol i dont know why you people cant make a decent movie go hire the crew from marvel for crying out loud i couldnt make it through 45 minutes of this movie and that included did some fast forwarding starting with the opening monologue which was horrible the rock is many things but an actor is not one of them nor was anyone else in the beginning of the movie wrong facial expressions to juvenile body movements and some of the worst writing ive ever heard in my life if theyre writing this stuff for kids then i can understand but if thats true then maybe you should turn down the violence i honestly cant believe this thing made 391 million and was rated an 88 by civilians i didnt finish it because i couldnt stomach it so i had to just delete it
Jan 3 2023,negative,rip off avangers much  rip off dr strange ant man and and and and a bad one  i love the rock but this is a bad rip off he stills rocks the movie tho
Jan 3 2023,neutral,the first 20 minutes are not good and the last act is especially not good however the middle part is kinda fun i guess the justice society is definitely the best part of the movie but the story is weak the villian even weaker and one of the corniest dialog i have ever seen
Jan 3 2023,positive,excellent movie those critics have no idea about entertainment
Jan 3 2023,negative,kind of weird and confusing seemed like the beginning of something good but ended up disjointed and odd
Jan 3 2023,positive,a film of the genre of heroes that follows the pattern of other productions  regrettable people expect more than a hero movie has to offer if you compare the movie with others of the genre the difference is that i realize that it is more violent but that is not necessarily bad but it was a great experience to watch this movie
Jan 3 2023,positive,this was average as super hero movies go the rock has the physical presence but his acting in a serious role is a stretch the special effects were believable
Jan 3 2023,positive,we need black adam vs superman 
Jan 3 2023,positive,this is an incredibly fun movie wonderful costumes and characters love every minute of except knowing there wouldnt be more movies spun off for these characters
Jan 3 2023,negative,i finally got around to seeing black adam i went in with low expectations and still ended up disappointed i started it last night fell asleep after a half hour and had to watch it in three installments today due to boredom i am giving it two stars because the family in the film was fairly well acted and visuals had their moments the rock demonstrated little acting range much of the casts acting was flat and the story was poorly written i often like and sometimes love superhero movies this just didnt do it for me
Jan 3 2023,positive,as a comic book movie this is easily a 75 out of 10  great action  special effects  movie critics are horrible at picking fun enjoyable movies  if youre looking for entertainment go see this flick
Jan 2 2023,positive,i absolutely loved this movie great acting and awesome cgi
Jan 2 2023,positive,the best dc story yet
Jan 2 2023,negative,i want to see it againnope
Jan 2 2023,positive,excellent effects portraying super powers perfect level of brutality the character needs serious tone with just the right amount of humour and a solid storyline its insane dc are cancelling everything now of all times
Jan 2 2023,positive,dwayne johnson is always entertaining  however  the whole justice society storyline and characters were terrible could have spent more time developing the main characters so the audience is more invested
Jan 2 2023,positive,i think this movie is better than it gets credit for its excellently violent and the rock is excellent as black adam im glad he was finally able to get this movie made after trying for so many years and im upset that this version of black adam wont be continuing into james gunns new dc universe nor will we see the teased interaction with superman or even shazam unless theres a surprise cameo in shazam 2 or something would have loved to see the r rated version though
Jan 2 2023,negative,terrible terrible terrible flat acting from the cast it could have been so much better with a deeper storyline that was better developed and not so blatantly predictable the special effect was the only caveat that kept me watching
Jan 2 2023,positive,black adam is a fairly accurate depiction of the comics character yes there are changes but nothing major the film like many action films sometimes mistakes character moments for development thats the only thing keeping me from handing out 5 stars that and maybe it should have taken a page from ms marvel and given us more than just 3 ordinary people for the audience and for adam to connect with and care about
Jan 2 2023,negative,nothing special the action seemed to never end which might delight some but i wanted a break from it early on and that break never came little to no character growth its been roughly a week since i saw this and i cant remember anyones motivation for doing anything
Jan 2 2023,negative,poor movie script characters with little to zero emotional deepness messy plot super uninteresting a failureclass wannabe justice league extremely dissapointing i dont reccomend wasting your time watching this movie
Jan 1 2023,negative,embarrassing to admit i watched it i want my time wasted back such a shame
Jan 1 2023,negative,from the very beginning the amount of scenes that feel ripped off from other movies predominantly marvel was overwhelming was it made well absolutely if those scenes were so blatantly obvious not an original idea this movie could have been great
Jan 1 2023,positive,such a great story and well put together movie that you dont even have to be a comic fan to enjoy  by far one of the best dc movies out there  the movie critics need to find new jobs and stop being sheep
Jan 1 2023,positive,i thought it was a great film it was a great story that was not along the usual super hero line which gave the character more depth brosnan was phenomenal as dr fate and dj played the antihero well i watched it 4 times in 3 days a lot of fun with top notch effects diverse characters and plenty of action
Jan 1 2023,negative,as much as i love dwayne johnson this movie is pretty lame
Jan 1 2023,negative,i enjoyed it but i wont see it again
Dec 31 2022,positive,the story was dumb dumb dumb  it had some nice action sequences but the last 20 minutes felt very shoe horned
Dec 31 2022,neutral,the visuals and action sequences were cool outside of that i didnt care much about the characters story and stakes would only recommend it to people who really like superhero movies
Dec 31 2022,positive,fun action great visuals and entertaining performances from dwayne johnson  pierce brosnan make black adam an easy film to enjoy but it is an uneven movie with deficiencies regarding story and flow
Dec 31 2022,positive,loved it not a super hero movie much different good story and the rock is great
Dec 31 2022,positive,other than mediocre there wasnt much to say about black adam the character development was especially lacking especially for black adam himself who goes from being an antihero to an antihero with slightly more morals i wish they had focused more on him but unfortunately the movie did not the characters were so cut and dry i really wished they explored more of hawkmans and dr fates friendship but there wasnt all that much and it seemed forced toward the end the setting was also a sore spot kahndaq is supposed to be a large and ancient city but the movie seems to be set within the same 1 or 2 blocks of the city almost everything takes place in the same part of the city it makes it feel more like a movie set than an actual city which leaves a lot to be desired morality and justice are mentioned thematically but only on the surface it tries to get deep and thoughtprovoking but comes off as it is what it is     the plot itself wasnt anything spectacular and was very easy to follow which is expected in a superhero movie the one bright spot of the movie was the action and cgi i thought the cgi was good and there was a lot of action that kept you entertained its cool to see an incredibly overpowered superhero just beating on everyone its fun enough of a movie to watch but thats all it is
Dec 31 2022,positive,it was a unique tone and pace i liked that this shook up the formulaic structure of a superhero movie even though i wasnt as sure how to feel about it as it was happening charismatic leads for sure exciting action definitely will watch again harder to enjoy when dc is such a mess and i know there wont be a sequel in the near future if ever
Dec 31 2022,positive,it was surprisingly good i normally do not like dwayne johnsons films this was good  i am normally bored 60 minutes into a dc film even for some of my favorite superheroes  i was not bored watching this film at all  go in with low expectations and come out a winner
Dec 31 2022,negative,a truely fantastic movie to aid a great afternoon nap
Dec 31 2022,positive,this turned out to be a dope movie sure some things are kind of off but over all i was locked on the movie  as silly as it may sound it was like watching a painting in motion
Dec 31 2022,positive,this movie was badass dont listen to the critics  entertaining to say the least couldnt stop watching it
Dec 31 2022,positive,a movie inundated with action and visuals the story takes time to process and doesnt feel like it being part of the same universe as shazam a good popcorn movie for the action movie fanatic
Dec 30 2022,negative,nothing good to say about this no plot no characters to get attached to this is like a tindee relationship  no substance to it just get to the excitement yet it just couldnt preform and will leave you feeling empty very unsatisfied a little dirty used and foolish for wasting your time
Dec 30 2022,positive,i enjoyed this movieagain the pro critics look absolutely lost
Dec 30 2022,neutral,why is dc so bad at this if it had been dr strange antman storm and the falcon it would have at least been entertaining to watch the acting was suspect and the directing was horrible some scenes ran way too long which caused the movie to drag on longer than necessary i do not blame the rock for the failure of this movie as he was the only interesting character
Dec 30 2022,positive,a movie that thanks to the rock as the star has fantastic action and a decent story this is just a fantastic superhero bmovie
Dec 30 2022,negative,movie mustve been edited by a child on sugar rush no shot holds for more than 3 seconds lacks any charm and was totally forgettable
Dec 30 2022,positive,lived up to the hype for me good acting great action sequences the slowmo scene was very well done loved it
Dec 30 2022,positive,boring movie terrible performance by dwayne johnson sarah shahi made it possible to watch the movie
Dec 30 2022,positive,too much slow mo on the green chick besides that excellent movie
Dec 30 2022,positive,nice effects nice humor thats it
Dec 30 2022,negative,the plot is very stale and predictable  with such a huge following and no lack of material for writers to study character development should have been very easy to excel at instead of miserably failing to take the story nowhere
Dec 29 2022,positive,how in the world did this movie fail to break even thats just unreali loved it and it will forever remain dear in my heart
Dec 29 2022,negative,stupid super hero movies have gotten very predicable where has the creativity gone in hollywood
Dec 29 2022,neutral,there was potential but didnt really use it
Dec 29 2022,negative,flat stale predictable without any flare  missing any magic
Dec 29 2022,positive,in my first viewing all i could think of was huh for like the first hour but i enjoyed the rest of the movie in my second viewing i liked the movie a little more but i just cant used to the acting of the boy sorry but it was bad and ruined the movie a bit
Dec 29 2022,negative,i mean this movie could have been good the premise wasnt bad i like the rock and sarah shahi despite that god awful sexy series she did last year but this movie just wasnt it whats the point of the jla if youre going to race swap everyone and go with the boring version of carter hall i like aldis hodge but dude is no thanagarian dont even get me started on what they did to cyclone dear hollywood stop replacing gingers with pocs good lord its become a drinking game now pierce brosnan as dr fate was serviceable and frankly he should have been the focus of the movie and not the scrappy new team members basically this film deserved to fail not that the new heads of dc will learn anything from it
Dec 29 2022,positive,its was a tippycal heroe movie but with a new versios of whos good or bad i like it
Dec 29 2022,negative,something about this movie was just off  not consistent with the previous shazam movie and the origin backstory
Dec 29 2022,positive,so good full of action and emotions loved the hints of comedy as well might not be for younger kids but i let mine watch it anyways and they loved it just as they do all super hero movies plus who doesnt love the rock
Dec 29 2022,negative,another example of a mess of random heroes compressed in 2 hours of events without a deep explanation of the characters background typical of a dc movie im so tired  boooooring
Dec 29 2022,negative,this movie is a mess im writing this review half way through the movie wondering if i am going to finish it the writing is bad the cgi effects are bad and the acting is even worse this movie couldve had so much potential
Dec 29 2022,negative,mindnumbingly idiotic hollywood mcmovie bombast hacky dialogue amateurish acting cartoonish cgi the film and the title character are forgotten immediately upon exiting the theater
Dec 29 2022,positive,not bad i thought it was going to be shocking but i was pleasantly surprised
Dec 29 2022,negative,a truely disappointing film that i wish i could get the 2 plus hours it ran back but i know thats impossible  ive been a fan of the rock and his films up until this one i found it ridiculous and poorly made for a dc character based action adventure film i hope this film is never revisited and this one is just forgotten for the rock
Dec 29 2022,positive,good film but didnt add anything to the already dying dceu everything was about the postcredit scene which led nowhere dwayne johnson was good but not great with cringey dialogue some bad acting bad cgi and a shitty villain the hierarchy of power in the dc universe is about to change the dceu didnt change in any ways
Dec 29 2022,positive,not bad too bad its already a dead end story cuz of james  pew pew gun
Dec 29 2022,negative,why did they even make this the dc franchise is arguably the worst in cinematic history this stinker is no exception
Dec 29 2022,positive,updating comment since watching shazam 2 this movie is a masterpiece compared to that
Dec 29 2022,negative,have loved most of the rocks movies but this one misses the mark for me really wanted it to be good
Dec 28 2022,positive,very fun movie cool visuals engaging plot and characters definitely recommend for a fun time
Dec 28 2022,neutral,its not amazing but it is good although it doesnt know what its supposed to be the plot seems to change a few times and the worst part of the movie is probably the 3rd act but through all that its still a pretty decent and fun movie
Dec 28 2022,negative,lil dwayne and the rushed story line was way to obvious dc movies are so predictable it hurts and the religious push took away from the character development
Dec 28 2022,positive,first time post maker poster postinicianto anyway this movie is made for comic book fans the frame shot scenes if taken like a comic book frame are magnificent most people who dont read comics miss the absolute art that went into framing this movie as a continuous comic book frame story so well done impressed at a time when this level of attention to detail and requisite criteria are often overlooked for sensationalism especially for fans of ipintellectual property not being condescending some people didnt know disney took ip and changed a lot to make their content i appreciate sticking to a style of storytelling comicbook to let the fans enjoy the production the amount of punctuation i felt necessary today to not offend offends me lol
Dec 28 2022,negative,what a mess  liked the characters in general the acting but typical dc mess what in the world is this story  earth  what fictional country in what land that has demons injected into the history as if earth doesnt already have plausible and documented histories  its as if another world somewhere sometime but oh its also earth  its just a story mess as if written by people who have absolutely no education and awareness of history basics  but thats how hollywood is today right  discard all things past doomed to repeat  all just chaos in writing and things spewed out of gob holes on their faces  complete ignorance  complete chaos as backdrop to some world in some verse that oh happens to be earth somehow and at the same time for anyone with any education isnt  the first hour had me tossing my hands in the air for another dc train wreck  not only had to turn off plausibility but my entire brain
Dec 28 2022,positive,great movie dont reboot this universe dc
Dec 28 2022,positive,enjoyable standalone filmplenty of actionthough not enough in it for a franchise
Dec 28 2022,positive,the plot is nothing that the action scenes are nice and the comedy is not annoying
Dec 28 2022,negative,when pierce brosnan is easily the best part of a film you know it has problems
Dec 28 2022,positive,dang the hierarchy and power of this film is  good but not as great as i ever thought about it  black adam has a lot of intense battles getting man of steel vibes dwayne johnsons portrayal as teth adam is very cool and a worthy character to dc  problem though is the story too very whacky and nitpicking 710
Dec 28 2022,positive,i can agree with critics that the first 1520 minutes of the movie are uneven it is heavy on the exposition and not wildly engaging  in those early minutes dwayne johnsons trademark sense if humor doesnt quite hit the mark in relation to the other characters special effects were not great at the start of the movie but got better as the story moved along i dont know what happened but someone clearly fixed the problem along the way    in fact the whole movie found its stride and we found it very entertaining the younger actors were all really good and pierce brosnan is a gem in this film     johnson conveys the isolation of returning to a world that has long since passed your era by well the underlying themes of family community and what makes a hero are all timeless and the actors do a good job of making you feel the loss and the stuggle of the main characters and the community it takes place in    i went in with very little information about the comic book characters butni didnt need to be a fan to follow the story i got more than i expected to from this movie i hope you do too
Dec 28 2022,negative,i did not have high expectations for this movie i was bored that i missed 30 minutes and came back to it and didnt feel lost this was a basic superhero movie nothing new nothing exciting
Dec 28 2022,positive,fine movie rock performs his job fine for what it was hawkman was the worst part of the movie
Dec 28 2022,positive,it was super entertaining
Dec 28 2022,positive,was entertaining and not what i expected  has good bases for a sequel and the critics have been too harsh in their movie reviews  fun for the family
Dec 28 2022,neutral,not bad not good a solid meh the movie is full of tired superhero tropes but it is mostly entertaining good story not so much
Dec 27 2022,positive,the rock is my hero my hero 
Dec 27 2022,positive,enjoyable and parts funny and solid cast with pierce and dwayne
Dec 27 2022,negative,stopped the movie after 30 min casting was terrible beginning of story was amateurishly built up and choppy not sure who invested in this movie but i hope they remake it the right way at some point in time
Dec 27 2022,negative,good visuals nice action sequences unfortunately the movie confused my in many places character motivation development and actions didnt line up correctly way to often
Dec 27 2022,positive,very cool the rock kicks ass as usual
Dec 27 2022,negative,definitely some review suppression going on  this movie was awful
Dec 27 2022,positive,the movie is awesome just because people didnt see it in a theater before christmas doesnt mean it wasnt good rotten tomatoes its filled with critics that are too old and out of touch with todays audience
Dec 27 2022,negative,i heard you like cgi so i put some cgi in your cgi while you cgi
Dec 27 2022,neutral,so this film is good but not enough i didnt see a protagonist an antagonist or a hero screenplay is just absurd but i respect dwayne johnsons work and admire his acting skills
Dec 27 2022,positive,the action is good but it cant carry the movie on its own the story editing and overall tone are a scattered mess that bog down the excellent fight scenes pure popcorn flick but not worthy of any awards
Dec 27 2022,negative,me and my son rented over the holidays  watched the first 2025 mins and looked at each other and said nah  it was formulaic silly predictable boring and less
Dec 27 2022,positive,great film except for the main little kid  that kids acting sucks
Dec 27 2022,negative,chose it due to dewayne johnson  gotta respect his boot strap success  the movie started well then devolved quickly  turned it off 34 way through
Dec 27 2022,negative,i want to call this movie bland but that would be an insult to everything that is truly bland
Dec 27 2022,positive,great movie dwayne johnson does not disappoint he strays from his usual role of funny guy and it works for him and for those who are a fan of young rock youll enjoy a little surprise cameo my favorite dc movie thus far
Dec 27 2022,positive,movie was surprisingly good i enjoyed the goodbad guy complex
Dec 27 2022,negative,dwayne is a shitty actor
Dec 27 2022,positive,omg what a great movie  i loved every minuet of it tons of non stop action great effects and loads of suspence highly recommend
Dec 27 2022,negative,i like dwayne johnson but this movie was a terrible mishmosh
Dec 27 2022,negative,wow that was a sloppy mess  terrible screenplay and some generic action sequences  the only thing that i liked was the design of doctor fate and his powers    a production budget of up to 260 million for this mediocre mess is a massive failure of the producers  dwayne johnson played the most uninteresting superpowered character ive seen
Dec 27 2022,neutral,like most dc movies mediocre at best they need to make big changes maybe the ones theyve been making and stop trying to be marvel they try to throw funny light hearted scenes into a serious movie which just always jumbles how the movie plays out they make some scenes really unnecessary and just overall need a better development team
Dec 27 2022,positive,i dont understand why people hated this movie i loved it very much everyone has different taste of movies i believe people are being jealous of dwayne johnson being in a lot of movies and so they take there anger on his movies a fantastic and superb movie theres a saying dont blame the actor blame the writers producers and directors
Dec 26 2022,positive,epic movie definitely hoping dc can keep this character in the their movie universe i loved the story and action
Dec 26 2022,negative,so sad bad story bad script bad lines and bad actors  i really like dwayne johnson and piers brosman but not even them  can save a bad script please do better next time
Dec 26 2022,positive,meh it was fine slow at times it felt 30 minutes too long predictable and unsurprising in every way im stuck in bed with covid so i figured why not im glad i didnt pay to see it in the theater
Dec 26 2022,neutral,a failed opportunity to try and route the new dc another dwayne johnson movie with nothing unique in it nice vfx tho
Dec 26 2022,positive,writing is awfull and lazy a true meh movie
Dec 26 2022,negative,terrible movie taxation is theft this movie was beyond predictable and boring
Dec 26 2022,positive,not a masterpiece but good enough to watch with the family and have a good time
Dec 26 2022,positive,suuuper exciting and funny to watch 1010
Dec 26 2022,positive,one of the best movies with dwayne johnson great story and overall a 5 star movie
Dec 26 2022,positive,i like the movie fantastic supep
Dec 26 2022,positive,first half of that muvie was awesome but secend half was poor
Dec 26 2022,negative,just wasnt very good and im sick of seeing dwayne johnson he just plays himself in everything
Dec 26 2022,positive,generic superhero movie  pass on it unless youre really bored
Dec 26 2022,negative,looked good thats all
Dec 26 2022,positive,best dc film to date cant way to see where this leads for future films
Dec 26 2022,positive,a very good and fun movie the rock carries it on his back but the script is full of holes and is barely functional    its a movie to watch and have fun from destruction and the rock nothing else
Dec 26 2022,positive,gotta love the rocks acting
Dec 26 2022,positive,great introduction movie to the character
Dec 26 2022,positive,loved the cinematography got off to a rocky start and was extremely sceptical but it definitely gets better and better as it goes on a few scenesacting was b grade but some was excellent and new and exciting
Dec 26 2022,positive,okay at best theres still a lot missing for them to catch up with marvel though
Dec 26 2022,positive,when comparing it to other superhero movies its pretty generic but its still a fun adventure with pretty carismatic characters
Dec 26 2022,positive,it s ok best part is hennry cavill superman
Dec 26 2022,negative,it was bad i mean really really bad the rock doesnt really act although thats not unusual of course he just looks menacing the dialogue is terrible the plot is filled with tired action tropes the whole thing was completely predictable in every way  dc stinks up the screen once more
Dec 26 2022,negative,not good  dc is dead the guys are running this into the ground even marvel too star wars and star trek dead  they say the rock could not save it  he is part of the problem  he added drama to the fast and the furious series also
Dec 26 2022,neutral,theres a tone to dc movies that just does not go well with the acting style of the rock in this film hes too pulled in let the guy go in most films he goes smash kabam in this film he went clunk that coupled with a dull hackneyed plot made it a movie to watch while play a game on another device meh
Dec 26 2022,negative,meh when a character says never kill then also says surrender or die you know it is a green lantern moment very streamlined very predictable multiple times during the movie you go wtf and are taken out of suspension of disbelief nothing in particular wrong with the acting or effects just incredibly poor writing there will not be a second movie which tells you all you need to know about this one  i though green lantern was about as good
Dec 26 2022,negative,it starts out with a narration of a boy whos acting was reflective of his story telling the movie was overall bland and devoid of engagement that even the rocks and bonds presence couldnt salvage it
Dec 26 2022,positive,worth the watch for the rock and the effects storywise it could be much better  dissapointed but still entertained
Dec 25 2022,negative,bad storyline that was poorly executed there is constant action but most of it seems reason lees
Dec 25 2022,negative,visual effects were good but thats it
Dec 25 2022,positive,i enjoyed this sit back switch off your brain and enjoy
Dec 25 2022,positive,definitely not great but definitely not as bad as critics are saying entertaining from beginning to end
Dec 25 2022,negative,if you are developing a movie for more than a decade start with a good story not your ego
Dec 25 2022,negative,super cheesy uninteresting characters incoherent plotlines and world building  boring twist that was revealed in trailers washed out colours hard to watch without falling asleep or just switching to something else
Dec 25 2022,positive,the best hero movie of 2022
Dec 25 2022,neutral,the most frustrating part was that it was so close to being not just a good movie but a great movie the rock is such a great presence on screen and likewise with pierce brosnan    maybe hollywood could focus on story telling instead of special effects
Dec 25 2022,negative,2 hours and 5 min too long
Dec 25 2022,negative,firstly the only reason i watched this movie was due to the rock dwayne johnson and i can see why he would want to do the film                                                                   but not even the rock could save this film that was average at best
Dec 25 2022,positive,couldve done without seeing this movie
Dec 25 2022,negative,truly an atrocious movie i dont enter any movie with johnson in it with high hopes for his delivery yet this was even worse than normal
Dec 25 2022,positive,this was a great change of pace the audience score represents the movie more than what the critics are rating thats for sure i do hope they make a sequel as some point
Dec 25 2022,negative,unbearable the jokes were as flat the characters turned it off halfway through the movie blockbuster special effects but campy bmovie writing
Dec 25 2022,positive,it was really fun and the action was great but the writing and acting couldve been better
Dec 25 2022,positive,very good movie entertaining throughout plot was excellent and awesome post credit scene
Dec 24 2022,negative,watched for 30 minutes couldnt do it longer
Dec 24 2022,positive,a really good action movie
Dec 24 2022,positive,an absolute blast it is the most actionpacked and accurate dc movie to date all the characters are portrayed exactly as they would be in the comics
Dec 24 2022,positive,good guys dont kill people but maybe sometimes there should be an exception
Dec 24 2022,positive,great movie we loved every second the rock did a fantastic job in this movie i knew nothing about the characters but this is the superhero movie ive been waiting for
Dec 24 2022,positive,good movie i really liked the ending 
Dec 24 2022,positive,another dull superhero movie at least it can put a smile on your face with some scenes
Dec 24 2022,negative,boring concept campy vibe and uninteresting powers  this deserves all of the bad press it received
Dec 24 2022,positive,i watched it with not many expectation honestly first because i lost all hope in the dcu and second because i honestly didnt know much about the character well even so is far from being a masterpiece i kinda enjoyed it the plot is obviously nothing special but the fact that the character is basically invincible and for real this time not the usual rise and fall just to rise again at the end of the hero it makes this movie really fun to watch
Dec 24 2022,positive,i had really enjoyed film as their was a lot of action i also like how they included other heroes such as the justice society the periodic humorwit made the film enjoyable as well great job dwayne would love to see more from dc
Dec 24 2022,positive,good movie  not as bad as some made it out to be drfate really helped with keeping the movie captivating
Dec 24 2022,positive,the rock hes awesome the other characters were a little on the boring side but i hope we get to see a sequel
Dec 24 2022,negative,i love the rock and this movie was pure rubbish
Dec 24 2022,positive,im a marvel fan not a disney cinematic universe way   they have made so many fundamental mistakes that they and their sponsored critics avoid but are keen to surface for the poorly matched dc movies they review    enter the rock and very like zacks justice league it was sabotaged from the beginning    love and thunder ruined thor for me and countless other fans hes not a joke characterhero     yet that movie was ok     rock and cavil were doomed from the start by the pre release marketing sponsored by marvel including the payments to independent reviewers     some of us know    as said by a die hard marvel fan
Dec 24 2022,negative,i wouldnt call this a movie at allno plot just random scenes of explosions cgi and stupidity for 2 hours please tell dwayne how awful his movies are
Dec 24 2022,negative,so bad corny dialog unbelievable characters and subpar special effects marvel films are done so much better
Dec 23 2022,negative,not entirely sure what they were going for other than dark and violent story line was less than engaging and suspect the loud and wagneresque symphonic music was trying to create a diversion too bad
Dec 23 2022,negative,i didnt like the history its boring the special effects are beautiful but sometimes is completely confusing and exaggerated to watch movie just compensate if you know that the history is weak but the special effects are great
Dec 23 2022,positive,fun not pretentious a good movie in the superhero genre i loved it
Dec 23 2022,negative,no charisma a flat sense of humor and too busy and soulless
Dec 23 2022,positive,realty liked the story no enforced reeducation and well put together good acting and overall fit together well  pierce b was excellent and the rock rocked
Dec 23 2022,negative,no back story very shallow plot meh at best   some light shed from individual acting prowess from lead actress and pierce brosnan other than that meh
Dec 23 2022,negative,the movie was a mess with horrible dialogue graphics and action were fine but the movie lacked substance
Dec 23 2022,positive,meh usual rock flavor nothing special or interesting
Dec 23 2022,positive,watching this in the theater felt like it could be an attraction at disney world im not sure at home will deliver that same thrill but i cant wait to see 
Dec 23 2022,positive,rock did a great job   lots of action and special effects   i cant believe this got 39  it just shows you how out of touch the critics are with the average american viewer
Dec 23 2022,positive,easy the next mest dc move ever  o
Dec 23 2022,positive,enjoyed this having not known much about the comics and back story i like the casting it worked
Dec 23 2022,negative,ok marketing for nothing way below my expectations bad plot
Dec 23 2022,positive,loved it i dont understand why people dont like dc
Dec 23 2022,positive,i enjoyed it super hero movie but not like the others slightly dark in a way thats not weird
Dec 23 2022,negative,i had some expectations about this movie i was disappointed watching the rock acting on this movie was painful
Dec 23 2022,neutral,great action not so great acting story or characters
Dec 23 2022,neutral,couldnt get through it 
Dec 23 2022,negative,i really wanted to like this movie but it was just not good it was too cheesy and cringey had poor casting and storyline
Dec 23 2022,negative,just another dumb and bad written superheroes movie  they didnt even try to create a good and different story for the main character
Dec 23 2022,negative,worst movie ive ever seen not accurate at all
Dec 23 2022,negative,what the heck did i just watch and not finish it seemed like there were two different movies crammed into one and neither very good
Dec 23 2022,positive,not great but it is good movie to watch i enjoy it
Dec 22 2022,negative,if you like wwe promos youll love this film 
Dec 22 2022,negative,the tone was all over the place big let down
Dec 22 2022,positive,it was a really good movie
Dec 22 2022,positive,very beautiful with a good cgi and an originally story
Dec 22 2022,negative,the fact that this has an 88 from the audience ratings makes me think rotten tomatoes has a problem with paid review bombing this movie was so bad i turned it off half way through and didnt even bother to read up on what happened  how is it dc movies are always so inane  also pierce brosnan seems to pick the worst characters in the worst movies i used to love him but now think that if hes in it the movie is going to be unwatchable
Dec 22 2022,positive,this was exactly what i expected a fun movie with familiar tropes and lots of good dc characters we havent seen on screen before the rock is the rock and thats good brosnan as dr fate was excellent easily on par with many movies in the mcu and the cgi was quite good disappointing that gunn et all are walking away from everything
Dec 22 2022,negative,terrible acting cliche story ditch the kid on the skateboard mostly the skateboard but the whole character was terrible all of the justice society was terrible there were few redeeming qualities to this movie i think id rather watch the rock play a tooth fairy
Dec 22 2022,positive,this is a very entertaining movie with plenty of heart its probably one of the best things dc has done in a while and the rock did a great job they should definitely keep him in the dc universe
Dec 22 2022,neutral,it was clearly written and filmed like a wwe wrestling movie trying to be an over the top action movie the music and excessive slow motion battles got cringey really fast  glad james gunn is rebooting everything   sad that last part easter egg with henry cavill will mean nothing  was really looking forward to new superman but the cult of zack a small group of people have ruined everything and needs dc to start fresh
Dec 22 2022,positive,solid origin story movie this isnt a genre defining masterwork but if thats what you came looking for the problem is with you not the movie its fun and rewatchable its jot even 1 dimensional this movie is a better than average superhero movie
Dec 22 2022,negative,this inspired me to create an account and leave a review this movie got so boring i started wrapping christmas presents halfway through
Dec 22 2022,negative,nope  this was disjointed and cliched watched it for free and would not watch any sequels ive definitely reached a threshold of people in tights punching other people in tights in the face movies thats all this is why is dc comics so bad at movie making
Dec 22 2022,negative,this movie looked bad and only made it about half way before i couldnt take it  great special effects this director is awful and story is very choppy  boring just boring
Dec 22 2022,negative,wouldnt watch again looked alright now with henry cavil out dccinematicuniverse doesnt seem promising
Dec 22 2022,positive,loved this movie   the rock never disappoints
Dec 22 2022,positive,this movie gave us what we want in a dcmarvel movie lots of action plain and simple nowadays these kinds of movies have been ruined hope dc stays in this direction
Dec 22 2022,negative,poor character development convoluted storyline and bad cgi it wouldnt even impress 10 years ago just an overall cheesy terrible movie worst superhero movie to date
Dec 22 2022,negative,kids movie silly scripts unreasonable storyline
Dec 22 2022,positive,one of the best dc movies to date
Dec 22 2022,positive,all in all a good popcorn flick the plot could have been expanded somewhat but in the end it was fine
Dec 21 2022,positive,not as bad as people are saying it is in fact its quite enjoyable strong theme bright characters and great action
Dec 21 2022,negative,how on earth  can someone  get a script this bad  greenlighted im totally baffled with how generic  everything is and how  terrible the  dialogue is in this  movie 
Dec 21 2022,negative,not sure if ive ever said a movie has too much action but it was just everywhere very hard to follow any story when it just involves non stop fighting and killing
Dec 21 2022,neutral,the movie already got off with a bad start with the whole explaining the backstory through a narrator but it kept getting worse not a dictator but an intergang really   then the bad guy back stab way to early in a movie no suspence at all a couple of weird attempts at a comic releaf but neither the brotheruncle or atom smasher ever got really funny  but the worse part of it all was the kid that got the people to fight the zombies with that triangle sign it was totally unnecessary and pointless actually the whole hell on earth thing was weak    i really hoped i would like it because dc has so much potential and the rock can have his passion project but besides the visual effects it was a great let down for me
Dec 21 2022,negative,the effects of the movie is good but its the standard of hero movies nowadays the movie is alright if effects are important but the plot is horrible i was confused throughout the whole movie and why they even bothered having a story at all im sorry but dc movies today seem to always dissapoint me dont watch this one its 2 hours of your life wasted
Dec 21 2022,positive,i waited for this to come out on max but i would not have been upset if i paid money on a theatre it gets an unfair wrap and i genuinely laughed out loud a few times with the banter between adam and the justice society it would have benefited with some  editing down and leaning a little more into the justice society i felt it had the potential to be a much better suicide squad i have not seen wakanda forever but it is much better than anything i have seen from marvel since endgame
Dec 21 2022,neutral,i knew within the first 20 minutes that i wasnt going to like this movie its like a copy of a copy of a copy and the dialogue is awful
Dec 21 2022,positive,special effects were good but the movie became monotonous and i lost interest halfway through
Dec 21 2022,negative,watched this movie and it was absolutely disappointing i felt it was a rip off of all other dcmarvel franchises skip this movie hope they dont make another one
Dec 21 2022,negative,yawn the movie just was boring and a lot of it did not make sense  for example early in the movie a team of people have machine guns emptying everything on adam  so after emptying the whole clip on adam and never missing he throws his machine gun away and stares down adam and then goes for his side arm  why clearly bullets do not work  there were a lot of these scenes  poor writing decent acting good special effects  hollywood really needs to get back to writers being important to a movies success
Dec 21 2022,positive,loved the movie one of the best dc movies ever made everyone knows that rotten tomatoes gives the lowest scores to the best movies that how you know its going to be good when you see their low score and of course audience gave it almost 90 which is the real score
Dec 21 2022,positive,a lot of action good cast maybe a movie that all dc fans were expecting
Dec 21 2022,positive,great movie if if was stand alone i dont really see how it works with the dc universemultiverse but if you can disregard that its an awesome film great action sequences and storytelling cgi looks good too
Dec 21 2022,negative,its not worth your time to watch it 
Dec 21 2022,positive,better than all of the new marvel movies that have significantly better critic reviews if dc does not move forward with dwayne and henry after this excellent piece they will lose their largest fan base good luck dc this was an excellent movie there is still time to set things straight again
Dec 21 2022,negative,this movie inspired me to create a login in order to leave a review    i genuinely thought it would be better based on audience reviews i usually trust those    i regret having watched it on hbo max because i dont want them to misinterpret views as a need to make any more lazy movies like this so many moments it seemed like the editors or the writers or even the director must have just stopped caring and gave up arguing with dwayne johnson
Dec 21 2022,neutral,kept waiting for movie to get better waited too long
Dec 21 2022,positive,as an origin story i strongly disagree with a lot of the critics on this oneits a blast to watch the writing and storyline are just fine along with the fx this is an entirely entertaining movie with no issuesentertaining is the key issueno movies are perfect but this one delivers
Dec 21 2022,neutral,not really any story just things happening not bad but forgettable
Dec 21 2022,negative,2 hours of cgi with only 5 mins spent on writing or developing a script or plot terrible movie i kept watching waiting for the story to kick off but it never did just the same fight scene shot with the same cgi from different angels for 2 hours
Dec 21 2022,negative,not sure what is up with dc they should be the best movies because they have the best heroes and storylines but almost all the films feel second rate   this is one of the worst
Dec 21 2022,positive,lazada  internet intergram facebook lite apple shopping google
Dec 21 2022,negative,i did not like this movie i found the action and dialogue boring this is the worst super hero comic movie that i have ever seen
Dec 21 2022,positive,it was awesome a fun night out imo thats what is all about
Dec 21 2022,negative,this is the film that did it the film so awful that i finally had to make a rottentomatoes account this film was awful in every way which is really something so bad
Dec 21 2022,neutral,i am not seeing what the big deal is with this movie it was ok at best
Dec 21 2022,positive,overall an entertaining movie did not like the complete cgi based villain which is so typical of dc movies
Dec 21 2022,positive,great the cgi and the comedics and actions are awesome
Dec 21 2022,positive,it sucks that critics are bashing this movie i literally cant trust critics anymore its almost as if some big wig movie execs told them to hate the filmaudiences the ones who arent paid all say its great and i agree
Dec 21 2022,negative,it started okay but became a big muddled mess  by half way through i didnt really care what happened anymore  the graphics were nice though
Dec 21 2022,positive,i am surprised by the critics tepid reviews  while this film has plenty of flaws its at least an average dc comic movie with some good action scenes and reasonable story line i wasnt expecting academy awards but it entertained me  more than i can say for this entire summer of marvel flops
Dec 21 2022,negative,i like the rock but good lord the writing for that film was criminal the fact that people were actually paid to write that badly is shocking if i had invested money to produce this i would be angry beyond belief the producers and writers seemed to have thought ok the rock is loved by fans because of his personality so lets make sure his character has no personality and is as wooden as possible then as icing on the cake lets have 5 year old boys write the script ugh i need to take a shower to wash of the embarassment and shame i feel for spending part of my life watching this film
Dec 21 2022,positive,the rock and the rock
Dec 21 2022,negative,bad acting apart from a few cast members fight scenes that made no sense the story line left me thinking what whyyyy so many times the justice society was a joke so much time wasted watching them fight ba they didnt even come close to showing how powerful ba is but rather made him look weak the fact that this takes place in a world that has superman and every other superhero in that universe but no one ever came to this city to help the people is ridiculous the whole movie is we need a hero we need a hero the entire movie was disappointing i love the rock but his acting is not good they needed someone more believable to play this role so many moments that made no sense and was not even close to believable as far as what people would do in certain situations very frustrating and annoying to watch i really wanted to like this movie and was excited to see it pop up on my tv but its disappointing to say the least
Dec 21 2022,positive,this was a lot better than i expected dr fate absolutely owned every scene he was in too the rock was about what youd expect the two kids in the justice society were pretty poorly executed but the action scenes were top notch    dont expect any deep plot or heavy themes just a good popcorn muncher action flick better than most other superhero movies that have been coming out lately i wish i would have seen it in a theatre instead of waiting to watch it at home
Dec 21 2022,negative,its like an animated movie not only cartoonish in cgi but also in characters it shouldnt be recommended for adults this should be only for children max 16 years old a lot of bad dialogs
Dec 21 2022,positive,a few plot holes but not bad overall
Dec 21 2022,negative,its everything weve already seen except worse
Dec 20 2022,negative,the writing was horrible which pretty much tainted everything the acting wasnt bad honestly and the action was the most redeeming part of it but the actual story the screenplay terrible kinda on par with most dc movies really i wanted so much to like this but not even dj could elevate this train wreck of a movie
Dec 20 2022,negative,normally i like movies that the audience likes x4 more than the critics but not this one the dialogue was bad bad bad the characters were thin  maybe a good dc movie is an oxymoron
Dec 20 2022,negative,a lot of slow conversations you can see easily the green screen usage not a lot of lines or emotion for the rock its bad pause and silence moments
Dec 20 2022,negative,the movie was let down by sub par acting out dated special affects and an overly busy story line i was really disappointed i think my largest criticism stems from my early childhood where i was a larger dc comic book fan than a marvel one but marvel immerses you in their movies we all know its not real we all know its far fetched improbable  bordering even on the foolish but when you are watching a movie you want pseudo realism you want to believe in the moment your fantasy is reality and that is where dc is lacking on a massive scale
Dec 20 2022,negative,it was bad cringy lines and scenes and i think the only good thing of the whole movie was cyclone
Dec 20 2022,negative,this movie was hyperbolically overhyped by fans the rock was the rockhis acting is completely onedimensional the humor if thats what you want to call it was as corny as it was flat the kid was cringey throughout the one bright spot was pierce brosnan as dr fate and they wasted his talent in this film glad i streamed this for free because it was more booty than butt cheeks
Dec 20 2022,negative,i was wondering why the cgi were so bad and after seeing avatar2 i understood why because they are   the rest of the story and the lack of originality of that movie makes it really poor and uninteresting to watch the rock worst movie so far
Dec 20 2022,positive,really dumb yet somehow smarter than most recent mcu outings and not much of a villian really hurt an otherwise fun comic book movie
Dec 20 2022,negative,i honestly tried to get thru this movie 3 times but the cringey dialogue overdone cgi and lack of a coherent plot foiled me every time i like dwayne johnson in everything else but this was terrible
Dec 20 2022,positive,it was a fun dc action movie it wont win any awards but it was entertaining
Dec 20 2022,positive,the movie had lots of action and lots of cool special effects i like these kind of movies and a big fan of dc comics so right up my alley
Dec 20 2022,neutral,spectacular special effects aside this was a movie that seemed to have trouble picking a tone it was alternately dark and violent and yet the superhero gags flew around in moments that at times seemed inappropriate there was a dedication to reality with the frequent use of local languages but then dwayne johnsons title character begins speaking perfect american english with no explanation or obvious reason this was a script that needed some significant tightening up
Dec 20 2022,positive,this movie definitely makes the list of top 5 best movies dc has created from the cgito the actors to the storyline the whole thing was really unexpectedly good
Dec 20 2022,positive,as good as a origin movie should be yes the critics are gone say its clishe but its all we want from this sort of movie as audience
Dec 20 2022,neutral,heres the greatest big budget wwe match ever put to screen it has all the action very little plot and few character moments its a blast but bad film making if this came out when i was twelve i would have thought this is the greatest film ever made i saw the mummy around that age and loved the action the humor but then i got older and loved it for the wrong reasons this is a film that is fun but isnt ever gonna win an oscar and a better dc film in the later years kids will love it but adults will forget it    the action is good the cg is good except for those skeleton things and the setting is contained it has a lot going for it just doesnt follow through on the concept of plot
Dec 20 2022,positive,not nearly as bad as i thought it would be but im glad i waited until it came on hbo max
Dec 20 2022,positive,its about power we stay hungry we devour  put in the work  put in the hours and take whats ours
Dec 20 2022,negative,tried to to be marvel and dc at the same time characters all reflected marvels characters messy acting and the 2 minor characters were meh screwed up in the credits when he is visited by superman and they  just fired henry cavill movie tried to be too much hope there is no franchise or sequal
Dec 20 2022,negative,easily the worst superhero movie so far
Dec 20 2022,positive,its just a fantastic film
Dec 20 2022,negative,incredibly predictable plot linebad special effectsterrible castingwoof  dc had started to come around but this set them back again  not good at all  pleasedont just put jokes in these movies to say you did it  the humor is bland and very tropey
Dec 20 2022,neutral,it was an ok basic superhero movie almost feels like they had some actual conflict to set up and explore but they never quite got there
Dec 20 2022,positive,i was surprised how boring this was the acting felt stiff and the characters were just meh i just feel like dc is not good at this and needs to stop the direction they are going in 
Dec 20 2022,negative,the acting was wooden the heroes were not engaging the special effects were decent enough but they couldnt compensate for the onedimensional story and the lackluster acting
Dec 20 2022,positive,this movie was fun great sound track and entertaining story line  its everything a super hero movie is supposed to be
Dec 20 2022,negative,how is dc sooo bad at this     terrible dialogue weak plot development and the narrator feels like they recorded their audio on zoom     im so mad i paid for this one
Dec 19 2022,positive,critics can be really out of touch the rock was solid in the way you would expect the real treat was the excellent supporting cast the justice society is great
Dec 19 2022,positive,this movie was a good adventure the rock delivered it has grit i did become weary of the filters they used to make it look old and dusty and yearned for some brightness but the story was different and engaging
Dec 19 2022,positive,visually stunning excellent story line with good acting it was fun with dry humor the post credit is so well done i think its a shame dc is going another direction best dc movie since justice league
Dec 19 2022,negative,halfway through the movie i thought it was bad the second half confirmed it was bad
Dec 19 2022,negative,visually a beautiful movie but otherwise a lame story with stereotypical characters
Dec 19 2022,positive,a good movie suffers from the dcu random demon bad guy but other than that i enjoyed it does not deserve a rotten score at all sad that it looks like it is going to be cancelled
Dec 19 2022,positive,we went into it not knowing anything about the movie other than the preview and we really liked the movie  perfect amount of humor so didnt feel over the top like thor love  thunder  casting acting and special effects were perfect
Dec 19 2022,positive,good story and great action 
Dec 19 2022,positive,entertaining superhero action flick that is completely neutered now that they have pulled the plug on any connecting material
Dec 19 2022,neutral,an okay film dwayne johnsons passion for the character is on display in the titular role and carries this simple story
Dec 19 2022,positive,awesome movie absolutely fresh
Dec 19 2022,positive,best of moviestv series collection
Dec 19 2022,negative,i love the rock but this movie was not about the rock it was about establishing the poor supporting characters that i ended up not caring about whatsoever by the end the only thing that could have saved it was if the fonz showing up and taking his suit back
Dec 19 2022,negative,warner brothers does it again they throw spaghetti at the wall and when they realize that concept doesnt work they serve you the spaghetti from the floor anyway nothing new different or moving quite the opposite actually old tired and stale
Dec 19 2022,positive,i watched it with low expectations after hearing all the negative reviews but i thought it was a very entertaining movie the acting was good the special effects were great the story line was pretty cool too i think it was one of the best movies of the dc franchise
Dec 19 2022,negative,i love the rock one of my favorite actors however this was probably the worst movie i have ever seen in fact i couldnt watch till the end it was too painful bad acting bad director the plot makes no sense
Dec 19 2022,positive,i like dc and i like marvel but dc movies have let me down more than they brought me enjoyment this was probably the first dc movie that when finished i actually found myself having enjoyed it yes it was a bit wooden maybe at some times   and the im no hero and then doing hero things part was a bit hit and miss but i genuinely enjoyed dwaynes performance and the look and feel of this movie   i probably would have scored this movie lower if the other dc movies were a bit more on point but i feel this is a big step in the right direction for me that equates to a bit of a higher score from me
Dec 19 2022,negative,underdeveloped storylines and incomplete elements they seemed like the movie was filmed with 50 people did they use the budget up on cgi cause that was great just thought they could use more extras in the movie
Dec 19 2022,negative,great action for 10 of the movie but overallstorycharacters and just the overall plot is bad
Dec 19 2022,positive,so good must see the best thing a super hero movie can do is bring attention to things that are wrong and give us a new narrative about our own power and remind of all that is good that we want to protect this movie does that its set in a military occupied arab city not unlike possibly iraq we dont usually see positive movies about arabs and for that i really enjoyed this story and all the actors writing effects are amazing if you think about the world and like to explore new narratives about people we think we know through the media watch this
Dec 19 2022,positive,i saw the guy from jumanji and he said the line shazam and the audience cried and cheered because after the premiere we found out that zoa was 30 on amazon for the next few hours
Dec 19 2022,neutral,it was entertaining but a bit dry at parts
Dec 19 2022,positive,how many times can super hero movies rehash the same story i thought it was good but not at all unique get them some writers
Dec 19 2022,positive,as far as dc movies go this wasnt bad  could have been better  sets up a lot of potential future story lines
Dec 19 2022,negative,my husband love herovillain movies i van enjoy them but without a great story i will grab my phone and start to read or if my family is watching i will start to joke with them to my husbands dismay because he likes to focus this movie 20 mins in he was bantering with us because it wasnt the best movie the plot was draining and at one point i was falling asleep i bet on a theater screen it would be impressive but on our big screen and surround sound this still was not enough glad they paid for good cgi or its ranking would be close to the 3rd mummy movie
Dec 19 2022,positive,had high hopes and it was okay at times but overall disappointing
Dec 19 2022,negative,my gosh cannot even describe how painful and sad it was to watch all that money for a good production beeing throw on such a terrible movie bad in every ways
Dec 19 2022,negative,tedious the cgi was par for the course for the budget not sure what people see in this  i lasted 45 minutes before i just had to stop watching
Dec 18 2022,positive,i dont why this movie got panned it was so great highly recommend free on hbomac
Dec 18 2022,positive,the rock was a perfect choice for this character brilliant film
Dec 18 2022,positive,loved it regardless of criticisms definitely worth seeing
Dec 18 2022,positive,omg what a great movie    i loved every minuet of it  tons of non stop action great effects and loads of suspence  highly recommend
Dec 18 2022,positive,this was amazing love the cgi and action scenes overall had a great plot and just an all around great movie
Dec 18 2022,positive,awesome my whole family loved it at the theater
Dec 18 2022,negative,2 hours of my life i wont get back sad as i was looking forward to this for a while not quite as bad as aquaman but it looks like that was their goal
Dec 18 2022,positive,loved it dark funny really good
Dec 18 2022,positive,plenty of action as you would expect  i had hoped for better  better writing more complex characters  oh well
Dec 18 2022,neutral,formulaic and unmemorable i like the rock but this was not worth the money they spent
Dec 18 2022,negative,i love the rock but the overuse of cgi and dialogue made this show a lame one for me  the best part of the movie was seeing henry at the end credit scene  he makes superman without having to say a word
Dec 18 2022,negative,terrible lifeless the rock just floated around while bombs go off around him nothing could hurt him very disappointed
Dec 18 2022,negative,poorly cast the rock is plain and bland big muscles doesnt mean they are worthy of every role sad to see they went this direction
Dec 18 2022,negative,lose action out of the storyline comments fractured movie i barley made it to the end
Dec 18 2022,positive,good story good action
Dec 18 2022,negative,i wanted to like it because of the rock but its bad the justice society was done better on smallville and other cw shows
Dec 18 2022,neutral,i found it too much of everything too long too much action almost all the same too much visual effects etc i quite enjoyed the beginning and the slight plot twist but that was about it
Dec 18 2022,positive,really good entertaiment i had really good time with it didnt like how the final boss is defeated but  that post credit scene wooo would of be so great to have that    gc
Dec 18 2022,negative,if you like cliched superhero movies endless overthetop fight scenes and find good writing superfluous then this is the movie for you
Dec 18 2022,positive,i was concerned at first but its honestly a great action movie some good catch phrases great graphics and it has the rock doing what he does best  the ending credit scene is worth price of admision
Dec 18 2022,positive,surprisingly good film you hear how bad it is but finally see it my dad and giggled the entire time and loved it 
Dec 18 2022,negative,extremely dull plot a complete mess of a movie with a terrible cgi that even marvel would laugh at full of awkward moments and terrible acting
Dec 18 2022,positive,i really loved the movie the action was great and it opens a new world for dc
Dec 18 2022,positive,loved the action through out the movie with a sense of humor definitely family oriented movie and i would watch this more than once
Dec 18 2022,negative,its whatever passes for a average dc movie these days
Dec 18 2022,neutral,it was alright but not one of my favours
Dec 18 2022,neutral,it was better than i anticipated but still not that good it was entertaining in a way  too many shiny things  what was hawkman wearing  another bad guy with horns  cmon dc
Dec 18 2022,positive,fantastic addition to the dc verse well thought it storyline and hoping for a sequel
Dec 18 2022,positive,great action  special effects we look ditto the sequel
Dec 18 2022,positive,the movie was pretty good probably one of the better dc movies
Dec 18 2022,negative,just watched this on hbo  this is a horrible movie  i usually like movies with the rock but not this one  hard to believe this movie was made  i was very disappointed  they also try to make one of the characters like dead pool and it comes off as cheesy and stupid  i wish i had better things to say  this is by far the worst movie i have seen the rock in    by the way many of the action sequences are so bad and the slow motion sequences are painful  not even any good lines from the rock  the more i think about this movie the worse it gets
Dec 18 2022,positive,not much of a story line  lost interest about halfway through the movie
Dec 18 2022,positive,the critics are morons this was a great movie
Dec 17 2022,neutral,the acting in this was not great the cgi was also pretty weak and leaned upon too heavy it had some cool moments and i thought centineo and brosnan were bright spots
Dec 17 2022,negative,lame jokes and lazy writing
Dec 17 2022,positive,really fun action packed comic book movie
Dec 17 2022,neutral,movie was good enjoyable story was not good at all but action was great
Dec 17 2022,positive,i love dwayne in anything this film was less entertaining than most of his efforts a fuller cast might of helped instead of dwayne and the children
Dec 17 2022,positive,great moovie action and references at all times
Dec 17 2022,negative,its astonishing how consistently bad dc movies are i remained optimistic but alas this is yet again another lame attempt to be even half the movie marvel can make characters are pathetic plot is convoluted and slow
Dec 17 2022,positive,i thought it was actually one of the more entertaining dc movies up to about half way and then it went south too much cgi created fight scenes i would not spend money on this that much is for sure
Dec 17 2022,positive,themes of moral ambiguity and neoimperialist misadventures in the middle east beneath the usual comic book movie trappings would have been far braver and much more powerful and interesting if the baddies had been the actually existing american military hegemony instead of cartoonish villains to be dispatched on a whim instead the film squanders the opportunity to make an authentic point and seems only to attempt to justify that selfappointed protectors of the people shouldnt have qualms about extrajudicial killing which is to put it mildly in an era of increased awareness of police misconduct an extremely dubious conclusion
Dec 17 2022,negative,boring lots of action for sure decent acting but ultimately the plot was just too boring the ethical delimmas encountered in there was just the same that weve seen in the previous 352 superhero movies
Dec 17 2022,positive,im not sure what professional critics are looking for in a superhero movie but if youre looking for the notebook as a superhero movie dont hold your breath this movie is pretty much in line with what the audience wants to see the acting was average thats being generous because the teenage boy in the movie was pretty bad but the storyline special effects and fight scenes were great
Dec 17 2022,positive,the movie was very good
Dec 17 2022,positive,was actually expecting this to be an awful movie but i actually ended up enjoying it alot to the point where i saw it in cinema twice pacing is a little off the justice society could of been fleshed out better and theres alot of action but this movie is fun and if its entertaining then its already good to me pierce brosnan is definitely the highlight of this movie its a pity with james gunns reboot we willmay never see this adaptations of the characters again
Dec 17 2022,negative,its sad to see how much budget gets thrown at terrible scripts over and over again another visual bate to make big dollars only enjoyable if stoned enough to not care about the story
Dec 17 2022,positive,is it a 5 star movie no but i just want to cancel out someone who gave it a 1 star cuz yall always shitting on dcu  this movie is not a bad movie there are things that are dumb about it like how everyone speaks perfect english but that same thing happens in the mcu as well  its also a struggle seeing the rock play the lead role because being a straight forward no smile killing machine is not his strong point obviously his strong point is modernized versions of shakespeare but overall it is no worse than half the other superhero movies produced in the last 20 years
Dec 17 2022,negative,i watched a little more than half hoping it would get better and it never did the movie was just special effects no story to it the trailer was way better than the movie
Dec 17 2022,negative,dc action scenes all seem to look the same storyline was convoluted and didnt track with the larger universe which is a larger dc issue terrible dialogue and story and honestly didnt care who won in the end no intro for these new supes at all why can mcu look cool and also have a story but dc cant
Dec 17 2022,negative,i had high hopes for this with the rock being on of my favorite action guys but bad acting jumbled story no flow at all  just flat out a bad movie
Dec 17 2022,positive,  this was a really good movie i dont understand all the fuss but look at the critics vs audienceit was one of the best movies this year this could potentially set dc on the right pathbut i got a feeling dc will screw this up somehow as well
Dec 17 2022,negative,i really hoped this would be good but what a disappointment parts of the story made no sense at all and a lot was a ripoff of other better super hero movies effects were good but effects cant save a bad movie what a shame
Dec 17 2022,neutral,decent action but dialogue and acting didnt evoke much feeling from me
Dec 17 2022,negative,scenes and dialogue stolen from a bunch of other movies
Dec 17 2022,negative,its easy to guess and the script is quite oldfashioned most of the actor are unrecognizable except pierce brosnan and the rock the plot is not impressive focusing on action scenes and special effects
Dec 17 2022,positive,great movie the characters where great imo the action was exactly what i wanted finally a movie that shows what these super heros are truly capable of cgi was alright not the best not the worst but most of the time i didnt really notice when something looked kinda weird comedy was perfect not to many jokes jokes where fitting for each scene and character over all great actioncomic movie
Dec 17 2022,positive,i think the films is stylistic i dont think its perfect dwayne performance was acctually amazing the action the emotion the characters except for amon i really fucking loved it its not perfect but i really loved it 75100
Dec 17 2022,positive,solid movieand decent performancesthis film is underated60 rtplaced in between suicide squad and shazam ahem jl universe respectively this movie is another dc gem
Dec 17 2022,positive,fun entertain film with good visuals but weak storylinecheesy dialogue terrible plot holes
Dec 17 2022,positive,incredible movie and very entertaining until the end
Dec 17 2022,positive,the best dc movie to date
Dec 17 2022,positive,was ok    and now its wasted
Dec 17 2022,negative,struggled to watch this had to do the skip watch where i had to eventually skip skip watch skip skip watch who is directing these
Dec 17 2022,negative,lots of effects  george lucas once said a special effect by itself is a pretty boring thingwhich describes this movie  script is very scattered and not well written  producer and director are just not very good at what they attempt to do
Dec 17 2022,positive,i loved it definitely want more hawkman in the dc universe
Dec 17 2022,positive,it definitely had some lame dialogue and the soundtrack could use work but i really liked it it was fun entertainment despite superhero fatigue i would still like to see something next for every character in this film sadly i know that isnt to be
Dec 17 2022,negative,right off the bat ill say what i liked i liked the characters of the justice society that they brought into the story to stop teth and the dialoguehumor between them plus maybe just a couple of the action sequences were good mainly with the speederbike like things and with dr fate toward the end    other than that it had a rushed somewhat predictable and poorlypaced plot and editing and directing that was mostly sloppily done and made the film underwhelming at a certain point it was a pleasant surprise to see superman in the postcredit scene but now thats ruined by the fact that henry cavill is no longer returning as the character which makes it kind of for nothing overall i must say i liked shazam 2019 better it was much more down to earth and had more heart to it im not too happy that i decided to check this one out
Dec 17 2022,negative,unspeakably boring the writers at dc maintain their position as the worst in the business none of the jokes land and the characters are just flat stereotypes the rock should stick to hosting gameshows thats where his charm actually works
Dec 17 2022,positive,loved it lots of action great acting very good story fairly family friendly yes i highly recommend it james welch henderson arkansas 12162022
Dec 17 2022,negative,this is a b level cw series at best i didnt think anything could be worse than the scorpion king but here we are
Dec 17 2022,positive,this was a good movie it is ridiculous that the pro critics hate everything unless it is an endless protest disguised as a  film
Dec 17 2022,positive,i mean it was really fun to watch this film but if youre expecting to see something different in the superheroe genre this is not the film for you the rock is playing himself and the story get all over the place as the movie progress
Dec 17 2022,positive,it was fun better than people made it out to be light hearted fun movie for a friday night 
Dec 17 2022,positive,best super hero movie
Dec 17 2022,negative,too much action confusing plot dont know good guys from bad guys   should have waited for it to be streamed
Dec 17 2022,negative,bad acting c actorsother than 2 horrible special effects its more of a comic book from the dollar tree definitely not impressed boring and fake pandering
Dec 17 2022,negative,just watched on hbo pretty dumb and formulaic ego vehicle for the rock too bad it may have helped ruin cavills future as superman
Dec 17 2022,positive,its not perfect but it feels like a return to form for comic book movies very politicking lots of excellent scenes
Dec 17 2022,positive,bro is that the rock11111
Dec 17 2022,negative,worst movie i have seen in a long time
Dec 17 2022,positive,better than any marvel movie that ive seen lately funny witty and well acted loved the action scenes too
Dec 16 2022,positive,what this movie lacks in the way of a logical plot it makes up for with superb action sequences a fun comic book movie even if it doesnt always make sense
Dec 16 2022,negative,such a nothing movie with nothing to say im getting sick of these high budget flashy nothing movies almost as disappointing as morbius
Dec 16 2022,negative,if a movie has too much hype on it then its very bad i am not surprised new dc management pulled the plug on future dc projects
Dec 16 2022,neutral,dwayne johnson showing us once again he only has one personality and cant act not one good actor in the bunch the action scenes were good even if weird high tech thirdworld jumbled
Dec 16 2022,negative,could have been so much better loved the rock but disliked every other actor and their story lines 
Dec 16 2022,positive,dc finally stepped up and made a solid movie
Dec 16 2022,negative,a big fan of the rock but this was such a disappointing film  bad vfx and his usual charming presence is completely missing
Dec 16 2022,negative,terrible no wonder dc is rebooting the entire universe again 
Dec 16 2022,positive,too many effects fights and characters too little story and the actors play very poorly im a big fan of the rock or pierce brosnan but in this movie the director didnt know what to do with them
Dec 16 2022,negative,this movie makes the best case yet for james gunn rebooting the entire dc universe
Dec 16 2022,neutral,just the rock with superpower nothing more generic plot weak villain
Dec 16 2022,negative,hes just not a good actor definitely a character actor
Dec 16 2022,positive,as far as superhero movies go this is up there with aquaman and batman for me im looking forward to more especially if henry cavill maintains his role as superman
Dec 16 2022,positive,awsome movie best superpower movie in a long time
Dec 16 2022,positive,great movie with a great story and a lot of heart
Dec 16 2022,positive,its an solid action movie i like the why not kill the evil guys behavior because its something new for an superhero film but as so often there is a bit too much of the the hero is invincible trope so the film become boring at some points
Dec 15 2022,positive,a lot like justice league the movie introduced a handful of new characters besides adam with little to no back story and so that was a bit of a surprise overall though there was a lot of good action and character building moments and dwayne johnson shined as adam i cant wait to see where it goes next 
Dec 15 2022,positive,its an actionsuper hero movie  not perfect but going to win any awards but it is fun the rock isnt allowed to really show off his real charisma in this role but i enjoyed it   there are some parts that drag and some characters you could do without but for the most part its enjoyable and a good time
Dec 15 2022,positive,very nice movie the rock delivers and the cameo of cavill is a nice addition heavy action with a nice pace and interesting development
Dec 15 2022,positive,the story and the final twist make it super interesting and it can be the beginning of great stories for dc movies i think the direction and construction of the effects and the film itself are good
Dec 15 2022,negative,this movie was a disaster its a long fight action scene that lasts 2h with no time to breath characters were empty and it was impossible to have any emotional connection with them so disappointed in dc once again
Dec 15 2022,positive,loved it entertaining and lots of tongue in cheek dry humour a nice departure from the usual superhero films
Dec 15 2022,positive,much better than almost all the other dc movies
Dec 15 2022,negative,one of the worst superhero movies ive ever seen  also one of the worst rock movies  very disappointing
Dec 15 2022,negative,became tedious at times the main characters appeared and with the slight exception of the titular character were not developed much at all  the interrelationships wore on with no palpable change in respect andor revulsion  the interplay of the two old superheroes against the young superheroes was absent dwayne johnson is flat and very one dimensional in this film  he showed much better acting chops in his earlier films such as walking tall and rampage
Dec 15 2022,positive,i thought the structure was odd all the plot is at the end of the movie with the front loaded with action sort of action action  plot action epilogue  but very much enjoyed it despite that
Dec 15 2022,positive,amazing action packed the film didnt lose the story and it had your attention the entire time
Dec 15 2022,positive,terminater 2 without judgement day more funny moments brosnan was superb as always while hawkman needs recasting just like rhodey in iron man 1
Dec 15 2022,positive,i loved it it was way better than the recent marvel movies
Dec 15 2022,positive,the rock fits this part perfectlymovie was great
Dec 14 2022,neutral,very average would not rush to see it again
Dec 14 2022,positive,it was enjoyable fun fast moving but you were able to get the story
Dec 14 2022,positive,great superhero film with lots of action a fun plot twist and a surprising guest star in the midcredits scene
Dec 14 2022,positive,black adam is a thuggish movie from beginning to end with very beautiful and well produced cgi the actors are great especially dwayne johnson and pierce brosnan the story has its script problems but nothing that detracts from the experience of the film the postcredit scene adds a special touch to the end of the film
Dec 14 2022,positive,enjoyed the film but just too much going on with characters with barely any back story its like the original rubbish version of justice league in terms of how the story comes together its all clunky dc just need to stop trying to make a film like the avengers before theyve done origin storiesthat is how you can relate to the film more 5 super heroes all start in one film come on quality over quantity dclike aqua man imagine aqua man instead with dr fate and other dc heroes that havent had a film yetbut all in 2230hrs its why zacks justice league was 4hrs and it was amazing   trying to squeeze so much in with so little background just doesnt work
Dec 14 2022,negative,would not recommmend
Dec 14 2022,positive,exciting enjoyed the action
Dec 14 2022,negative,cgi fest but not in a good way far too much exposition not just at the start but regularly through the movie takes you out of everything and it feels like a badly put together set of action sequences
Dec 14 2022,negative,i really wanted to like this movie i went in thinking how am i not going to like a rock movie but man this was just bad the acting and scenes were so extremely 90s c movie list cheese the boy never listening to anybody and always doing what he wanted and always stating youre a hero youre a hero it came off as a very irritable short round from indiana jones he just never listened and who can actually get away from anybody riding a skateboard too i dont know it was just so dang corny throughout the whole thing honestly if they ever try to do a part 2 i think me and my entire family have already said were out its just such a 90s cheese fest movie
Dec 14 2022,positive,not the rocks fault the acting was pretty great across the board its the screen play that let us all down
Dec 14 2022,negative,dc has got to do better  the cameo in the credits was the best scene
Dec 14 2022,positive,its ok nothing earth shattering the rock is fantastic but its a weak plot and script
Dec 14 2022,positive,the hierarchy of power might not change right awaydwayne johnson and company provided an action packed project but very little else its not for lack of trying there are some interesting components to the story that they incorporated however theyre not compelling enough to get the viewer invested
Dec 14 2022,positive,i enjoyed it greatly   loved the rock  loved the story  love to henry cavils superman
Dec 14 2022,positive,very entertaining a good hero movie as expected from the rock it wont change your life but you wont get bored thats for sure
Dec 14 2022,positive,i enjoyed this movie  it is a good time
Dec 14 2022,positive,the production design was great and so was the special effects as a person who watches a lot of marvel movies in my opinion it seemed like a lot of the heroes were just copycats of marvels heroes  as a person who doesnt have a lot of knowledge of the dc universe maybe i missed a few characters but i will say the cyclone character development was horrible honestly her powers were nothing against the people they were fighting against it was like she was jus there to be there  and the same for atom as well not enough character development as well i am a film major at columbia college chicago so i am picky with a few things for people who really dont pay attention to too much detail will enjoy the movie for people who pay attention to detail and how different aspects of what makes a great film wont really enjoy the movie
Dec 14 2022,positive,flat out start to finish and visually impressive by far the best dc movie made and hopefully the standard for the future of the dc universe would rate it above any marvel movie after infinity war
Dec 14 2022,positive,nothing special   decent super hero flick
Dec 14 2022,negative,just an insanely boring superhero movie filled with endless action and no storyline whatsoever
Dec 14 2022,positive,one of the best superhero movies in years loved it

Dec 13 2022,positive,very interesting and entertaining superman cameo was the bomb
Dec 13 2022,positive,good action but bad story
Dec 13 2022,positive,very middle of the road and forgettable some fun momments but overall nothing new
Dec 13 2022,positive,better than i thought it would be lots of twists
Dec 13 2022,neutral,is it really as bad as people are saying it is no is it good also no
Dec 13 2022,positive,awsome movie to watch
Dec 13 2022,positive,not a typical dwayne johnson movie it wasnt bad i may watch it again in the future parts of the movie feel like it just drags on its not hard to follow it is kinda predictable though not real suspenseful the graphics and special effects were really good though dwaynes costume did not look right on him they could and should have done a lot more with it
Dec 13 2022,positive,will be buying the blueray
Dec 13 2022,positive,this film is a very simple superhero film thats not about a super hero which is the problem hes a villain and they want you to be sympathetic cause its dwayne johnsonthe cast ok story is weak
Dec 13 2022,negative,the plot was poorly written and lacked any real substance the characters were onedimensional and lacked any real development the acting was wooden and unconvincing overall the movie was a nonsensical mess that left me feeling frustrated and disappointed avoid this film at all costs
Dec 12 2022,positive,i really enjoyed it one of the best dceu films ive seen and dwayne johnson absolutely nails it as black adam
Dec 12 2022,positive,excellent origin story was an action packed feast with some nice humour tossed in in bits pierce brosnan as dr fate knocked it out of the park as did the rock visually stunning
Dec 12 2022,positive,good films dislumbrant special effects great action scenes but the only part that had i dont liked is the family scenes
Dec 12 2022,positive,best superhero movie of the year
Dec 12 2022,neutral,meh it wasnt very good
Dec 12 2022,positive,lots of action lots of fighting lots of electricity and lots of people in support    just more evidence that the critics were wrong as usual
Dec 12 2022,positive,thought it would be a more positive superhero it was more a arrogant one not my idea of a role model superhero
Dec 12 2022,positive,this movie was absolutely incredible the action the effects the story all of it captured the attention of the audience and held it for the entire film pretty pathetic that rotten tomatoes rated it so low when the audience the people who matter absolutely loved this dc gem
Dec 12 2022,positive,the movie itself had a lot of poor writing and some not that great cgi even some acting was off but i thought it was a fun watch so i think that kinda evens the scales the critics score is still out of touch tho
Dec 12 2022,positive,movie is even good but still lacked something to be a spectacular movie but its still a good movie
Dec 12 2022,positive,this movie was amazing little slow to start but i highly recommend  action packed

Dec 11 2022,positive,awesome great action excitement humor and a dash of light hope to see more productions like this from dc comics
Dec 11 2022,negative,poor the whole film seemed to be cgi poor story
Dec 11 2022,negative,cliché characters plus generic plot plus boring cgi equals dull uninteresting mundane movie but they keep doing it over and over they keep doing it over and over over and over see what i did there thats this movie the same components from other movies reused over and over every character was a cardboard cutout their personality was obvious and the dialogue predictable and the plot was even more predictable then the dialogue where have i seen this plot before in every other comic book movie and many other movies also even commercials have cgi now cgi has become passé and boring cgi does not make a movie good the entertainment industry is kaput all the music sounds the same all the movies are the same all the shows are the samewell most of them wednesday was decent this movie was not
Dec 11 2022,negative,horribly disjointed key characters that you dont care about or even know their names plot twists that a kindergartener could figure out very predictable outcomes   this was a cheap marvel ripoff the rocks muscles are big though
Dec 11 2022,positive,dont expect too much
Dec 11 2022,positive,so much action loved every minute
Dec 11 2022,positive,i feel like the cgi withe devil guy was pretty weird but overall a good movie
Dec 11 2022,positive,this movie was a good watch the critics should have gave this movie better ratings
Dec 11 2022,negative,lost interest about half way through nonstop action mixed with often overemphasized music for the scenes like a bad trip with no rest
Dec 11 2022,positive,nice movie the rock the best 
Dec 11 2022,positive,just really loved it great movie perfect audio during the movie
Dec 11 2022,positive,its not perfect but it really is a good dc product the visuals and characters are the best story more or less but it is a good movie for having a lot of heart and soul
Dec 11 2022,positive,lot of action great movie
Dec 11 2022,positive,good movie but i lost my wallet
Dec 11 2022,negative,lousy visuals cg and poor story line
Dec 10 2022,negative,dialogue was terrible and everything was super cheesy the movie is only good when nobody is talking
Dec 10 2022,negative,i just couldnt get into this really boring and im a dc fan that often likes anything dc
Dec 10 2022,positive,great movie finally a respectable release
Dec 10 2022,negative,could have been so much more  find a better actor that is not so one dimensional
Dec 10 2022,negative,wasnt good while also not terrible dwayne injects too much cheese into serious scenes and the fighting looks far too stages which is saying something for dwayne due to this being another dc film i didnt go in with high hopes saying that it was very disappointing that dc didnt try to use this opportunity to create something good given their long record of failures
Dec 10 2022,positive,a really good movie id recommend to watch
Dec 10 2022,negative,money cant buy love or apparently fix a bloated uninteresting vanity project the rock has never been less likable
Dec 10 2022,positive,it was alright story droned on for too long
Dec 10 2022,positive,i liked the movie i thought it was actually an entertaining and worth watching especially after watching some of these other crazy movies i think this movie is going to do well and reruns and on other platforms
Dec 10 2022,positive,it has to be in my opinion one of the best dc movies they have in the bag i was not disappointed what soo ever
Dec 10 2022,negative,i struggle to find something positive in this mess of a movie
Dec 10 2022,negative,i dare say below par for dcwband for the record par for dcwb fails to make the cut the writing is bad the dialogue tortured and the attempts at drama  emotion are so uninspiring they border on corny the best part of this film is the subplot of the lesser heroes which has that refreshing feel of the cw series dcwb put out the cgi is pretty good overall and its very good on whirlwind 
Dec 10 2022,positive,fantastic action but the story line and characters were quite flat  i suppose if you are a fan of dc comics it may appeal more as you may know who these random super heros are  at times i found it cheesy   the kids liked it but was a little underwhelmed at times  may be one to watch again when it comes out on tv
Dec 10 2022,positive,i liked it for a dc movie marvel still has the lock on superhero movies but it did keep me entertained i thought the story could be a lot better but the acting was great for what they were working with
Dec 10 2022,positive,this movie got a bad wrap just due to the fact that the rock is in it the acting isnt that great and doesnt follow the comics but you just got to take it for your typical superhero movie
Dec 10 2022,positive,way better than most of the latest marvel and dcu movies definitely better than shazam
Dec 9 2022,negative,the twist should have been the movie it was the only part of the plot with any hint of character development at least now we dont have to wonder what it be like to watch a humorless version of the demigod maui amon is moana ismael is the coconut pirate king dr fate is heihei cyclone is the ocean the crown of sabbac is the heart of tahiti atom smasher is the pile of rocks
Dec 9 2022,positive,great fun time action packed and really great characters
Dec 9 2022,positive,good story good action and good humor
Dec 9 2022,positive,i really dont understand the hate
Dec 9 2022,positive,was an action packed feastwith some nice humour tossed in in bitspierce brosnan as dr fate knocked it out of the parkhe was amazing
Dec 9 2022,positive,had a lot of special effects loved the actors really good movie i would purchase this movie
Dec 9 2022,positive,i finally got the chance to go and catch this movie and it is so good two hours of non stop action that leaves you wanting more while there could have been a little bit of improvement on the storyline the overall experience of this movie feels like a typical dwayne johnson film a lot of action with just a slight pinch of humor great film overall and cant wait for more
Dec 9 2022,negative,this movie had so much potential pierce bronson kills as dr fate aldis hodge is absolutely brilliant as hawkman but not even the rock could save this movie dc is suffering from a bad habit of slow motion overuse the rock honestly looked like he didnt even want to be there
Dec 9 2022,positive,a lot of slow motion fight scenes i call it horse back riding reminds me of old westerns that showed a lot of time riding horses across the prairie to stretch things out
Dec 8 2022,positive,like its alright the story is a bit confusing but i think its just me but other than that its okay i would recommend this movie to other people it has a great cast but the trailer kinda spoiled the entire moive
Dec 8 2022,positive,very good action movie for a new super hero character 
Dec 8 2022,positive,a good refreshing super hero film my only complaint is that its in the endless flood of super hero movies
Dec 8 2022,negative,a movie too focused on its action sequences that it forgot to add a decent story
Dec 8 2022,negative,laughably bad but at least youll laugh the line reads are almost as bad as the lines themselves and the director has somehow made his multimilliondollar budget look like an oversaturated superbowl commercial
Dec 8 2022,positive,this miove is so good and is getting hate because of biased marvel fans hatting
Dec 7 2022,negative,very bad movie tried to watch twice but could not get through a half hour to bad i thought it would have been good with the rock
Dec 7 2022,positive,plenty of humor for a dark superhero movie enjoyed
Dec 7 2022,positive,good movie better then the last few marvel movies and im a big marvel fan
Dec 7 2022,positive,the movie is a good time if youre there just to have fun i wouldve liked more as far as story goes i also wanted the rock to be full on villain as black adam instead hes like an in between herovillain
Dec 7 2022,positive,this an awesome movie dont listen to critics if you want to see negativity you can read critics some people people who have given below 35 like to see negativity in everything you will regret if you dont see it once 
Dec 7 2022,positive,i think it was amazing i hope to see another one soon doctor fate was really awesome story line was really good black adams story was truly well written
Dec 7 2022,positive,just alright nothing special
Dec 7 2022,positive,really enjoyable film and definitely better than anything marveldisney has released recently
Dec 7 2022,negative,i was really looking forward to this movie but apart from the first 10 minutes and sara shahi it was terrible constant cgi close up battles which remind me of michael bays cut action scenes from transformers after 30 minutes i fell asleep and when i woke up i hoped the movie would be over soon the story doesnt make any real sense the mightiest warrior  who can take it up with super man  is focused on freeing the state kahndaq from a mercenary organization named intergang basically he could have ended that movie in 1 minute but its taking him the whole movie then a league named justice society tries to stop him  why  dont waste your time and money
Dec 7 2022,positive,yeah its very polished all actors do a great job fun ride emotional hooks werent quiet what they could be but fx work is so so good story is solid not overthought no real surprises  internet ruined the hc return as sup but so glad to have him back  id say solid 775 out of ten  nice additonal to the dc universe finally heading in the right direction for live action need to draw more inspiration from the animated movies  they are amazing  i own all of them also cast members who deminish the brand with bad public behaviour should be punted simple as that enough with ezra miller with great power comes great responsibility
Dec 7 2022,positive,for an action super hero film it was great dc is starting to finally step up with this genre the casting was perfect too this is looking really hopeful for the direction the franchise is going in i cant wait for the sequel
Dec 7 2022,positive,great movie 1010 would definitely recommend
Dec 7 2022,positive,story plot wasnt easy to follow move slow in the middle of the movie
Dec 7 2022,positive,loved every moment  i guess rotten tomatoes doesnt know everything after all 
Dec 7 2022,negative,good writing and direction could have made it a decent movie
Dec 7 2022,positive,overall it was good but volunteering to lose powers with no objection from dr fate who should have known they needed him was a bit strange
Dec 7 2022,positive,i like the action and the peace that end up at the end
Dec 7 2022,negative,a long wait to get the same cookie cutter approach to every superhero film
Dec 6 2022,positive,i loved the rock being a super massive murderer 3
Dec 6 2022,positive,first and foremost this movie is fun the pacing is great meaning that youre never far away from the next set piece  it breezes past the less than intriguing story this is the best time ive had at a comic book movie this year
Dec 6 2022,positive,great movie lots of action
Dec 6 2022,positive,awesome storyline love the rock
Dec 6 2022,negative,is for me perhaps one of the worst superheroe movie of all time
Dec 6 2022,negative,about the worst movie i ever had to sit through
Dec 6 2022,positive,honestly didnt expect much but i really enjoyed the movie hoping for a sequel
Dec 6 2022,negative,i watched for the rock however if fell asleeptwice
Dec 6 2022,positive,true enough to the source material to avoid upsetting fans of it while still making enough changes to keep the story relevant to modern audiences very fun to watch and provides a deeper characterization of its cast than we usually see in superhero movies
Dec 6 2022,positive,this is a perfect role for d johnson the story was decent but it was pretty good film and great to see the rock in a rolecharacter like this
Dec 6 2022,positive,movie was overall good cgi needed to be improved on the villan but overall one of the best 
Dec 6 2022,negative,bad story line over done special effects a real loser of a movie and i paid for it
Dec 6 2022,neutral,it was just ok i was hoping johnson would save dc but that didnt happen
Dec 6 2022,positive,1010 would recommend story was a little confusing to begin with but explained pretty quickly and so engaging definitely want to watch this story line as it continues definitely would watch again screw the other reviews
Dec 6 2022,positive,a terrific popcorn flick doesnt take itself too seriously and isnt meant to be cinematic masterpiece enjoyed the characters and story plan to see it again
Dec 6 2022,positive,great movie with just enough twist to keep you engaged i would certainly recommend it and hope theres a sequel
Dec 6 2022,positive,phenomenal movie visuals plot  the rock becoming the character outstanding
Dec 6 2022,negative,very disappointing and wasted my money
Dec 5 2022,negative,not very good the rock plays himself once again and the movie does nothing risky or above ok
Dec 5 2022,positive,i enjoyed this movie and would recommend seeing it in the theater if possible i will purchase this movie when it is released on dvd as i believe it is that good
Dec 5 2022,positive,unreal film great story line full of action give me some more of this dc
Dec 5 2022,positive,i loved the effects the plot of the story leaves one wondering why the shazan movie is there and how in the end this question is clarified  it left me wanting to see the second one with superman
Dec 5 2022,negative,the plot is too cheesy the trajectory of the scenes and its emotional release dont make sense also how can he speak an old foreign language but wake up speaking english and then why black adam dont get the title cos there is nothing black about nothing
Dec 5 2022,positive,great movie and story
Dec 5 2022,positive,i really liked this film  great action scenes  great acting done
Dec 5 2022,negative,one of the worst movies i have ever seen it was blah had to watch it in an hour segments
Dec 5 2022,positive,i loved the movie it was excellent  funny and kept you on your seat
Dec 5 2022,negative,has humanity ran out of original stories kudos for the special effects but that is all that is acceptable in this movie and to please me you need to do a lot better than some fancy fx the writing is terrible filled with boring cliché scenes and stereotypical deus ex machina results the movie was 100 predictable and lacked originality i weep for humanity
Dec 5 2022,positive,way better then i expected nice to see a good dc film
Dec 5 2022,positive,not bad  nice twist on the story
Dec 5 2022,positive,i loved it great action and the acting was spot on some funny moments as well as serious moments great job
Dec 5 2022,positive,enjoyed it there were some things that i questioned but it didnt ruin the whole story for me
Dec 4 2022,positive,you have seen this kind of story before many times but its strong cast including some great supporting roles good sense of humor and strong action make it one of the best blockbusters of the year
Dec 4 2022,positive,great action awesome fight scenes
Dec 4 2022,positive,this was a treat the imagery and the movement was fantastic black adam was incredibly impressive the story was good and engaging and the music was excellent
Dec 4 2022,positive,glad i didnt listen to the critics  much better than i expected
Dec 4 2022,positive,satiated boring and then it got better
Dec 4 2022,negative,it had some good cgi but most ofi t was just fighting and like 1 minute of actual plot
Dec 4 2022,positive,it is a very good film in which you can see a high quality of work it has plot holes but they can be solved in a second installment
Dec 4 2022,positive,loved the movie the dcu needs to keep up this momentum sometimes the world doesnt need a white knight but a black one
Dec 4 2022,positive,slick and polished but the story just didnt have the pop like a marvel movie my favorite part when henry cavill shows up  that was spectacular the rock is good but hes way better in jungle cruise props to sarah shahi she just needs better movies to star in
Dec 4 2022,positive,awesome movie even better than expected
Dec 4 2022,positive,one of the best action movies i have watched so far it has great sound track epic fights scenes no unnecessary jokes and alot of character development these critics who are rating this movie lower is because it has no cringe woke messages in it as the mcu movies usually do thus they rate them higher this movie points at a bright future for the dc universe and i am waiting to see what the guys at dc come up with next
Dec 4 2022,positive,i thought this movie did a pretty good job of introducing the new character black adam into the larger universe the fight scenes were good the history of the character was decent could be better i thought they at least attempted to tell a little story of the other justice society characters im looking forward to more
Dec 4 2022,positive,the rock is still not that great an actor but his charm and the great supporting cast make up for it here
Dec 4 2022,positive,movie wasnt that good but it has a lot of potential to grow into something bigger in dceu i actually enjoyed the movie time well spent that after credits was awesome too
Dec 4 2022,positive,respects the origin of the character in the comics it has perfect cgi and excellent action scenes i dont think critics have ever read a comic where black adam was present
Dec 4 2022,neutral,a bit painful  and i am sick of all the references to the rest of the universe of characters and stories it did not grab me
Dec 4 2022,negative,black adam finds dwayne johnson a brilliant actor in the comedy action genre embarrassingly engaging in a bottomless trove of vfx and cgi our children have long figured out on their gaming consoles     while serious practitioners of the craft hold their noses and refer to the tools as a necessary inconvenience waiting for abuse a daniel daylewis metric would accord johnsons adam a minus five on a scale of 10 for being paid to be airborne instead of practising the craft     given that tom clancy said that when you discern fact from fiction fiction itself has to make sense practitioners even in the comedy action genre must resist taking any role and financial gain at the risk of compromising their brand which forces them to fly about willy nilly looking like fools to market themselves     peace    tommy peters
Dec 4 2022,positive,i would watch this movie again the kid was annoying but overall good movie
Dec 4 2022,positive,very good plot alot of modern movies are fx cgi heavy without a good story line black adam has both good effects and a great story line havent seen pierce brosman in awhile  his character added to a great cast made this my favorite of 2022
Dec 4 2022,negative,this movie sucked thats all i need to say
Dec 4 2022,positive,the movie is superior to what marvel has us used to if i was sleeping with thor with black adam i was excited i think that if they have a dc direction it surpasses marvel as before
Dec 4 2022,positive,a darker dc movie and underappreciated dc is finally figuring out why their animated movies succeed and their box office fails because they dont cater to the right audience age forget the marvel model and give me more watchmen this movie was adult enough but could have been more mature with dr fate cyclone hawkman and sabbac this movie has everything for the casual viewer and comic book nerd alike
Dec 4 2022,negative,quite a terrible watch
Dec 4 2022,positive,  this is a movie for the audience not the critic so if you like hero movies you will enjoy the rock kicking bad guys
Dec 3 2022,positive,go d johnson and supporting cast well done
Dec 3 2022,positive,no wokeshit its finaly a good movie
Dec 3 2022,positive,not a huge dc fan but i enjoy this movie the rock played a good role
Dec 3 2022,negative,flat dialogue poor pacing rushed origin then utter cgi porn   in general a real let down  about an hour in id lost interest  however it may provide a platform for something going forward
Dec 3 2022,positive,love the rocs acting and he did not diss appoint great cast and enjoyable movie
Dec 3 2022,negative,for a performer whos always strained a bit to hard to please its surprising he would allow this script and character to lay do flat  building a story around really overblown action  sequences over strong writing and 3 demential characters give you just this kind of expensive boredom
Dec 3 2022,positive,the movie was very entertaining the characters were fun to watch i liked the humor strung into the movie the only set back in the movie was the villain i wished they would have given the antagonist a bit more depth but beyond that entertaining
Dec 3 2022,positive,well developed story and plot twist love the integration of already known superheroes
Dec 3 2022,positive,this so weird i am totally opposite what the professional reviewers think i was entertained the woke factor was at a minimum it was decent story telling  i guess this is why the audience score is so high and the critics scores are so low
Dec 3 2022,positive,i call this movie an amateur movie morbius thor 4 and venom 1 and 2 are in the same definition this movie is trying to be marvel  just a weird movie i was not impressed  but the movie was just pure fun i enjoyed it a lot even though its not a good movie
Dec 3 2022,positive,was very entertaining  i have been pretty much burned out of the comic book movie thing for a few years because they just started to get too boring and offer very little entertainment   its refreshing take to have a hero that became one against his own will lost his family and has been sentenced to an eternity of pain i love the heroes attitude and the amount of destruction that he can unleash just because other villains and heroes have something to prove for ego or purpose by confronting him
Dec 3 2022,positive,another superhero movie made ok by the rock 
Dec 3 2022,positive,its ok not the best but at the same time not the worst
Dec 3 2022,positive,that was some good watching
Dec 3 2022,negative,shit acting not natural dialogue predictable story line no depth
Dec 3 2022,negative,i love the rock but dang they must have paid him a lot to be in this movie lots of plot holes and rushed dialogue
Dec 3 2022,positive,the people without a secret agenda see this as a great movie and real dc fans see the way this movie helps pull every movie dc has made up to now    black adam has a powerful place in the future of the dc universe and dwayne johnson played this character extremely well
Dec 3 2022,positive,great story line and it has lots of action with very little fluff no foul language but lots of violence
Dec 3 2022,positive,great movie  loved all the action and powerful characters
Dec 3 2022,positive,the movie was good but predictable the hawk man character and romance between cyclone and atom smasher seemed a bit forced when compared to dr fate all in all one of the better dc movies
Dec 3 2022,positive,another reason not to listen to critics the movie looked great cgi was on point had tons of action and kept me and my son entertained i would watch it again looking forward to the sequel
Dec 3 2022,positive,one of the most entertaining dc movies ever
Dec 3 2022,negative,yikesi love the rock and his movies hes been a refreshing addition to hollywood but that said this movie was probably to good to pass up playing a superhero   the script was obviously mediocre and he seems like hes eother being badly directed or trying to hard and is out of his league here maybe both wait for this movie to be free to watch definitely not worth paying money to watchkind of painful actually
Dec 3 2022,positive,amazing job dc need more movies like this the rock rocked black adam
Dec 3 2022,positive,this was a very good movie  forget the critics they werent enough gay stuff for their bought out reviews by hollywood if its not empowering women lesbianism or gay then its a bad movie for the critics youre right considering its your job to promote everything gay you do have another choice though which is to shut up and let the audience enjoy the movie it was created for the audience in case you forgot audience has enjoyed the movie its one of the very few movies id watch again it was action packed with enough humor
Dec 3 2022,positive,i loved it lot of action  great special effects all the characters great especially dwane johnson playing black adam  looking forward to part 25 its really a great movie loved it got a poster 2    thank you
Dec 3 2022,positive,lots of action superman cameo was too little after having to watch the obligatory hubris of hollywood
Dec 3 2022,negative,wow was this bad the comedy was horrifically bad cgi was mostly good but some bad story lines were weak choppy and just bad pace was extremely too fast there could be almost know connection made with any of the characters this movie shouldve been so much better it sure was hyped to another level acting across the board was pretty bad
Dec 3 2022,negative,wasnt a huge fan of this movie and im a sucker for comic book movies the story was pretty weak some bland characters and a deluge of worn out comic book movie tropes i read in another review that black adam doesnt have a single original bone in its body and i think that might be the best way i can summarize this movie    some decent action scenes decent visual effects and pierce brosnan are really the only things struggling to carry this movie to 2 stars
Dec 3 2022,negative,this movie made me bleed from my eyes omg every scene made me roll my eyes gosh my eyes hurt
Dec 3 2022,positive,hit or miss acting to certain characters but other than that it was still a great film
Dec 2 2022,positive,a little conflicted dark and confusing but good segues into need for another film its clearly not a heroically hurray villaindefeated its on to the next super villain happily ever after like most comic book hero movies i really need to see it again rented or buy so i can understand it a bit more
Dec 2 2022,negative,a confusing production trying way to hard to be the avengers superman lotr and many more all at once most scenes are rushed and few are very original you can do better than this dwayne
Dec 2 2022,positive,probably better than most dc superhero movies it introduces an antihero to the mix with some relatableredeemable qualities the formula is more or less the same though as any other similar film and the cgi is pretty bad for todays standards i felt the rock felt awkward in the role at times and solid at others hit  miss
Dec 2 2022,neutral,black adam relative to other dc films is entertaining but remains another one dimensional outing the rock as black adam was great casting however the origin story gets trashed in favor of the current day action doctor fate lacks the punch he had in the comics and hawkmans angerfest is a bit overbearing even if it is true to character not worth the trip to the theater but good as a rental
Dec 2 2022,positive,omg it was good good if i watch movies again i watch again 
Dec 2 2022,negative,i like the rock but the movie depended more on cgi then on acting  and the dialogue sucked as well as the scattered storyline
Dec 2 2022,positive,maybe has its flaws but its a refreshing nonstop action movie with a charismatic lead maybe stupid and naive but i think this is what we need especially when other cbm are filled with left propaganda the message and political correctness
Dec 2 2022,negative,predictable story not funny when movie was trying to be
Dec 2 2022,negative,bland all that really needs to be said
Dec 2 2022,positive,it was really fun to watch
Dec 2 2022,positive,was kinda cool ngl  typical super hero movie though
Dec 2 2022,negative,black adam has a potential if they didnt add sabbac and his crown to the story if dceu focus to black adam jsa and the aspect of a true heroheros judgement of good and bad it would be great
Dec 2 2022,positive,it was pretty good i enjoyed watching it the rock shows off some great acting chop with the quiet pain and conflict he holds in not the best movie but very entertaining
Dec 2 2022,positive,i was entertained i loved the rock in it but i have to admit he was a bit overshadowed by dr fate and hawkman the villain needed a better storyline but beyond that a very entertaining movie
Dec 1 2022,positive,loved it critics got this so wrong not every superhero movie needs to have a sociopolitical agenda its just a fun cartoonish movie with some great effects and world building recommended
Dec 1 2022,negative,the action and soundtrack were good but for me the rest was just forsing jokes that werent funny at all and a big lack of character development movie was 2 hours long but still somehow seemed unfinished the post credit scene was good but yes other thing were just bad and its a shame movie had great potential
Dec 1 2022,positive,it was very very good  to me better then black panther 2
Dec 1 2022,positive,this is the movie of the year
Dec 1 2022,positive,i really liked this movie especially the characters of black adam and doctor fate the music was awesome combined with the thrilling fight scenes and genuinely funny moments the one thing that kinda bugged me was some lines could have used a little more power behind them like when amon addresses the khandaqi people at the end of the movie but other than that its a fantastic watch and i recommend it highly excited to see where this leads to
Dec 1 2022,negative,i found an accumulation of nothing with nothing no scene was impactful terrible script characters without any development the deaths had no feelings and the villain was not even a true villain
Dec 1 2022,positive,the movie was just good it was like watching a minecraft quick run the movie starts and then suddenly comes the jsa vs theth adam dispute and at last comes a man like hellboy called as sabbac who means nothing to the character  black adam doesnt feel evil but still i give a 35 as it gave a comeback to dceu in a really good manner the superman cameo is the best part of the film and otherwise the film is good and worth watching
Dec 1 2022,positive,started uninteresting then the storyline picked up
Dec 1 2022,positive,black adam movie was epic 
Dec 1 2022,negative,messy plot weak lines
Dec 1 2022,positive,it is an solid movie how they introduced the black adam into the dc universe is extremely awesome hawkman nailed his role i dont know why they choosed cyclone and atom smasher into the justice society especially cyclones powers really gave an eye sweat both should have been used in a better way dr fates powers doesnt look enough still he is the most powerful sorcerer he should be back in future movies the villain of this movie sabbacs cast should be replaced with someone less annoying this is an total rocks show and the justice society leader must be little more matured
Dec 1 2022,positive,overall an enjoyable movie however the story got a little ridiculous towards the end specials effects were great though
Dec 1 2022,negative,too fast paced didnt get to know the characters that well some scenes with the boy and mom and ridiculous
Dec 1 2022,positive,forget the critics they dont know what they are talking about i have gone to see this movie four times i wasnt die hard dwayne johnson fan but this definitely made me one this movie was so good so action packed and the story is so good i will say the ending with the final battle scene was a little too short it didnt matter because the true purpose of dc story telling was definitely done right this time i encourage you to watch it and keep an open mind
Dec 1 2022,neutral,very mid movie the parts without the annoying kid and the jsa were decent
Dec 1 2022,negative,makes me not want to see super hero movies anymore  missed the mark
Dec 1 2022,positive,i feel like the movie was better than i thought it was going to be the storyline was pretty solid the acting was pretty good a good amount of twists and turns a pretty solid ending and the rock did a really solid black adam pose sets up a pretty good stage for the future
Dec 1 2022,positive,not having read the comics i was entertained from start to finish
Dec 1 2022,positive,action packed funny dwayne johnson kills it as black adam the supporting cast was great as well
Dec 1 2022,positive,dont believe the professional reviewers this movie is fun and thats why we go to movies
Nov 30 2022,positive,as usual most dcu offerings are a bit underwhelming  too bad though  i generally like dwayne johnsons work  this is one of my least favorite dwayne johnson films  it didnt do a good job of utilizing his abilities  the film was what youd expect for superheroish action films these days  of course they did a decent job with the special effects but it all seemed overblown and the central focus of the film  entertaining enough but nothing special in my book
Nov 30 2022,positive,loved it hope to see more
Nov 30 2022,negative,the action was amazing but the story felt too fast paced to even be considered a story no actual heartfelt moments and weird side jokes that made it seem more like a sitcom than a movie all in all action good acting a little rough
Nov 30 2022,negative,it was fun to watch and the characters are likable enough to hold my attention just not much else but that
Nov 30 2022,negative,all that we saw already over 100 times
Nov 30 2022,negative,to be honest is a classic rock movie you know what i mean
Nov 30 2022,negative,way too much hype way too long to wait for a bla movie i did expect a lot more from the rock its too bad
Nov 30 2022,positive,wasnt as bad as people are banging on if you like a usual actionsuperhero flick you wont be disappointed  some of the lines were corny other than that decent watch
Nov 30 2022,positive,tell them the man in black sent you    its nice to see the rock slow down on the jokes and i think hes cast pretty well in the role i think the heroes around him are all really well cast brosnan was a genius move and atom was a joy    theres some ropey cgi but for the main part it holds together well and it doesnt rush from location to location i thought the atom size changes were well handled and put together    however    theres some clunky dialogue and forced exposition the son of adrianna couldnt hold together two shows let alone inspire a town of people to put their hands together in solidarity ever scene he was in brought the film down after black adam showed up     the plots run of the mill and starting to get a bit annoying but if this is the start of what the rock claims is a new phase of films and the superman cameo is a taste of things to come maybe we can look forward to some improvements as the teeth stop wobbling
Nov 30 2022,neutral,its ok  its not as bad as the critics say but its far from great
Nov 30 2022,positive,dwayne johnson is just amazing 
Nov 30 2022,positive,it wasnt the worst in most dwayne the rock johnson movies he is well himself in this movie he is a darker more powerful and more commanding character never cracking a joke the fight scenes are good but the character development was not sorry
Nov 30 2022,positive,hope black adam wins honestly vs superman   hard to find someone to beat superman but now we got few that can even stand close to him hope they dont kill adam off its about time for few new heros tired of remakes with same heros but i love movie black adam hope to see more of the rock playing him perfect for role hope theres more
Nov 30 2022,negative,meh they did try
Nov 30 2022,neutral,black adam is a mess luckily its a very fun and enjoyable mess the story is everywhere but most of the characters are enjoyable the rock is great as black adam and the action scenes are the highlight of the movie
Nov 30 2022,positive,this movie was amazing i waited 6 years for this movie to come out and i finally got it not only that now i got henry cavil coming back as superman 
Nov 30 2022,positive,i stayed awake for the entire movie
Nov 30 2022,positive,i love the dc movies didnt like that someone was trying to kill a child as per my daughters words
Nov 29 2022,negative,to much hype put me to sleep within the first 30 minutes 
Nov 29 2022,negative,the acting is bad the script is bad the flow is bad
Nov 29 2022,positive,it was a fun dc movie but thats about it i loved the cast but the movie had plot lags like every dc film to date outside of the batman franchise
Nov 29 2022,positive,its a good movie even if it has some boring and tiring things its fun maybe id recommend it but its not all that
Nov 29 2022,negative,bodhi sabongui  this actor destroy the movie  and all for young actors so bad
Nov 29 2022,positive,very good but the rock was not the best superhero in the film that goes to the guy in the helmet pb
Nov 29 2022,negative,1 it was disney  what was they thinking  2 it was dwayne johnson the trader his career was over if they wouldve had a different actor it mightve did better  3 where was shazam  4 it was predictable and loud to the point it was boring  5 it was like it was just throwing together like pumpkin pie without the whip cream
Nov 29 2022,negative,this film is very entertaining but poorly written
Nov 29 2022,negative,great cgi decent actors like all dc movies but the plot is just action and fight scenes over a narrative that leaves you indifferent lots of marvel copycat inspirations with nothing but noncharismatic heroes and vilains dwain remains the actor and no one really cares about the outcome
Nov 29 2022,positive,finally another anti hero villainsuperhero action movie with tons of action dr fate should have had more time however i cant be to upset because they brought him back out for the main event dwayne johnson the rock did a great job playing his role
Nov 29 2022,negative,the rock was not believable too much fighting  noit enough storyline and whats up with the flaming skeletons
Nov 29 2022,positive,it was a fast paced dc movie they could have gotten a bit deeper into the characters
Nov 29 2022,positive,i really enjoyed the plot of the movie and the writing it got a little dark at times definitely at least pg13 i would not recommend taking kids to see this movie but it is excellent for young adults
Nov 29 2022,positive,amazing  smart to cast pierce  always a fave
Nov 29 2022,positive,this movie was so infravalorated by the critics because it was a great movie with great visual effects and great acting specialy from aldis hodge and pierce broseman pierce broseman as dr fate totally steals the showhe is great
Nov 28 2022,positive,much more enjoyable than i anticipated well worth watching
Nov 28 2022,positive,awesome movie i hope dc keeps on this track solid story a bit classic on the general lines but good writing and awesome action scenes makes me feel like well an action movie that is what it is supposed to be right    all heroes featured are well done love hawkman and the aftercredits scene is perfect     im sorry i could not watch it at the premiere
Nov 28 2022,neutral,sort of ok plot twist was a welcome surprise
Nov 28 2022,positive,my kids really enjoyed it cool storyline
Nov 28 2022,negative,its not even a movie so bad
Nov 28 2022,negative,95 of rotten tomatoes users scored this as favorable exhibit 1 on this stupid corporateinfluenced metric is bought and paid for this movie is braindead floaty and weightless written as if for 7 year olds that need an emergency hyper show in response to running out of ritalin no animals were harmed in the making of this movie and no human stunt doubles were either because they didnt get hired because everything that moves is a purely animated puppet
Nov 28 2022,positive,your typical average and dumb fun superhero movie that you will forget about with time the best part about it was the excitement from the end credits scene
Nov 28 2022,positive,awesome great cfx great story
Nov 28 2022,positive,great story and action also good comedy setups too loved it
Nov 28 2022,positive,i enjoyed this movie so much  this felt like a comic book movie  i liked how they incorporated other dc elements and i loved the post credit scene    this is a good time at the movies
Nov 28 2022,positive,this is a very good film i really like the story brought by dc and the rock actor
Nov 28 2022,positive,critics were hating cuz the rock didnt show emotions what do they expect after everything his characters been through hes a higher power and i think he played it great for real they played him this movie is dope asf funny great action cyclones powers looked amazing she entered the battle field doing 1000 cartwheels like comon how can yall be hating these critics need to get they heads out there ass
Nov 28 2022,negative,one of the worst superhero movies ever made thor and deadpool are masterpieces compared to this the defeat of some city of baghdad throughout the film who are the screenwriters who paid their salaries
Nov 28 2022,positive,not sure what movie the critics were rating but thought this was a really good step in the right direction for dc movies
Nov 28 2022,positive,i loved it and thought that it was the role that the rock dwayne johnson was born to play as he himself has said in so many words in interviews promoting the film but i enjoyed all the characters and the actors who played them  it was especially gratifying to see pierce brosnan on the silver screen again and looking very different from his remington steele and bond days  i loved his look in this film  without ever having read the dc comic i still was able to enjoy the storyline and particularly the history of the character and his country  it even seemed to reflect world conflicts of this day and age and have a lesson for the global powers that be  another enjoyable aspect of the film not giving away any plot points was the technique in editing of slowing the action down until it is almost stopped kind of like a still photo a painting or yes a frame from a comic book  its been used in other comic based films such as marvels avengers films but it was especially well done and beautiful in this film  all and all a very entertaining superhero film
Nov 28 2022,positive,good action for a superhero movie 
Nov 28 2022,positive,this movie give us at least something diferent and fresh i loved it
Nov 28 2022,positive,entertaining movie rock played character pretty well and solid super heroes not too hard to follow
Nov 28 2022,negative,weak story line relied completely on its special effects would not be able to sit through again my 8year old however thoroughly enjoyed it
Nov 28 2022,positive,dwayne johnson trained hard for this movie and wasnt shy to bringing us a 100 a game to this film
Nov 28 2022,negative,rubbish waste of time and money
Nov 28 2022,positive,as a real superhero movie fan not some overpaid critic i can say this is the movie dc needed great work hope they continue to build off this and bring together a legit dc universe
Nov 28 2022,negative,shocked that it wasnt better the reviewers must be just trying to prop up dc universe dwayne usually has good movies this was just him murdering people
Nov 27 2022,neutral,i just feel that marvel spent a lot of time developing their superheroes and their identities and were supposed to just get to know who this lot are in one movie where their characters are already established i turned this off 23 of the way in the justice society whats that all about yeah just a bit boring really
Nov 27 2022,positive,gooooooood movie but didnt have dawynes iconic wink
Nov 27 2022,positive,dont get the problem critics have with this film its a superhero action film what do they want it has great action sequences a few classic dj sarcasm nods good supporting cast  yes they try and squeeze in a massive amount of storyline but if it was made 10 years ago when it supposed to have then it couldve slotted in with the rest of the dc more easily so now its been crammed in to fit
Nov 27 2022,negative,good film however a bit too cheesy for me
Nov 27 2022,negative,not impressed it s very copypaste from other movies lacks story content not seeing it would not have been a lost
Nov 27 2022,positive,its a pretty decent movie and better than most of what disney has been turning out the last couple of years the rock did a great job
Nov 27 2022,negative,really dumb but a lot of fun
Nov 27 2022,positive,let me preface this review by saying that james gunn is the worst thing that ever happened to super heroes movies while his sense of humor isnt the funniest it works on gotg but thats it since guardians was well received people have been trying to fit the same style of jokes in the hero movies ever since and black adam is no exception and dont get me started on the atom smasher being the same character as peter parker from the marvel movies    while i like the rock his acting skills arent enough to carry the movie the writing follows the current hollywood trend of being terrible and the movie has pace problems most of the visual effects are very good and so is the sound editing oh and i really didnt liked the costume design    there are some huge differences from the comics and i have some qualms about the casting but all in all black adam was a more pleasant experience than shazam and even with all the flaws it was a very entertaining movie specially if we compare it against marvels phase iv
Nov 27 2022,positive,absolutely amazing  loved the graphics  deffo would give it a watch  i want to watch it again lol 
Nov 27 2022,positive,great movie with good fight scenes and excellent cgi comedy in the right tone and within the limit
Nov 27 2022,positive,ive enjoyed it will my wife and kids and my family friends
Nov 27 2022,positive,absolutely the best dc movie to date   from the plot to the acting and special effects everything was done right
Nov 27 2022,positive,quite a great superhero movie a few scenes that got somewhat cringy and lackluster but in the oversall sight this was a solid movie with good relation building towards the characters all the critics that are review bombing this due to the fact it as i great movie with alot of actors of colors should be ashamed
Nov 27 2022,positive,pretty good redemption of the character not dumbed down for the kids different than the usual mcu type fluff pretty good
Nov 27 2022,positive,this is a super hero movie it isnt meant to be a new schindlers list so for super hero movies it was superb
Nov 27 2022,positive,very entertaining  and excitement throughout movie
Nov 27 2022,negative,wow  the critics score was correct  so why is the audience score so far off for this thing  apart from maybe 2 or 3 slightly amusing jokes this thing is painful from start to finish
Nov 27 2022,negative,rubbish a total time waste
Nov 27 2022,positive,great storyline and amazing cinematic
Nov 27 2022,negative,a complete lack of character development and an unimaginative plot made this a snoozer
Nov 27 2022,positive,action packed held my attention from beginning to end good vs evil good wins many great messages including the message that we get to choose whether we will be heroes or villains no one gets to decide your value freedom doesnt come until the people decided to fight for their freedom i could go on but i dont want to spoil it great movie 
Nov 27 2022,positive,i thought the movie was awesome very well done cant wait till the next one
Nov 27 2022,positive,enjoyed the story visual effects and the fight scenes some odd choices for dialogue but overall a great action movie with a a stronger story than what passes for movies and tv shows these days
Nov 27 2022,negative,an act of cringing nothing else
Nov 27 2022,negative,the storyline was ok special effects were ok dwayne johnsons acting was ok costume design was ok overall i can think of no better word to describe the movie than ok passes the time but i dont think it paves any amazing new direction for the dc universe and is lifted only by the rocks star power
Nov 27 2022,positive,the movie was great
Nov 27 2022,negative,walked out one hour in  0 character development 0 plot development it was as if we were watching the same fight scene for a constant hour i had no idea one hour into the movie why these characters were doing saying what they were doing this movie was apg 13 movie and i watched 2 characters nearly hook up in a scene that made the movie unrecognizable in so many instances it looked as if dwayne johnson was conflicted in saying what he was saying and acting the way he was acting because again it made absolutely no sense whatsoever  i paid 25  2 tickets to see this movie and it was the biggest waste of my money in some time
Nov 27 2022,positive,was cool not to see it twice but entertaining
Nov 27 2022,negative,another the rock movie but this time out of the jungle
Nov 27 2022,positive,we took our eight year old grandson he enjoyed it and we enjoyed it
Nov 27 2022,positive,this was a great movie i loved it so hope they make another one
Nov 27 2022,positive,awesome movie action packed with a great story 1010 will watch it again
Nov 27 2022,positive,i like dwayne johnsons performance
Nov 27 2022,positive,just a lot of fun and much funnier than i expected  another example where critics are just too full of their own opinion the audience score is far more accurate
Nov 27 2022,negative,some terrible editing cuts acting and camera work quite messy flow of story weak intro too fast and too much music movie should have given time to breathe only good things were the cgi and action
Nov 27 2022,negative,predictable droll annoying terrible
Nov 27 2022,positive,the movie was great but i think the rock is a bit overused in action movies great plot twists and i loved the postcredit scene everything was kind of as i had imagined it its definitely a solid 455
Nov 27 2022,positive,movie was great action packed and a big fan of dwayne johnson but the theater is horrible they let people sit wherever they want even though i paid 3 hours in advance for a seat that i didnt get to sit in
Nov 27 2022,negative,zero character depth cheesy side characters with flat jokes throughout either it was the horrific writing or the bad direction but this movie simply doesnt work
Nov 27 2022,positive,i liked all the action and how intense it was
Nov 27 2022,positive,best shiznit in the shiznit
Nov 27 2022,negative,dwayne really let us down on this one the movie is bland and unoriginal
Nov 27 2022,positive,it was fantastic easy to follow story and lots of action was really glad to see brosnon in there too
Nov 27 2022,positive,this is the best movie i have seen all year i loved it the rock is a real bad ass
Nov 27 2022,positive,i had more fun than i had at any recent marvel movie dc might finally have it figured out  things i liked  action  humor  music  the rock clearly loving playing this character while also still just being himself
Nov 27 2022,positive,ok cliche storyline bad cgi
Nov 27 2022,positive,one of dwaynes best performances complimented with a good story and great action sequences
Nov 27 2022,positive,overall was a good movie
Nov 27 2022,negative,as much as i hoped to enjoy this film the honest truth is simply that dwayne johnson lacks the depth of character and willingness to reach that even a role like this needs  i guess it was fine but i would say the film overall was as forgettable as thor the dark world the marvel film that everyone forgot existed
Nov 27 2022,positive,i absolutely loved this movie screw the critics it was fun and the fight scenes were awesome
Nov 27 2022,positive,its really such a fun movie to watch and the fight scene is perfect
Nov 26 2022,negative,i went in with no expectations wanted to give it a clear path my god is this film terrible the rock must have had about 30 words to say just looks moody all the way through it poor dc just struggle making good films maybe james gunn will have more luck with the great potential dc has
Nov 26 2022,positive,the snacks where great and the characters where great it just did not really a plot line
Nov 26 2022,positive,i thought this was incredibly fun film full of action and decent cgi  its never boring although some characters like cyclone and smasher are cheesy and are missing any character development the film never fails to entertain
Nov 26 2022,negative,89 viewer score the dialogue and acting was so so bad the cgi like a video game ott wokery and the bad guys were laughable and oddly absent for a large part of the film  thats a lot of people with very low standards  i had to watch in it two chunks i was getting so bored after an hour
Nov 26 2022,positive,great image good story
Nov 26 2022,positive,not the best movie i saw this year but it was fun i cannot stand the young kid i would love to see this movie recut without his presence
Nov 26 2022,positive,fun the movie is very fun while not every joke may land you will definitely enjoy this dc film this is the kind of dc film you are wanting to be made pierce brosnan and aldis hodge also stole the show with the their incredible performances you will want to see more of them on screen
Nov 26 2022,neutral,the only redeeming factors of this movie are action scenesstale dialogue and a predictable plot that doesnt rap up nicely
Nov 26 2022,positive,i think if youre a kid watching this it might be a lot better as the tagalong skateboarding get it hes cool cos he skateboards kid indicated to me at least that much to this point the story was a bit dumbed down and there was a really confusing set of swipes at more complicated ideas as it goes an ostensiblyforeign invader disrespecting a local culture is ousted in a coup or liberated by a powerful unstoppable force with no qualms with murder en masse  however this force is not overtly misanthropic and thus is an improvement  and leaves a gaping power vacuum in a land that has a history of powerful dictators fin   the action scenes are in that superfast quickcut snyderesq fashion which i personally love but some viewers find nauseating and fairly graphic not quite the level of the boys but a step up from man of steel the cgi is amazing with one laughably bad exception toward the end it seemed like the movie tacked on the last quarter of the movie as it sort of ends threequarters of the way in then the writing and some of the cgi take a nosedive    anyway both my liking of dr fate from the comics and the wellcgied snyderesq fight style made this watchable for me as an adult
Nov 26 2022,positive,it was exiting action packed movie very interesting 
Nov 26 2022,negative,never has a film been as bad as this   no words can describe how awful this is in so many ways

Nov 26 2022,positive,action  10   graphics  65  direction  55    watched it twice and i no like it i think its a great action movie
Nov 26 2022,positive,a cinamatic masterpiece only dave filony could produce this is one of the best perfomances the rock and cg man have gven in a movie yet
Nov 26 2022,positive,masterful acting performance by the dwayne the cock johnson
Nov 26 2022,negative,if i wasnt stoned when i saw this movie in the theater i would give it zero stars it was incredibly boring and the story was bizarre i would not recommend this to anyone who plans to watch it while sober
Nov 26 2022,positive,not bad action was pretty good  editing was jumpy and seemed abrupt in certain shots  some of the acting was weak by a few secondary characters
Nov 26 2022,positive,the movie is good not great not terrible great fight scenes with necessary brutal elements the plot however they tried to put too much eggs in the same bowl and it ended badly
Nov 26 2022,negative,same story line   uncertain superhero doing his usual stuffsaving and destroying thingsuntil a number of other superhumans realise the superhero is a threat choose to submerge him in water after a few minutes  he stands up to kill the supervillain which is boring the highlight is that the supervillain is aware that he will die horribly at the conclusion of the film because the villain may have seen marvel movie the director introduced an idea lets take the villain out of the box and split him in half the end gosh kill mee
Nov 26 2022,positive,awesome loved the movie
Nov 26 2022,negative,i cant believe dwayne johnson and pierce brosnan agreed to do this movie do they need money that badly wish i could find something good to say about it my recommendation is dont waste your time very disappointing
Nov 26 2022,positive,this movie was excellent the story the action amazing
Nov 26 2022,negative,awful bad script badly placed music humour that misses nearly every time bad wire work cheap fx dr fate is great but the rest are poor dc has been floundering for the last 5 years
Nov 26 2022,positive,loved it  the rock was amazing  action from beginning until the end  not much character development with it being so action oriented  but solid movie
Nov 26 2022,positive,i enjoyed the movie and the action was great 
Nov 26 2022,positive,there was a lot of action and some really cool special effects  the story is a little confusing at first then it gets clearer in the end  there were some funny parts not sure if it was supposed to be funny overall not a bad flick
Nov 26 2022,positive,for a dc movie really good
Nov 26 2022,positive,not dc level  it felt like rushed but watchable
Nov 26 2022,negative,a badly made copycat
Nov 26 2022,positive,great movie the critics are jerks as always
Nov 26 2022,positive,great movie and thank god it had no woke bs maybe thats the reason why the rotten tomatoes team gave it a very bad score 
Nov 26 2022,positive,a refreshing movie in this new age of cinema much needed thank you to the rock and thank you dc for releasing this
Nov 26 2022,positive,lots of action but just as much to build off of for future dc movies great movie overall
Nov 26 2022,positive,it was a good movie  basically rock convinced the directors to handle the movie like old school wrestling buildup  building up the fight to come     i think its working and as marvel is currently collapsing  it couldnt come at a better time     now if they can only stay true to souse material and not sht in fans and comics that would be nice looking at you marvel
Nov 26 2022,negative,it was both too fast and too long as well as cheesy and unoriginal ive never been so disappointed after all the hype
Nov 26 2022,negative,its superhero movies such as these with absolutely horrible cgi a generic storyline and the completely wasted talent of notable actors ie pierce brosnan that are a big reason todays hollywood is extremely waterdowned repetitive and highly uncreative the epitome of a film that aims to appeal to a global audience market cheesy af preteens and younger audience members may enjoy as well as foreign audiences who looking for yet another attempt of a superhero box office buster
Nov 26 2022,positive,the movie had great action and characters
Nov 26 2022,positive,once again rotten tomato gets it wrong this is by far the best super hero movie of the year
Nov 26 2022,negative,im so disappointed in this movie i was super excited to see it and now i regret paying money to watch that piece of junk horrible acting and super corny
Nov 26 2022,positive,great film dont listen to these marvel paid to play critics the rock kills it in every movies hes in
Nov 26 2022,positive,the movie is fantastic the rock brosnan and shahi are allsuperb aldis hodge is a bit klunky but effective  the other two heroes are a bit distracting but not in such a manner as to derail the film the villain is a logical adversary to the character and works well good movie the poor reaction from critics is typical theres no lecture in the film so critics are in full tantrum mode good its a kickass film
Nov 26 2022,negative,worst rock movie ever i was very disappointed to see him make such a evil and dare i say satanic film
Nov 26 2022,negative,not nearly enough story dialogue or character development even for a comic book story disappointing
Nov 26 2022,negative,to me it felt like there was no storyline im giving it 2 stars cause of the fight scenes
Nov 26 2022,positive,i dont agree with the critics i went in thinking this was going to be another bad dc movie however my family and i thoroughly enjoyed this
Nov 26 2022,negative,terrible dont waste your time the rock is a one dimensional character in whatever movie hes in and that one character is the rock a horror show terrible script plot acting cgi nothing redeemable here
Nov 26 2022,positive,look people going into these movies expecting a cinematic masterpiece are most likely losers with nothing else to do with their time at the end of the day you watch these sort of things to see good guy beat up bad guy and this movie does it great im not putting 4 and a half because i analyzed this movie put it in some algorithm and spat out a result no im saying that during the watching period of this movie i got a 4 and a half amount of enjoyment
Nov 26 2022,positive,it was good  not outstanding but watchable
Nov 26 2022,negative,it was so so meh they could have done soo much more with this
Nov 26 2022,positive,i actually enjoyed it way more than i anticipated aldis hodge and pierce pierce brosnan were terrific i want to see more of dr fate and hawkman the rock is what sets this movie back hes a terrible actor
Nov 26 2022,positive,its a super hero action film not sure what the critics are looking for exposition come on man the action rocks and the movie has a great pace big sfx and the rock what did the critics think this movie was gonna be  fans love it i dug it and had a good time thats what matters
Nov 26 2022,positive,loved pierce brosnan in the movie and his character  not so much into the skeletons and the word shazam
Nov 26 2022,negative,this movie could have been so awesome like shazam but instead its bleak dull underwhelming the cast is well ok but the characters are dull you dont get attached to them the poor kid who plays atom smasher he is supposed to be a comic relief but he is just annoying the bad guy at the end looks so stupid my god what were they thinking when they made this movie  the only good part of the movie is when adam appears after that its a farce
Nov 26 2022,positive,great visually character development was a bit choppy and rushed
Nov 25 2022,positive,great action movie dwayne johnson was great
Nov 25 2022,negative,story went off and acting was terrible
Nov 25 2022,positive,no doubt dwayne the rock johnson has done superbly to portray the character and save the movie from unwanted characters whos presence is not all required cgi was bad  it could have been a good movie with a good plot overall its a one time watch
Nov 25 2022,negative,zachary levi is better
Nov 25 2022,positive,great superherovigilante movie  lots of action and some suprises with an overall predictable plot
Nov 25 2022,positive,fun action movie but rather erratic storyline
Nov 25 2022,negative,good special effects predictable violence that got boring the rock has little emotional range too much reliance on magic
Nov 25 2022,positive,idk what the critics are on about this is a pretty decent film compared to recent marvel ones which were pretty shi tto be honest it would have been better as an r rated movie but this was pretty decent too doesnt deserve the critics ratings
Nov 25 2022,negative,it was awful  dwayne johnson seems to think his wresting smolder is drama  the dialogue was terrible and the plot was just kindergarten at best  it is sad that he spent that much time trying to get this movie made when it is just a joke
Nov 25 2022,positive,it was violent and funny i truly enjoyed it the affects were awesome and story was really cool some of it was a little over done but overall i would watch it again
Nov 25 2022,positive,this is a very bad movie that everyone should watch
Nov 25 2022,positive,entertained good characters development and good action it achieved my expetations
Nov 25 2022,positive,its the best dc movie i have ever seen and experience but there were some scenes i dont like
Nov 25 2022,negative,the movie was bad acting was bad with characters that were completely useless atom and cyclone cgi was bad with 200 mil i honestly dont know how that was possible when movies with half that budget look better and all in all the story was tired the action only happening in 1 location mostly things didnt make sense and the rock is the worst fake natty he cant even act wtf stop casting him in movies he ruins all of them
Nov 25 2022,positive,it is a good movie dont believe the critics because they are crazy this movie is pretty nice and i recommend it if you want a good movie to watch
Nov 25 2022,positive,i havent enjoyed a superhero movie for so long this movie was awesome get rid of these socalled critics they are useless
Nov 25 2022,negative,just very very bad movie everything is terrible dont waste your money
Nov 25 2022,positive,it was pretty good  cant go wrong with the rock not the best movie i ever saw but still worth the watch
Nov 25 2022,positive,it was good for what it was a good superhero action movie i enjoyed it and so did my kids
Nov 25 2022,positive,action pretty much constant visuals awesome background vague
Nov 25 2022,positive,awesome movie fast pace action critics suck
Nov 25 2022,negative,plot sucked another poor showing for dc so much for the rebirth
Nov 25 2022,positive,its was good  funny
Nov 25 2022,positive,dc delivered awesome story and graphics
Nov 25 2022,positive,its was pretty good entertaining but not wooow
Nov 25 2022,positive,it stumbles on the writing but makes up for it overall
Nov 25 2022,positive,plot was lacking but visuals were spectacular
Nov 25 2022,positive,definitely an adventure loved loved loved every second of it a must see
Nov 25 2022,neutral,it was a lot of great cgi with very little creativity in the storyline
Nov 25 2022,positive,i enjoyed it it was pretty good the story didnt have the usual hero type character and back story
Nov 25 2022,positive,is regular movie effects good
Nov 25 2022,positive,fun movie my kids  11 18  enjoyed it love the play of a more serious story mixed with the usual comic book style teamups it doesnt sound like it would work but it does
Nov 25 2022,positive,amazing just amazing besides some cg moments out of place ofc
Nov 25 2022,positive,it had a great plot with some funny moments however i had no idea where some of the characters came from overall it was a good movie and set the path for a sequel or future dc film
Nov 24 2022,positive,the rock rocksmaybe shallow but he was made for this role
Nov 24 2022,positive,best heroe movie waiting for more
Nov 24 2022,positive,great movie gets going quick and stays going
Nov 24 2022,positive,great movie the plot catches you and holds your attention with a couple of twists and then theres dwayne johnson 
Nov 24 2022,positive,was pretty entertaining not the greatest story but a decent popcorn film
Nov 24 2022,positive,the visuals and flying sequences were absolutely superb just wish it was longer
Nov 24 2022,negative,even for a superhero movie this was exceptionally bad  the dialogue feels like it was written as an 8th grade pre teen boys semester project  which makes sense since youd have to have the judgement of a 12 year old to be impressed by anything this movie has to offer  watch at your own risk this movie will make you dumber
Nov 24 2022,positive,this movie is an actionpacked fun story and a refreshing moment for the superhero film genre this film gives each character a unique feel and the simplicity of the plot works for it dc continues to make their characters feel unique and epic as they slowly rebuild and piece together the foundation for their cinematic universe we have to remember that these films are comic book adaptations not comic books themselves so i dont deduct points for lack of comic book accuracy as the film itself was very enjoyable and has great rewatch value
Nov 24 2022,positive,the fight scenes were incredible
Nov 24 2022,positive,possibly my favourite dccu film to date great action and effects really hope to see more of ba in the near future
Nov 24 2022,negative,this movie had a trainwreck of a plot
Nov 24 2022,positive,decent movie good but not great didnt like the guy playing hawkman but dr fate was great and not a single homosexual reference in the movie to shove down our throats 
Nov 24 2022,positive,probably one of the best superheroes movies ive ever seen
Nov 24 2022,negative,atrocious this and we84 are the worst superhero scripts in the last decade unfortunately this is a watered down black panther it resembles it too much and the script should have been a suicide squad movie to capture a mad black adam dictator this character should not have its own movie it should be s recurring villain that is captured and could be used in the suicide squad the script is very bad and jla are a joke if this movie was to be madeat least this should have been a character mentioned before and be the villain in shazam 3 to make it work at this point the dceu is not fixable btw this should have been a hbo max exclusive not worth watching in theaters
Nov 24 2022,positive,great movie cant wait for part 2
Nov 24 2022,positive,dumb fun superhero movie who dare to take itself pretty serious a perfect alternative to the sillyness and preachyness of the mcu not perfect by any definition but a fun watch
Nov 24 2022,positive,its good to see a move in the genre having fun with its story without having to bash it audience with any messaging other than this is a comic book movie   the cast put their heart and soul into it and it showed look forward to more
Nov 24 2022,positive,dc has officially won me over to their side  no longer do i prefer marvel movies over dc  hello dc goodbye marvel  i have been really enjoying the dc universe its got depth character atmosphere good writers good actors and heart and soul
Nov 24 2022,positive,the movie is very good
Nov 24 2022,negative,im not gonna lie this movie is pretty ass while watching the movie it does have some great fight scenes that is the only positive thing i can say about the movie the movie makes a mockery of already established heros and completely destroys any actual sibilance to some of the heros and their backgrounds biggest one in my opinion being doctor fate and nabu completely rehashing and changing the character the acting from some of the characters such as amon the present child in the movie is so unacceptable for such a big film im aware that my opinion will not change the super hero hive mind of fans but at least this little score ticking down from this brings solace to the 2 hours of my life wasted at another rehashed super hero movie
Nov 24 2022,positive,i loved the movie it had action and comedy and it made the time fly because it was so good
Nov 24 2022,positive,entertaining last scenes with the kid and street civilians from fighting were horrible and unnecessary but good overall
Nov 24 2022,negative,not very good character development is extremely poor story meanders without explaining much about which superheroes got which powers and the souce  black adam just seems to be some invincible guy and like what are his powers everything     not very good
Nov 24 2022,positive,for those that like lots of very fast action and loud movie they would probably have 5   i just got a little confused which people were fighting which group
Nov 24 2022,positive,a new start for dc hope they continue the momentum
Nov 24 2022,positive,great movie fresh to see a super hero really lay the smack down the whole heroes dont kill vibe always feels to pure and high and mighty a hero who does whatever it takes
Nov 24 2022,positive,better then any other dc movie since christopher nolans batman trilogy
Nov 24 2022,positive,once again rotten tomatoes gets it wrong it is a good movie with good action and a great plot by no means is it perfectbut name a superhero movie that is worth the watch hackman is a dick
Nov 24 2022,positive,it had everything a super hero movie should have action from start to finish  great special effects and a cliffhanger ending that makes you want more i really enjoyed seeing pierce brosnan in a movie
Nov 24 2022,positive,entertaining with good cgi just what if it had less fighting scenes and instead there was more storytelling about his past
Nov 24 2022,positive,finally a superhero movie that had action the whole way through i understand that the canon was not exactly correct but it was fun to watch i would 100 recommend seeing it
Nov 24 2022,positive,wife and i enjoyed the movie loved to see some of the less popular dc characters they were great on screen
Nov 24 2022,positive,the rocks charisma was the only thing keeping my attention and holding this thing together even that seemed to be watered down the story line was weak and transparent im guessing better context was left on the cutting room floor  good for mindless action but watch it without expectation
Nov 24 2022,negative,3 writers and 14 years in production you would think more time would make the writing better but this was just the old superhero plot that died in the 80s and fight after fight bs no drama no suspense no mystery and no real fun decent acting and special effects next time hire one decent writerdirector to fulfill their vision
Nov 23 2022,negative,the casting for amon is a complete mismatch its not the acting but hes simply too old for the script age appropriate cast amon and it wouldve been a solid 3 for a hungover movie
Nov 23 2022,neutral,the action was great cgi was way to shotty from a triple a film imo the story was ok but th3 dialog is just awful and there are too many terrible scenes in this movie
Nov 23 2022,negative,totally overrated weightless and with a rather poor plot lousy performances lousy script and a cgi horrifying the only defensible thing is the soundtrack
Nov 23 2022,positive,cool for the action thats about it the rock dumbed himself down to play this character but optimistic for whats to comeif anything from this movie 
Nov 23 2022,positive,a solid 5 star for a fantasy film that was well written produced and acted throughout suspension of disbelief the whole way through encapsulating me for the entire movie well worth it for marvel fans
Nov 23 2022,positive,its a great movie the rock is a natural
Nov 23 2022,negative,more woke bs when will they stop this
Nov 23 2022,positive,i had fun with this film i even found myself able to get past the stars acting for this character onenote was applicable
Nov 23 2022,negative,some of the worst writing and characters that i have seen in a long time
Nov 23 2022,negative,two hours of cgi fight scenes just couldnt make up for the lack in plot depth introducing multiple new characters was bound to fail due to the lack of character introduction and development black adam spent a decade in the making yet fell flat on its face
Nov 23 2022,positive,a pretty good action movie i can see dc universe competing with mcu from now on properly
Nov 23 2022,negative,what a stinker the rock made a stinky and made us pay for it it a big o stinky movie
Nov 23 2022,positive,been awhile since ive enjoyed a sup flick and adam was most def dope from start to finish   no joke thought i wasnt gunna like it but i was completely entertained most def dc uni comin strong
Nov 23 2022,positive,the movie is really good cuz its the rock
Nov 23 2022,positive,was an okay movie i wish id have waited until it was on netflix 
Nov 23 2022,neutral,basic followed a typical story line nothing too exciting the rock is a good actor
Nov 23 2022,positive,it was a decent movie the last 20 minutes was better than the rest the story was somewhat novel for a superhero movie it was a good action movie but just wasnt the best i wouldnt ay it was a waste of a 10 movie ticket though the acting directing digital effects were all amazing
Nov 23 2022,positive,looks like there is a lot of outoftouch critics out there i agree with the audience great movie
Nov 23 2022,positive,actually enjoyed the movie better than i thought it would be wish we saw it on the big screen
Nov 23 2022,negative,honestly for cinemark which it is a beautiful building and beautiful service of people talking care of you behind the counter once you get to your auditorium and you sit personally the seats are very uncomfortable and the 2 other guest that i took with me also said the same thing to point that we left in the middle of the movie because i had such a headache and they kept complaining about the seats
Nov 23 2022,negative,it was a ok movie 
Nov 23 2022,positive,this wouldve been great in 2010 great 5 tuesday movie
Nov 23 2022,negative,a directionless mess of fantastical scenes mashed into a plotless movie most characters lacked any substance or character other than adam script was embarrassingly bad to boot
Nov 23 2022,positive,beyond even my expectations  highly recommend seeing it  make sure you watch past the credits
Nov 23 2022,positive,really enjoyed this one it seems to pave the way for other dc movies that have potential funny how the critics say this movie is bad yet the audience says otherwise im sure these critics are the ones that bash twitter after elons takeover take what they say with a grain of salt
Nov 23 2022,positive,enjoyed the movie a little convenient with the ending and the editing could have been better dwayne johnson  was great and the other super heroes were good casting
Nov 23 2022,positive,not terrible not great right down the middle of the road where its ok promises a better direction for the dc universe going forwardif you know you know
Nov 23 2022,negative,it had some beautiful special effects but the story and plot fell flat
Nov 23 2022,positive,great action and a great set up for whats to come
Nov 23 2022,positive,and yet another movie that the critics criticism fails to reflect the audiences experience i wonder if they actually watched the movie or are they just out of touch with audience expectations i use to respect rotten tomatoes critics ratings but lately they seem to be lacking in revelance
Nov 23 2022,positive,loved it different view of dwayne a little confused about the dc universe part
Nov 23 2022,positive,it was a little inconsistent  i dont really know the point of two characters  must all comic movies have the stereotypical goofy kid and knockoff storm  those felt wedged in to add comedy  spice that never happened  the core of the story was pretty good  but it could have been a solid 45 minutes shorter or used the time to add some depth to the characters  result  sure id like to see this cross over with the first shazaam crew
Nov 23 2022,positive,good story good action what more could you want
Nov 23 2022,positive, an entertaining movie that makes you wonder what movie the critics saw its one of those movies that you dont expect much from due to the bad reviews it isnt high on story but it is still a ton of fun
Nov 23 2022,negative,generic as they come the rock playing the rock
Nov 22 2022,positive,if youre looking for the depth of hamlet look somewhere else  if youre looking for a comic book you can open read be entertained quickly have your favorite character and then root for them then this is it   loved they brought it lesser known heroes like hawkman and dr fate and made them rock     disclaimer i would have given this just 4 stars but its obnoxious the critics have something against dc while praising marvel
Nov 22 2022,positive,amazing cgi and great ending
Nov 22 2022,neutral,greatly disappointing
Nov 22 2022,positive,awesom es muy recomendable

Nov 22 2022,negative,hands down the worst dc movie to date fire jaume colletserra for the next one please
Nov 22 2022,positive,i went into this with very low expectations as dc has continued to disappoint over the years i was pleasantly surprised i thought after the first 30 minutes wow this is better than i thought and that was just the beginning as it kept getting better and better great movie and now excited for the future of dc
Nov 22 2022,positive,great action just some good old fashion fun
Nov 22 2022,positive,saw it last night and really enjoyed it
Nov 22 2022,negative,not that good in my opinionthere should have been bad language to make the movie bettermarvel is better than dc

Nov 21 2022,positive,the action was topnotch the word building spectacular and the story well crafted would have been better if they gave atom smasher a more significant role in the plot
Nov 21 2022,positive,really amazing 
Nov 21 2022,neutral,the story was lacking and overall it was a bit boring for an action movie
Nov 21 2022,positive,balls to the wall action from beginning to end bloody marvellous
Nov 21 2022,positive,the movie was awesome dont think about the reviews as a origin movie it was good the action scenes were well done and the plot was also amazing

Nov 21 2022,positive,loved it expecting more but i loved it
Nov 21 2022,negative,awesome effects but the whole movie felt awkward like if they had removed some parts just like how it felt with the first version of the justice league movie and it was one of the cringiest movies ive ever seen
Nov 21 2022,negative,weak storyline bad acting 2 hours of my life i will never get back

Nov 21 2022,positive,not a bad movie they casted a great actor only complaint for me would it was really long however theres a surprise at the end you need to see after the credits
Nov 21 2022,positive,idk what the critics thought they were going to see  movie was great though not the best ive seen but much better than a few recent titles
Nov 21 2022,positive,strong story line semicringe direction on acting and lines trying too hard to force comedy villain ended too quickly had stronger potential truly
Nov 21 2022,positive,i enjoyed  pace of the movie  the two story lines   the action  the humor  movie effects
Nov 21 2022,positive,amazing its like marvel with john wick with the matrix combined thank you
Nov 21 2022,positive,the action is phenomenal i wish marvel would stick to this instead of all the comedy i loved everything in the movie but i do wish they either expanded on the 2 sidekick superheros or rather just not have them in the movie altogether otherwise great movie

Nov 20 2022,positive,great movie dwayne kills it as always
Nov 20 2022,neutral,a perfectly talented cast but the screenplay wasnt up to snuff it felt like a bunch of the best themes from various superhero movies were thrown into a blender then thrown against a wall to see what sticks the cast deserved better
Nov 20 2022,positive,i like that it was a story about sacrifice between a father and son
Nov 20 2022,negative,a bad film couldnt make it past 30 minutes cinematography photography cgi were good but the storyline is designed for preteenagers basic boring not worth any time spent on it

Nov 20 2022,negative,its not so good as a standalone movie   hard to follow for people with little to no knowledge of the characters  the action lacked sufficient sound effects but was ok  nonprotagonist characters introduction was terrible  too much background music
Nov 20 2022,positive,i thought it had a lot of good action and would see it again
Nov 20 2022,positive,i think the only reason i didnt enjoy it more was because of the superhero fatigue everyone is feeling at the moment however other than that small point i still found this film to be very entertaining while still keeping to the superhero film formula the action was incredible and the visual effects were out of this world which is great to see after what marvel has been putting out lately good to see dc films beat the disney machine at something all in all i would definitely recommend going to watch this with some friends
Nov 20 2022,positive,watched it today it was great if you like action movies watch it now

Nov 20 2022,neutral,hawkman was so corny
Nov 20 2022,neutral,i walked into the theater expecting a mediocre film and i walked out feeling like i received what i expected the story begins with an okay structure but by the end youre asking yourself what is even going on anymore the story has a lot of action and too much of anything isnt always good the villain at the end was weak and the film isnt a strong one overall
Nov 20 2022,positive,love everything the rock is in good sound effects and action

Nov 20 2022,negative,pretty formula and nothing memorable about it decent effects

Nov 20 2022,positive,i thought this movie was so entertaining dwayne did a great job and you can tell he is very committed to the role and the future of the dceu brosnan as dr fate was an incredible casting he was brilliant and had me glued to the screen i loved the fast pace action and visual effects i think a lot of people want this movie to fail solely because its the rock and they are haters 
Nov 20 2022,positive,enjoyable movie nothing crazy a good superhero flick but nothing to write home about
Nov 20 2022,positive,good action packed movie following the dc comics tradition must see make sure you watch the credits at the end to see a surprise
Nov 20 2022,positive,ridiculous plot trying to knock of the marvel universe using little known or newly made up heros action was decent

Nov 20 2022,negative,it was boring and nonsensical
Nov 20 2022,positive,it was a excellent movie
Nov 20 2022,positive,as usual the so called critics get it wrong but what else is new thats how we know when a movie is good the paper critics give low scores the audience give it a high score this movie was brilliant best super hero movie in a while
Nov 20 2022,positive,enjoyable comic book fun
Nov 20 2022,positive,full of action and a great story lead 5 out of 5 dc is finally jumping onward
Nov 19 2022,positive,it was a super hero movie pretty entertaining the rock was awesome
Nov 19 2022,positive,dc got this movie right
Nov 19 2022,negative,the movie was great but then there was technical difficulties and the movie kept going in slow motion at the end skipping and then it didnt even show the part after the credits it skipped back to the middle of the movie so it was very very this pleasing
Nov 19 2022,positive,its a comic book w a good comic book plot relax haters
Nov 19 2022,positive,great special affects
Nov 19 2022,positive,very very enjoyable and entertaining by all the dc movie this is what i prefered
Nov 19 2022,positive,harsh critique seem somewhat unwarranted the film seems to be bouncing off some mcu ideas which is never a bad thing probably dcu best film to date besides the snydercut its brought some hope that dcu may find its path after all
Nov 19 2022,neutral,a bit overdone plot was on the weaker side of average character development was scarce not marvel worthy
Nov 19 2022,positive,we enjoyed the whole movie
Nov 19 2022,positive,personally i thought it was great summer blockbuster fare full of fun fantasy and action so im not entirely sure what the so called expert critics were expecting to see to cast an overly intellectual critical eye over a superhero movie seems to be a tad naive what exactly were they hoping to see relax guys switch off for a couple of hours and suspend your disbelief because macbeth or great expectations these movies are not
Nov 19 2022,positive,great movie lots of action 
Nov 19 2022,positive,i loved the rockand aldous and the henry cameo and i loved the uncle
Nov 19 2022,positive,really good plot and action scenes
Nov 19 2022,negative,league of fools this flick is rightfully been shredded to about 40  but this is not yet low enough oh boy unsurprising but repeatedly unsettling about the majority of american superheros is their blatant inability to think or develop some sort of strategy the repeated credo here a bad plan is better than no plan is that so  probably part of the brainwash packet that comes with such movies dont get me started on any details everything was just so outlandishly crafted together that i sincerely hope no extraterrestrial being would ever get to know our race produced such a crapola if you read this  dont watch
Nov 19 2022,positive,i fell asleep watching this and woke up in the cinema a little embarrassed as my son and his friend both 13 had left halfway through    i met them outside watching youtubeyoutube      this is not a good movie
Nov 19 2022,positive,we thought it was a good love the humor
Nov 19 2022,positive,i loved this movie sure they race swapped a few characters but the actors did a great job at it so im ok with it
Nov 19 2022,positive,absolutely fantastic movie from the fighting and the music to the story line if your not a marvel comic fan you will be after this
Nov 19 2022,positive,not as dark as alot of dc movies but not as light as say shazam good music in fitting places movie doesnt take a fan to follow but as a fan only thing annoying is how often they take their helmets off thats why its not getting 5 starts
Nov 19 2022,negative,terribly bland with badly written characters bad dialogue too much meaningless action and did i mention fight scenes zero depth or engagement tue cgi also looked cheap and like it was made 1015 years ago the villain also was a joke i like the rock but this movie is terrible
Nov 19 2022,positive,finally a movie that has an antihero with a good backstory and makes a good foil to the other heroes including shazam dwayne johnson is and always has been quite a powerhouse in real life whether he is a hero or not so good job to him and the rest of the cast for bringing some action packed dramatic comedy loving dc comic movie to the big screen
Nov 19 2022,negative,terrible script story and even more horrid acting by everyone except dwayne really  was this intended for children in grade 2  what a joke
Nov 19 2022,positive,it was fun and awsome movie people who does not like the movie is just lazy
Nov 19 2022,negative,generic catchphrases with robotic performances and a terrible soundtrack despite that the movie is a good time pass
Nov 19 2022,positive,slow mo scenes were great
Nov 19 2022,negative,this movie made absolutely no sense at all half the movie was just the rock killing people they spent like 30 minutes explaining teth adams backstory but none of the other characters were given backstories then somehow they summoned satan idk but i wouldnt really recommend this movie its a waste of time and money
Nov 19 2022,positive,i absolutely loved it it was so awesome i didnt think the film would be good based on its rotten tomatoes score because rotten tomatoes is often spot on with their movie critiques but this time they got it wrong this movie is hands down one of the best dc comics movies if not the best and it is now one of my top favorite superhero movies
Nov 19 2022,positive,an entertaining watch
Nov 19 2022,positive,i was thoroughly entertained by the movie there was just a lot of action fight sequences etc  it did not make an attempt to move me or push a message it was just there to entertain and i appreciated it  i know some will knock the movie but they tend to knock everything johnson is in this movie more than meets the expectations for the type of movie it is
Nov 19 2022,positive,kinda slow at the start but it was only a little bit but then jumped straight into action and stayed in action great movie
Nov 19 2022,positive,i loved so much i was very emotional during the whole movie
Nov 19 2022,negative,really bad watched the first 50 minutes and had to quit it
Nov 18 2022,positive,im a big fan of the rock but that aside dc has over the years managed to obtain a fairly bad rap  i absolutely loved this movie  sorry not sorry its entertaining visually appealing  action packed the cast were flawless and it was just a brilliant allrounder  if i had to criticise anything it probably would be the girl spinning around with colours floating around her  not sure what the point of her character was but whatever lol
Nov 18 2022,positive,best movie of the year hands down
Nov 18 2022,negative,some good parts very corny
Nov 18 2022,negative,its completly disappointment it is not deserving even half star the vfx has been used like 2005s vfx apologise for the who knows beter vfx stuff i dont even talk about the acting the zombies were acting betersorry the rock but you have beter movies
Nov 18 2022,positive,one of the best stand alone super hero movies ive seen so far they should do a part two
Nov 18 2022,positive,plenty of actionnot impressed with the two young super heroes
Nov 18 2022,negative,wow that was bad did a 6 year old write this all these years the rock waited and this is what the end product was i should have waited till it came out on amazon prime
Nov 18 2022,positive,dc has done the unthinkable with this movie 2hrs passed without me noticing thats how amazing this movie is amazing
Nov 18 2022,positive,if you are looking for a movie with tons of action this is it its the one story isnt the greatest but the action makes up more then enough for it go watch this movie to have a blast dont miss out on this unless you have a theater in your house absolute must see action non stop movie    that is my review
Nov 18 2022,negative,dc what exactly were you trying to do here gosh i dont know even where to begin the storyline was sht the actors jesus dont get me started on that   there were only two good things in this movie          1 dwayne johnson          2 cgi was on point      410
Nov 18 2022,positive,probably the best superhero movie ive ever seen  because of the instant justice that he delivers to the bad guys
Nov 18 2022,positive,has a great action consistent story from start to end
Nov 18 2022,positive,very good storyline contributed to each key characters properly a lot of investmey in continuous action scenes cg is not perfect but good enough love doctor fate character looking forward to the black adam chapter 2 with shazam or sequel of justice society
Nov 18 2022,positive,honestly some amazing animation
Nov 18 2022,positive,fantastic movie the rock did a great job thoroughly pleased
Nov 18 2022,positive,the movie was great up until the very last 30 minutes it had great action but got very demonic i was not a fan of how demonic it became
Nov 18 2022,positive,not a bad movie   worth watching on a lazy sunday 4 sure  no where near as bad as what the critics say anyway
Nov 18 2022,positive,good not great cheesy at moments but entertaining throughout 
Nov 18 2022,positive,a lot of cool action but the story aswell as its logic is not the best
Nov 18 2022,positive,one of the best to come out since the avengers killed thanos 
Nov 18 2022,positive,absolutely loved this great take on the jsa enjoyed the backstory and it didnt dwell so we could move forward interesting to have some focus on the middle east great effects the cameo was the cherry on top
Nov 18 2022,neutral,truly a mid movie the random ensemble of characters dont have any weight or emotion attached unless you are familiar with the comic counterparts even after which characters like atom are just a let down on the bright side movie does offer some witty and cool action 1 for setting exciting prospects for dcu
Nov 18 2022,neutral,very mid plot  needed to be half the length more action better cgi and not as much plots since they obviously didnt try or care
Nov 18 2022,positive,action from the moment the movie started until the end dope special effects pretty cool story line
Nov 18 2022,neutral,devoid of any humor and not batmandark it falls in that whatever category of generic secondary superhero popcorn movie on rainy wednesday night when the other option is an horror flick or a romantic comedy
Nov 18 2022,positive,full of action dark hero amazing cinema effects  definitely a new chapter for dc i hope they build on it
Nov 18 2022,negative,yeah the special fx are awesome however amon the kids acting is aaagh not so good hawkman needs improvements with his acting as well   story is totally rubbish i hope there was an element of surprise in the teaser part where superman showed up like what mcu is doing  sorry i did not enjoy watching this
Nov 18 2022,positive,this movie was amazing id rate it 10 out if 10  the costumes visuals everything was just perfect i liked dr fate a lot
Nov 18 2022,positive,actually surprisingly decent
Nov 18 2022,positive,well cast main characters and steady action support this film but the muddied plot needless side characters and the lame pg13 rating kept this movie from being the surprise hit it could have been
Nov 18 2022,positive,a nonstop fun action movie and its rewatchable
Nov 18 2022,negative,long and boring fell asleep last part of movie
Nov 18 2022,positive,good movie in general but with bad and boring moments that take the awesomeness away 
Nov 18 2022,positive,the dc stigma is only reason people crushing it wasnt bad at all
Nov 18 2022,positive,love all the action of this film
Nov 18 2022,positive,movie was amazing full on action just how a superhero movie should be if youre looking for a slow movie watch a love movie as always i never trust rotten tomatoes reviews as they are a bunch of fools watch the movie yourself and you wont be disappointed
Nov 18 2022,positive,its the rock that is all 
Nov 18 2022,positive,is better than thor love and thunder

Nov 17 2022,positive,finally get to see dr fate on the big screen and he was awesome pleasantly surprised by hawkmans performance as well very excited for the future of dc
Nov 17 2022,positive,better than expected worse than expected virtually no character development lazy initial backstory development required amount of cuteclever dialogue lines but with lessthanrequired setups or justification oddly dark visuals even in broad daylight scenes overthetop cgi convenient moral positioning nodded off a bit 23 of the way through absolutely zero surprises after that point other than that though loved it not
Nov 17 2022,positive,lots of action good show and worth watching  kind of wish it would have gone in a better direction
Nov 17 2022,positive,enjoyed the action and storyline
Nov 17 2022,positive,wow this was an action packed movie  my first marvel movie i am hooked
Nov 17 2022,positive,i love this movies  every aspect of the movie is exciting   but we can do more and keep pushing 
Nov 17 2022,positive,probably better than most dc superhero movies it introduces an antihero to the mix with some relatableredeemable qualities the formula is more or less the same though as any other similar film and the cgi is pretty bad for todays standards i felt the rock felt awkward in the role at times and solid at others hit  miss
Nov 17 2022,positive,it had everything u would expect in a movie we laughed cried gasped and felt warm hope theres  a sequel in the works
Nov 17 2022,negative,seriously  struggled to stay awake  bad acting bad cgi  i was just like nooooo this cant be a super hero movie   14 through i could not watch it any longer
Nov 17 2022,negative,cheesy story great effects but theres no deeper thought behind it  i love the rock and he was a great in the role but the movie lacked substance wit and it was quite a disappointment imo
Nov 17 2022,positive,this movie had everything that makes it a great movie lots of blowing up of things and great special effects lol
Nov 17 2022,positive,honestly a step in the right direction for dc super excited to see these great comic behemoths getting some traction hard to be emotionally moved moved by fresh faces but very well done and the iconic moments do outweigh the cringe very well done 
Nov 17 2022,positive,great movie and the postcredit scenewow
Nov 17 2022,positive,this movie has action from beginning to end a good character introduction with a good story beautiful scenes wonderful cgi effects i cant understand how people didnt like it
Nov 17 2022,positive,i think it was a great movie really an advance for the dceu movie lines and a great continuation since henry cavills return as superman my only critic are some fight scenes that were visible to see the green screen effects and when the demon crown summons the dead was kinda dumb but without that awesome and amazing movie
Nov 17 2022,positive,excellent action movie the rock made this movie much better than any he has made in years excellent movie
Nov 17 2022,positive,i just finished watching it was amazing and the end credit scene oh boy what a surprise superman is back  cant wait for the justice league
Nov 17 2022,positive,i really enjoyed the movie the script is not the best but over all is a good action film way better that what we are seeing in our current day good cgi and overall good characters but a better world building would be really good
Nov 17 2022,positive,sadly my enthusiasm for the movie was heavily overshadowed by all the satanicdark symbols words and message
Nov 17 2022,positive,watch it as a standalone movie and its a great action movie nom stop action very little chatter good cgi
Nov 17 2022,negative,great fight scene what a stupid script so dumb make me laugh
Nov 17 2022,positive,fresh actionpacked
Nov 17 2022,positive,cool characters but poor dialogue and plot
Nov 17 2022,negative,i am a big fan of the rock however this film at its best just passed the time unfortunately i felt a lack of empathy for any of the characters among a lack of understanding why they are actually in the movie in the first place     sorry but not worth my money for the tickets unfortunately
Nov 17 2022,positive,the beat movieee eveeerrrr
Nov 17 2022,positive,recliner seats to veiw an outstanding movie
Nov 17 2022,positive,what a great movie  well done to dc and the rock im a marvel fan though n through but that was amazing
Nov 17 2022,positive,it was really good im going to watch this one many times cant wait for the sequel
Nov 17 2022,positive,i loved it it is a movie with a lot of personality and a great performance of the cgi it is here where we see how special effects are used appropriately in addition to having a great cast and a great story
Nov 17 2022,positive,the rock really did it
Nov 17 2022,positive,keep in mind if this filthy woke generation of critics hated it then its a good movie  is time to create a site where audience the people give a score to the critics lets see if this useless woke generation of critics will survive or go down
Nov 17 2022,negative,waste of the rocks great personality and charisma
Nov 17 2022,positive,i thought it was an excellent superhero movie the story wasnt boring i liked the way the mixed adams story with his kids story that was very diferent well done    i only wished they could of explain more of the other characters maybe shown more of dc fate and hawkman
Nov 17 2022,positive,such an amazing and fun movie must watch
Nov 16 2022,positive,the whole movie was great no cheesy on liners funny when it should have been lots of action i loved it
Nov 16 2022,positive,it did justice to the comic character that i love also it got the antihero balance just right this is a good style for a big action superhero film what snyder meant but couldnt achieve its great seeing dc move forward 4 stars on the superhero movie scale
Nov 16 2022,positive,exactly what you expect dumb fun with good visuals anyone expecting a story telling masterpiece needs to just get real you go to the theatre to see big explosions and hear great sound good stories are just as good on a small screen if you want a fun time go watch it
Nov 16 2022,positive,loves the story line the action scenes were relatively balanced blah blah it was a great movie ok
Nov 16 2022,positive,loved it a different spin on a superhero the rock and cast rock cant wait to see what they do next
Nov 16 2022,positive,entertaining movie always difficult to portray an industructible protagonist weakness the historical origin story needed to be less or more  didnt empathize enough with characters
Nov 16 2022,neutral,what a mess totally predictable void of any emotion nor a good plot another mediocre offering from dc
Nov 16 2022,positive,origin story was great  fate was great  hawk man was great     atom man and wind girl was meh      great job   action scenes   rocks
Nov 16 2022,positive,its about drive its about power zoa 30 off on amazon for the next few hours
Nov 16 2022,positive,this is really different from what weve seen in movies lately it is freshing to see such amazing scenes as dc always did it is a mustwatch i just hope that theyd remove hamada from dc forever
Nov 16 2022,positive,absolute phenomenal such a fun movie to watch excited for more
Nov 16 2022,positive,best movie with some funny humor in it
Nov 16 2022,positive,great movie with enjoyable action just the right amount of story and background to keep the movie flowing and not complicating it so as to create plot holes or loss story emersion great characters and loved to see pierce brosnans great acting as a superhero just the right amount of comedy
Nov 16 2022,positive,great movie and love the action
Nov 16 2022,positive,it was a good super hero movie not the best but it gets a 5 star rating from me because its the best one i have watched  this entire year so far worth a watch
Nov 16 2022,positive,loved that its not woke like other clown superhero movies this year also superman is back
Nov 16 2022,negative,typical over blown cgi mess that ive seen countless times be it dc or marvel these movies are just paint by numbers at this point little to zero orginal character development supposedly were meant to forgive that and be wowed by the lacklustre cgi effects and settings i like dwyane johnson and i love a good blockbuster but this was just painfully generic and safe like a statement from human resources
Nov 16 2022,positive,it was awesome i was screaming as hell i had one of the best experiences some moments were cringe but other than that it was awesome
Nov 16 2022,negative,nothing new nothing creative same ol typical superhero movie that youve seen 1000 times
Nov 16 2022,positive,loved it action humor great effects
Nov 16 2022,positive,great action but thats about it

Nov 16 2022,neutral,better than most dc movies but still needs a lot of help average movie at best
Nov 16 2022,positive,great action movie really funny and quality actors we highly recommend watching this
Nov 16 2022,positive,movie was awesome and story made sense
Nov 16 2022,positive,best dc comics movie ever  funny without overdoing it  more action than i was expecting and it looked great  backup charactersheroes nailed it  just enough backstory and exposition to make it understandable  brosnan as dr fate gave the flick a certain gravitas that hinted at greatness and adventures gone by  i wasnt preoccupied with reconciling a world with a justice society and a justice league  thats how well this stood on its own  the violence both implied and explicit seemed right for the character redeemed by calling out murder when it happens  the collateral damage was another matter but was something lacking in so many comics and comic book movies  that is folks are gonna get killed during these melees  portray it and acknowledge it  skip the fbombs and gore and its still accessible to a wide audience  well done dc
Nov 16 2022,positive,great action packed movie
Nov 16 2022,positive,much better than what ive heard great acting from everyone definitely not an amazing movie but much better than the stuff marvel has been putting out
Nov 16 2022,positive,a solid superhero movie its nice to see a superhero movie that is of a more serious tone
Nov 16 2022,neutral,structured so poorly that it felt like a trailer for the remaining 30 minutes of the movie
Nov 16 2022,positive,finally dc is back 1010
Nov 16 2022,negative,terrible cheap special effects  lousy photography i was embarassed for dwayne
Nov 16 2022,positive,a fresh new start for dc superheroes

Nov 16 2022,positive,great story with fantastic special effects perfect casting
Nov 16 2022,positive,great action great story glad dwayne johnson made this move to the world of super heroes
Nov 16 2022,positive,best movie for super hero genre in long time
Nov 16 2022,positive,the past few dc movies havent been that good then i watched this and i was pleasantly surprised its basically 1 big fight scene with some talking in between
Nov 16 2022,positive,action from start to finish
Nov 15 2022,positive,step in the right direction for dceu still had some pacing and writing issues

Nov 14 2022,negative,so stupid beyond stupid this is parody of superhero movie
Nov 14 2022,positive,this movie was great no complaints just wishing the tone was darker love all dc movies even aquaman that had a very disney tone but this movie had the correct amount of comedy and dc lore
Nov 14 2022,positive,best movie ever riveting experience
Nov 14 2022,positive,good movie the rock did an excellent job playing the lead character and credit goes out to pierce brosnan in the role of dr fate the acting special effects and action was excellent the story could had been better a little too simplistic but the actors made it work i recommend it

Nov 14 2022,positive,i honestly went in thinking it wouldnt be all that  i mean i love the rock but i can do without his acting sometimes  but i loved this movie  usually dc movies arent my thing but this movie was such a banger   straight to the point with the action  the rock really played this part  his demeanor everything  the comedy was there as well  all together just a really good movie 
Nov 14 2022,positive,good story and acting corny in some scenes
Nov 14 2022,negative,the movie was mid lets be honest beside the fight scenes
Nov 14 2022,positive,among top tier superhero movie of 2022 a superhero movie about superhero  keep it up dc be better then that so called marvelous brand
Nov 14 2022,positive,not the best dc super hero movie to date and certainly not the worst a good story  with plenty of action and no pc content no wonder the professional reviewers by and large hated it then again theyre the same clowns who enthusiastically endorsed the hindenburg disaster known as the power of the rings so no one with a brain in their head takes them seriously anymore
Nov 14 2022,positive,it was a really awesome movie
Nov 14 2022,positive,the storyline wasnt the best but it was entertaining from beginning to end
Nov 14 2022,negative,i dont understand what they were doing with the movie its a weak plot with a good portion of it being concepts taken from the broader dc universe like the justice league or from the mcu multiverse the rock isnt compelling and relies on snappy one liners and it feels like an indiana jones meets dc but then getting the worst of both worlds
Nov 14 2022,neutral,nice cgi but the movie is very cheesy
Nov 14 2022,positive,great action movie with a great story line
Nov 14 2022,positive,the best dc movie so far and the performance of dwayne johnson excellent

Nov 14 2022,positive,it was a really good ride   had a lot of fun and it was on my mind when i left the movie as to what is next   wb please keep it coming  finally for this year just a plain good super hero movie with out all the  other stuff  the dialogue is not the greatest though  i dont understand why it seems the same lines seem to be in so many movies  please give more thought to the character development and script dialog  also some of the focus of the characters shifted to quickly away from what seemed important to them to what the plot needed  not cool  characters and their motivations need to be consistent  thank you dawne johnson for what you are bringing to the super hero genre   anticipating a lot more
Nov 14 2022,positive,the rock did his thang in this one love every scene he was in the best part is when he met superman that was everything
Nov 14 2022,positive,great movie one of the best dc universe movies ever
Nov 14 2022,positive,loved it plenty of action the story was crisp and concise and the acting was good this is how dc needs to get things in order ive never understood how dc does an amazing job with their animated film universe yet live action is so hit and miss
Nov 14 2022,negative,its one of the better dceu movies but its still not that good

Nov 14 2022,positive,superb it was obvious that dwayne johnson was having a great time introducing us to a fantastic antihero pierce brosnan quintessa swindell and aldis hodge all turned in good performances as well fun plot twists made this a terrific fall superhero adventure a worthy addition to my list of favorite dc films
Nov 14 2022,positive,so good must watch again
Nov 14 2022,negative,this movie was so hard to follow  lot of pointless action  we usually love all dwayne johnson movies  having pierce brosnan was also a plus  but both of them are totally wasted in this lackluster movie we got bored and left the theater after about an hour
Nov 14 2022,positive,a great comic book superhero movie  needed better dialogue though and more time for the main character and the jsa and less with secondary characters that werent really needed in the movie
Nov 14 2022,positive,awesome movie excellent job by dwayne johnson
Nov 14 2022,positive,i thout that like most dc movies the backstory was a bit rushed but all in all the movie had a good mix of action and humor

Nov 13 2022,negative,this is absurdly cheesy nonsense  if youre 11 years old and just want to watch mindless people flying around and fighting each other with no plot then this is for you
Nov 13 2022,positive,surprisingly not bad 
Nov 13 2022,positive,he had some good in him after all  dwayne johnson is making pretty good movies  i liked him in the jumanji next levels and this one plus jungle cruise and the tooth fairy

Nov 13 2022,positive,great movie  things are looking good for dc     the rock if phenomenal and great supporting cast also  gotta love pierce
Nov 13 2022,positive,good hero outing or should i say antihero  nice intro to the justice society and filled with fun moments to offset the dark stuff  dwayne johnson was great along with all the supporting cast
Nov 13 2022,positive,very entertaining great story and good action
Nov 13 2022,negative,nothing but disconnected special effects
Nov 13 2022,positive,action from starting 
Nov 13 2022,positive,no words just amazing
Nov 13 2022,positive,a great balance of action plot and humour to keep you entertained from start to finish
Nov 13 2022,positive,spoilers ahead      this was amazing the visual effects in this film are incredible and the action was amazing it felt like i was watching a different shazam amon felt like a recast of freddy from shazam but still an amazing film
Nov 13 2022,positive,its a good movie but the first part looks just like a videogame there are ragdolls npcs and people just aiming with their guns wherever they look  the story is pretty good though
Nov 13 2022,positive,lots of action  dark enough to feel closer to snyder verse and not too gimmickyclownlike like other wb dc franchises  after credit scene is a nice tease for more dc movies to be back on track
Nov 13 2022,positive,this film about the great antihero was fun and much more entertaining than expected pierce brosnan and aldis hodge gave great performances for drfate and hawkman which makes me more excited for the dcus future plans for their characters the visuals were outstanding considering the abundance of superhero films and shows that have recently came out the story needed some improvements but was done well for an justice society introduction

Nov 13 2022,positive,a lot of action from beginning to end good story and it leaves you wanting to see more looking forward to what wbd has in store for future dc movies any of these negative reviews from critics is bogus its far better than anything marvel has dished out since endgame and the critics score is rigged
Nov 13 2022,positive,an all round enjoyable film nicely paced and a change from the norm
Nov 13 2022,positive,super great movie im glad we got to see henry cavil put the superman costume back on im glad hes back idk why critics hate this movie it was really good cgi was awesome it wouldve been more awesome if zachary levi did a cameo as shazam this movie was a 9510

Nov 13 2022,positive,i didnt expect it to be what it was after seeing all the negative press   but i went with my whole family including my parents they said was the best action movie they had seen an over a decade there were some funny moments sprinkled around but this was an action blockbuster in and out theres no way you can fall asleep in this   hats off to the cameos and the hawkman character significant effects and fight scenes i enjoyed this film i definitely will be buying it for the collection   i cant wait to see more of these kinda films
Nov 13 2022,positive,fun one time watch that was entertaining i dont think it is necessary to watch it in the cinema though the actors were great and funny but the plot got quite weak at the end the movie would have been better it it were 15 hours long and they didnt include sabbek
Nov 13 2022,positive,the action was great
Nov 13 2022,positive,vfx was fantastic plot was weak
Nov 13 2022,positive,a lot of action amazing choreography and all the power of the heroes were explored a big step forward for the extended dc universe
Nov 13 2022,positive,i loved that it captivated me very auctioned packed
Nov 13 2022,positive,inconsistent   not as funny as it wanted to be at times  not as suspenseful as it wanted to be at others
Nov 13 2022,positive,great action scenes great soundtrack great visuals and entertaining
Nov 13 2022,positive,it was a good movie i feel as all the acting outside of duwayne johnson was kinda lacking a few curveballs but nothing major  i wasnt disappointed i bought tickets it was a decent movie for sure
Nov 13 2022,positive,concise content  easy to see and understand people who dont follow the commic know about it the fight scene is very satisfying the movie effect is magnificent   sometimes funny  like very much

Nov 13 2022,positive,2hr of great action if you are a dc fan this is a must watch
Nov 13 2022,negative,what a terrible waste of time money and effort no emotional connection with the audience whatsoever
Nov 13 2022,positive,loved the concept of the movie a dark shazam vs the prim and proper kid friendly shazam overall great movie worth the price of admission lol
Nov 13 2022,neutral,the rock was cool thats it
Nov 13 2022,positive,i really like this movie its not perfect but funny
Nov 13 2022,negative,theater stinks very foul mildew order  sound quality was low  chairs uncomfortable very old theater

Nov 13 2022,positive,loved it interesting origin story that wasnt revealed completely until the end i enjoyed the action and the special effects with almost all action movies character development and relationship building take a back seat and i am okay with that there was enough here to make me care about the characters though i feel ready to see them all again bring on the sequel
Nov 13 2022,positive,great movie from start to finish
Nov 13 2022,positive,i liked the movie and honestly anything that dwayne johnson stars in is always awesome

Nov 13 2022,positive,storyline was good fight scenes well done cgi rock with small bod not good at all rock showed one of his best performances
Nov 13 2022,positive,the rock and all the special effects
Nov 13 2022,positive,lots of fun with a story that hangs together and only one place where my suspension of disbelief was tested better than most dc comic movies well worth the 
Nov 13 2022,positive,great movie one of the best dc have made
Nov 13 2022,positive,some standard action fare here but entertaining enough and a good complement for popcorn and a drink
Nov 13 2022,positive,missed a lot of good opportunities for comic relief which i feel is one of dcs main set backs maybe its in an attempt to not look like marvel but lets face it your a super hero movie inevitably in some way you look like marvel might as well make it as entertaining as possible which would include a better amount of humor
Nov 13 2022,negative,my 11 year old said this has a short plot nuff said
Nov 13 2022,positive,its a movie it wasnt bad it wasnt good it was just mediocre just like most superhero movies  unless you really love superhero movies or have 2 hours to kill watch something else
Nov 13 2022,positive,very good loved the fight scenes nothing rushed simple story 
Nov 13 2022,positive,a hot sticky mess of action balanced with a lot heart

Nov 12 2022,positive,love dc comicscant wait to the next one
Nov 12 2022,negative,most expensive cheap thrills ive seen in a while character development was lame or nonexistent i think were looking at the breakeven with superhero movies
Nov 12 2022,positive,action packed from start to finish
Nov 12 2022,positive,read so call critic views show their bias as an arab american i think it is ridiculous to complain about not the rick not having an accent have you seen the cartoons this is fantasy and a great movie for its genre not a historical documentary do t listen to the so called expert critics rate it yourself if you can let your mind beleive in a flying person for another planet you will enjoy it
Nov 12 2022,positive,greatest movie of all time  love the rock and cringe kid
Nov 12 2022,negative,do you want the truth more importantly can you handle the truth i was really disappointed with this movie the storyline was weak not enough backstory to keep you current with the direction this film was heading the acting was poor most of it was cgid so that takes away from the quality of visual and other special effects the best part of the movie was cliff hanger during credits were rolling save your money
Nov 12 2022,positive,plenty of action good pacing and definitely worth watching on the big screen 
Nov 12 2022,neutral,good popcorn flick especially for a lesser known dc antihero dr fate steals the show hackman was cool and of course superman 
Nov 12 2022,neutral,corny dialogue predictable story line maybe they will build a better movie on this theme at some point
Nov 12 2022,positive,the characters portrayed by dwayne johnson and pierce bronson were compelling enough and both showed just enough depth to emotionally connect with the audience  the remainder of the cast was decent but overall there was no depth to those characters  were introduced to various justice league players of which the movie essentially anticipates you already know who your comic heroes are and so at best you are given the 15second synopsis of what these players do and why they are valuable   and much of the movie is spent coping with the fact that hawkman is brutally angry all the time  were the wizards and demons perhaps developed a little more then the whole movie would have perhaps been more meaningful  as it is one is left wondering why in the world would anyone fight for that particular country when the whole place looks like a complete dump
Nov 12 2022,positive,i liked the action and the story i disliked the length of the film
Nov 12 2022,positive,this was a good movie  i am not a dwayne johnson fan so i was surprised that i liked this movie as much as i did  it was well done  worth seeing
Nov 12 2022,positive,i know the dc movies tend to get dumped on but i really enjoyed this one it may help that im a huge ardis hodge and duane johnson fan so a movie with both of them in it made my day  there is tons of action in this film so that was a plus wb brought together a great cast to bring forth a new group of beloved characters from my childhood  well done
Nov 12 2022,positive,movie fullfilled with good action great suits and costume designs and really fun jokes at some points i think that dwayne johnson wasnt the best cast idea for the character cgi falls appart in some points the antagonist is really bad
Nov 12 2022,positive,easily the best dc movie to date interesting story with great twists keeping you guessing
Nov 12 2022,positive,movie that not only looks fabulous but also is filled with action sequences and has a somewhat good story i recommend watching it if you are a fan of superhero movies or ifthe rock in general
Nov 12 2022,positive,mid story but great visuals sadly the rock was playing himself again
Nov 12 2022,neutral,lots of action storyline could have been better
Nov 12 2022,positive,it was a good movie over all but here are my thoughts just not marvel a bit cheesy at times and longer then it needed to be to much action with cgi that made you feel like the movie was fake
Nov 12 2022,positive,it was a great movie
Nov 12 2022,positive,probably one of the best dc films that have come out the rock doesnt play himself for once but still kills this role
Nov 12 2022,positive,as usual critics at rotten tomatoes get it wrong  the whole point of a film is for the purpose of entertainment the movie achieved this and therefore its a success
Nov 12 2022,positive,this is a very positive film indeed very enjoyable very entertaining
Nov 12 2022,negative,a lot of corny cliches eastern people oppressed by westerners yawn annoying cocky child hero groan lots and lots and lots of zapping with light beams invulnerable people crashing about i went to the toilet and missed nothing annoying knowing profound figures cod philosophy the route to death is life or viceverca gimmicky effects probably ok if you are a 12 year old there was some limited entertainment value in spotting the ancient egyptian references
Nov 12 2022,positive,great origin story movie my daughters loves it
Nov 12 2022,positive,the movie was serious and hilarious all at the same time loved the story line the conception on a new character and the cliffhanger at the end
Nov 12 2022,positive,it is a good movie dwayne is a great actor and the actions scenes are outstanding though the movie lacks elaboration and development it all seems to happen in three blocks of a very small town it does not make us believe the world is at stake it makes us believe there is a neighbourhood in danger
Nov 12 2022,positive,loved it great action scenes enjoyed the whole thing
Nov 12 2022,positive,awesome movie kinda slow start but made up for it with the action scenes
Nov 12 2022,positive,it is a good dc movie it certainly lived up to the hype
Nov 12 2022,positive,love dwayne johnson good action pretty good story line little burnt out on superheros so i liked that he kept saying im no hero
Nov 12 2022,neutral,mediocre at best only redeeming part is the fantastically choreographed action sequences
Nov 12 2022,positive,its not special in any way however its worth seeing if youre into the dceu
Nov 12 2022,positive,i liked the amount of action in it would recommend to friends
Nov 12 2022,positive,son and i watched this not end game but better than multiverse by a lot
Nov 12 2022,neutral,evil rock is not entertaining rock bizarre story most jokes dont land and all characters beside whoever brosnan was are forgettable
Nov 12 2022,positive,this movie was so gooood loved watching it and cgi was just awesome i have to say that rotten tomatoes need to work on its critics because they also gave man of steel less score unfortunately
Nov 12 2022,positive,very precised story and entertaining
Nov 12 2022,positive,a lot more entertaining than i expected  my son loved it
Nov 12 2022,negative,i appreciate this has been the rocks passion project for many years but you can tell the writers didnt have the same level of motivation the story had potential but the character development was so shallow the viewer didnt grow an emotional attachment to any of them  which made the rest of the movie not as interesting as to what was going to happen i saw on his instagram that he had scored the movie  so i was expecting an indiana jones or jurassic park type feelnope just a hodgepodge of random songs that didnt fit together at all also keeping kanye wests song in there during all the media about his antisemitism attitude and comments wasnt a good look but maybe they couldnt change it at that point even the actions seems were boring the only reason i gave it one star is because it entertained my nephews  pierce brosnan wins best actor out of the bunch
Nov 12 2022,positive,i was really not expecting that i really liked this movie  it has just the perfect balance in history and in fighting  cant wait to see whats coming in the next movie
Nov 12 2022,positive,it was entertaining and even funny lots of action but it was pretty predictable and the ending was kind of corny
Nov 12 2022,positive,absolutely fantastic
Nov 12 2022,positive,this is such a great popcorn movie
Nov 12 2022,positive,it definitely has its flaws but its enjoyable
Nov 12 2022,positive,great in every way actors story production
Nov 12 2022,positive,alot more action in this movie than logic but overall the movie is entertaining pretty much all the characters are likeable even though you dont really get the opportunity to know them
Nov 12 2022,positive,best hero movie of all time
Nov 12 2022,positive,an awesome movie its fresh and you must see it dc needs more like this
Nov 12 2022,positive,not like ground breaking or anything just a fun and funny superhero movie  the rock was great with a almost terminator like delivery on comedy  had a good time will definitely be buying this one  love supporting dc
Nov 12 2022,neutral,slow start story wasnt very great some funny moments
Nov 12 2022,positive,good movie you should see it for yourself
Nov 12 2022,positive,horrible opening not a great production
Nov 12 2022,positive,light hearted and exciting i do like a dwayne johnson movie
Nov 12 2022,positive,lots of action not a lot of acting
Nov 12 2022,positive,i liked it action packed looking forward to a sequel
Nov 12 2022,positive,i thought that this particular movie was well done and very entertaining i really liked the ending scene which i wont spoil here and thought it really setup some great possibilities for a sequel andor other movies in the dcu
Nov 12 2022,positive,about as rock as you can get this role is his element just a fun time
Nov 12 2022,positive,awesome action and great story
Nov 12 2022,positive,it was good entertainment
Nov 12 2022,positive,it is too warm in the theater room other than enjoyed the movie just not in comfort
Nov 12 2022,positive,pretty standard the rock movie hes badass he kick ass and take names and all that bla bla bla but the post credit scene was the best and damn you warner for making me hope about another sups movie i need another superman movie like chris reeve so i dont become cynical about everything that is happening to the world and maybe start dreaming instead of living this perpetual nightmare that is our lives in this rock called earth
Nov 12 2022,positive,the goat of all dc films
Nov 12 2022,positive,this was a pretty fun movie and one of the much better dceu movies  while there are parts that dont hold up like the scene at the end with the boy trying to inspire the people it is just so cringe the bulk of the movie has a lot to like  the characters are mostly good but they wasted atom smasher by keeping him to the side and only using him for comic relief and cyclone was just a complete waste as she does almost nothing in the movie  the other justice society members were enjoyable and pierce brosnan does a great job  the villain is just another dumb bad guy that is defeated with little fanfare or worry  overall though this is a fun addition to the dceu and is definitely worth seeing
Nov 12 2022,positive,i thought it was great movie
Nov 12 2022,positive,a good flick for a night out or a watch with the family solid action but could have been delivered better too much fluff and not enough substance doctor fate alone was worth the watch loved this character the other side characters were underdeveloped and sidelined doctor fate needs his own movie
Nov 12 2022,positive,comedy and enjoy looking forward to sequel
Nov 12 2022,positive,much better than i expected well produced and the ensemble cast was great pierce brosnan stole the show
Nov 12 2022,positive,it wasok not a movie i feel compelled to rewatch it felt formulaic the vfx was good i always enjoy the rock and i thoroughly enjoyed the midcredits scene which promises something special in the future i liked seeing hawkman and dr fate id love to see more of them but with a more nuanced performance from hawkman or perhaps a more emotionally complex story for him 
Nov 12 2022,positive,the interaction between main characters
Nov 12 2022,positive,this was definitely way better than some of the last couple of dc movies that have been released it wasnt my favorite but it was nothing on the film itself it just wasnt my fave
Nov 12 2022,positive,i really think i has a good story and its exiting to see how the dcu is going to be
Nov 12 2022,positive,holy crap  best movie of the year the rock was amazing cameo at the end was awesome
Nov 12 2022,positive,better than most other dc movies
Nov 12 2022,positive,i dont get why the critics hate this so much i thought the movie was perfect sure there are some flaws here and there but flaws do occur even in the best of movies either way the story that was told was brilliant the action was insane and some of the best the dcu has to offer and the cast i thought were very charismatic in their roles particularly pierce brosnan as doctor fate and dwayne johnson as black adam overall an enjoyable and entertaining film
Nov 12 2022,positive,do not listen to all the negative reviews if you have not watched this movie it is a must see for all especially comic book fans this movie was amazing from start to finish and i am so glad i went to see it best of all is dwayne johnson has saved dc and brought back the best superman ever thank you dwayne johnson and welcome back henry cavill
Nov 12 2022,positive,it was greati would see it again
Nov 11 2022,positive,great story and action
Nov 11 2022,positive,a movie i really enjoyed would recommend and definitely would watch the sequel
Nov 11 2022,positive,really good we loved seeing the rock in this role having superman appear during the credits has me patiently waiting for the sequel
Nov 11 2022,positive,seen it twice love it 
Nov 11 2022,positive,movie started slow but it was just giving you a little history it was super action packed till the very end be sure to hang around for an after show teaser it was kick ass
Nov 11 2022,positive,loved it  a lot of dry humor which may not play so well with some but i loved it
Nov 11 2022,positive,overall deceivingly really good the closest dc film thats felt like the dc animated movies
Nov 11 2022,neutral,i didnt like the story line characters in the story that added nothing to the movie meh
Nov 11 2022,positive,fantastic movie with adventure and lots of action i just didnt like that boring child but otherwise thanks
Nov 11 2022,positive,the rock is always great i really enjoyed the movie and the story line
Nov 11 2022,positive,great movie full of action intense fightscant wait for more with supes
Nov 11 2022,positive,it is very entertaining with small script twists and well argued it seemed to me a movie that gives a fresh air excellent for a new opportunity for dc
Nov 11 2022,positive,definitely a solid movie
Nov 11 2022,positive,good movie i enjoyed that there was a lot of action scenes the characters were believable this is probably one of the best dc films i have watched
Nov 11 2022,positive,great movie the special effects were amazing and realistic i enjoyed it because it wasnt dialogue heavy but you still could grasp the story line
Nov 11 2022,neutral,the movie does not have a distinct plot it simply repeats essentially the same scene the entire movie with slightly different backgrounds animations etc
Nov 11 2022,positive,i was surprised the movie was good did not expect much from the rock but he did a good job there the scenes with the kid and the whole anticapitalism etc is very cringe but still a lot of fight scenes and they are not afraid to show how strong the characters are
Nov 11 2022,positive,dc is currently getting better than marvel i just didnt like that they made him a hero
Nov 11 2022,positive,although the story is rough tons of great action and the entertainment quality of these stupid ass movies is there
Nov 11 2022,positive,entertaining and fun and mainly a setup for future films not a lot of depth to characters to make this more than just an enjoyable superhero film
Nov 11 2022,positive,stupid premise the justice society doesnt want to stop the intergang but instead wants to stop teth adams makes no sense
Nov 11 2022,positive,visually well crafted however characters were hard to have a connection to as the storyline was more action over deeper plotline and character developmentyes there should be more character depth in a comic franchise effects were on point  the 2 hours passed in a visually noisy story i could never really get attached to or feel any connection to the cast
Nov 11 2022,positive,one of my favorite dc movies to date
Nov 11 2022,positive,lots of potential but too many barely flushed out characters and derivative details confusing story lines
Nov 11 2022,positive,full of actions and exciting
Nov 11 2022,positive,great popcorn movie pretty simple story but the rock makes this movie good and ok parts but in the end we left the theater happy  critics are clearly being to harsh its a super hero movie not pride and prodigious  go see it if you like these type of films
Nov 11 2022,positive,a great fun ride and probably the best rock movie
Nov 11 2022,negative,extremely comercial and boring the rock always the rock same dude no matter the character nothing changed
Nov 11 2022,positive,the best 124 minutes ever underrated tbh
Nov 11 2022,positive,too much like a video game when imagining this is actually possible in real world conditions    finally became a movie with hearthumor in the final 20 minutes of the film
Nov 11 2022,positive,i thought the movie was good a lot of action throughout the film and interesting
Nov 11 2022,positive,it was alright there were some unnecessary characters and the editing was off sometimes but it was really fun overall
Nov 11 2022,positive,while a great movie and story it went long everything in the end could have been made into a separate movie
Nov 11 2022,positive,serviceable but by the end you are left with thinking how theres no point to this the movie shazam got there first so this film shouldnt and didnt need to be best part is after the credits started scene of course but id say it doesnt earn that either they shouldve included black adam with shazam and not had its own movie here no matter what the rock wanted
Nov 11 2022,positive,cast was amazing story needs a lot of help it was still a fun time 
Nov 11 2022,positive,the rock made the day fully action packed
Nov 11 2022,positive,i thought the movie was fantastic
Nov 11 2022,positive,good story good acting great action
Nov 11 2022,negative,not worth the ticket wait to stream it if you want to see it horrible cgi confusing storyline simply awful
Nov 11 2022,positive,full of action thank you dwayne johnson for the post credit scene
Nov 11 2022,negative,weak storyline he should face both superman and shazaam
Nov 11 2022,positive,i wanted action and i got action
Nov 11 2022,positive,a fantastic action packed movie one of the best superhero movies ive seen in a long time
Nov 11 2022,positive,lots of funnonstop action my adult kids and i enjoyed it
Nov 11 2022,negative,rubbish film another dceu flop
Nov 11 2022,positive,this was a really fun one with wonderful action sequences and comedy the characters are also cool but dont expect to come into the theaters and see a movie thats deep and takes its time with the characters
Nov 11 2022,positive,absolutely loved it
Nov 11 2022,positive,you get what you sign up for with the rock starring in another action film visuals effects are top notch here with great moments and a surprisingly fantastic score its a movie you can sit back and watch anytime for those reasons alone dc just needs to stick to gritty darker movies because thats what they are good at stop trying to be marvel and do you own thing if this was rated r with a serious tone i guarantee i would be giving this 5 stars but what we get works and nothing flops too hard here except the acting
Nov 11 2022,positive,great movie full entertainment dwayne johnsons dream project is perfect
Nov 11 2022,positive,i thought rock was going to be the only one highlighted but dang everyone carried this movie  its a fantastic movie also i didnt get the presence of thee rock that much  thats good
Nov 11 2022,negative,dull i was sleeping in the cinema
Nov 11 2022,positive,what more can you ask for
Nov 11 2022,positive,best dc movie ive watched
Nov 11 2022,positive,its a movie that is all
Nov 11 2022,positive,plenty of dull moments
Nov 11 2022,positive,i grew up reading comics and watching action flicks im also a minority in many ways but lets be 100 real here    theres a reason the audience score for this movie sings praises and a reason why critics are now all of a sudden critical of comic book movies simply put i can probably count on one hand how many major plots there are for them but alas i digress    this movie is not different in that regard however this movie challenges the status quo it doesnt dabble in it mention a few lines or quotes it makes it a major part of the story which you can feel    this movie has a iykyk message but even if you and or others dont know its very enjoyable    critics may have to appease their advertisers subscribers and or tow the line but the audience they either like it or they dont and obviously we love it
Nov 11 2022,positive,one of the best movies i have ever seen just amazing and i loved dr fate hope to see more of him in the future
Nov 11 2022,positive,great movie cant wait to see part 2
Nov 11 2022,negative,i got up and left the movies it was boring with a lot of fight scenessmh
Nov 11 2022,positive,it was overall decent the story seemed slightly under developed it seemed that the film relied too heavily on the rock bringing in their audience besides this there was some humor and some badass fight scenes but the characters were not super lovable and best part of the movie was henry cavils return
Nov 11 2022,negative,another terrible movie from dc was completely boring bad acting and terrible rushed storyline movie was way too long my son loved it though 
Nov 11 2022,positive,its a lot of fun its vacant rather formulaic simple in story with your expected fight scenes coming often in other words its a hero or at least an antihero action flick simple as that to all the pompous purveyors of arthouse frumpery and tightarseery  the rock brosnan hodge as an allout selfimportant pompous putz were great sure the alltoo generic bad guy troops with their little rifles and pistols was so tired have these fools never seen one of these movies yeah it was awfully easy for her to read these super nebulous little raised stone etchings and the opening voiceover exposition went on a while   but im not watching these action flicks for deep profound statements or existential angst im not looking for some revelation on the human condition or mike leighesque realism no altman reflections on modern america or zemeckiss emphasis one character development   its sit back n enjoy comfort food good vs evil superhero style the origin story was fine the super powers were great the fight scenes were very good there were some pretty decent and fairly regular comic relief points and there was some perfectly fine resolution  32 stars
Nov 11 2022,positive,loved it an absolute must see 
Nov 11 2022,positive,not perfect but i had a lot of fun with this movie better than morbius and thor in this year
Nov 11 2022,positive,it has good action but def too much satanic signs and symbols made me uncomfortable
Nov 11 2022,positive,finally a dc movie that is worthy of 5 stars fun to watch all the way through
Nov 11 2022,negative,lots of action and little story another movie of the rock being the rock
Nov 11 2022,positive,great movie love the new rock and old superman
Nov 11 2022,positive,awesome movie entertaining my wife and kids loved it too the rock nailed it keep making movies like this please henry cavill is back as superman too it doesnt get better than that
Nov 11 2022,positive,fun  action packed it seems to me however the cgi in dc films arent as flawless as marvel films anyone else agree the film also seems too long just when it seems over it continues
Nov 11 2022,positive,was absolutely amazing loved every bit of the movie besides people recording the movie and not stop talking during the movie over all 100000000010
Nov 11 2022,positive,its the rock what else can i say meh story good action
Nov 11 2022,positive,really loved the action why else would i rewatch this movie
Nov 11 2022,positive,fun loud things blow up laughing out loud but its all about family in the end
Nov 11 2022,positive,everything you need in a heros movie i love it awesome
Nov 11 2022,positive,no one can really say this was a great movie i love the rock as much as the next guy but some cringe moments way too slowmo scenes and the support cast other than fate was pretty useless the villain wasnt great either  wasnt so interested
Nov 11 2022,positive,in my last rate that was one thing that i did forget to say the demon part was the best thing of the whole movie they should have added a lot more of that side to the movie and of course thats just my opinion everyone has their own but who doesnt love a good demon story especially nowadays when everything around us is starting to become just like underworld hell
Nov 11 2022,positive,one of the best dc movies i have ever seen action great story and straightforward awesomeness
Nov 11 2022,positive,full of action doctor fate the most badass character
Nov 10 2022,positive,worth seeing a lot of action from beginning to end
Nov 10 2022,positive,i loved the movie and the storyline and the introduction of characters new and ones we have come to love
Nov 10 2022,positive,the best there is the best there was a good start to the new dc studios team keep more films coming
Nov 10 2022,positive,nothing new they tried too hard to be funny good to disconect your brain
Nov 10 2022,positive,fast pacedfirst dc movie where it didnt rain for 2 and half hours
Nov 10 2022,positive,a fun action packed comic book hero movie good acting good story
Nov 10 2022,neutral,just another superhero movie johnsons backstory was kinda interesting but had no real emotional heft or weight could have been executed in much more interesting and artistic way johnson shoulda done shazam here hes just a brooding bore
Nov 10 2022,positive,great movie with exceptional action sequences
Nov 10 2022,negative,bad and boring generic superhero movie that tries to put an edgie spin on it coz he kills people    dosnt understand the subject matter and its honestly creepy to see a guy who publicly executes people praised and idolised
Nov 10 2022,negative,i liked the ending but wish it was funnier especially w the rock in it i had higher hopes for comedy
Nov 10 2022,positive,its a pretty mediocre movie and its not necessarily bad  its just dc excited to find a formula that was already known
Nov 10 2022,negative,boring and honestly just a hot mess
Nov 10 2022,positive,good entertainment movie good action
Nov 10 2022,positive,entertaining funny action packed what the super hero genre should be
Nov 10 2022,positive,nice film going the right way
Nov 10 2022,positive,is so fantastic    i love it   the movie was great 
Nov 10 2022,positive,an honest antihero origin story pretty close to the comic books and a lot of fun but they miss used de jsa
Nov 10 2022,positive,its not the best dc movie its not even an average dc film but i think is a good movie
Nov 10 2022,positive,it is an amazing movie with high quality cgi vfx actions as a dc fan i enjoyed the movie
Nov 10 2022,negative,never realized how much of a one role actor the rock was until this movie if its not a cop role then its bad this role was not a cop role so of course the acting was bad really bad    the story was also poorly written the supporting characters had no personality or development they were just stand ins who said a few lines randomly the whole movie just felt wrong     the only saving grace was doctor fate and of course dc nerfed his abilities and oh course the return of superman
Nov 10 2022,positive,took the kids and we had an awesome 120min of fun
Nov 10 2022,positive,some sloppy arguments and one or two cringe scenes but generally awesome
Nov 10 2022,positive,already seen this twice its exactly what you think of if you combine the rock and superhero movie highly recommended
Nov 10 2022,positive,great movie lots of action scenes cant wait for whats coming usually im not a fan of dc movies but this one was really good
Nov 10 2022,positive,good presentation good wit not afraid to show power or overpower
Nov 10 2022,positive,all the cast was amazing ty dc
Nov 10 2022,negative,the film didnt know where to go and johnson acted partly like in his comedies
Nov 10 2022,negative,expected a lot more flat storey line with no character development possibly the rocks worst 
Nov 10 2022,positive,great fight scenes great music and special efects
Nov 10 2022,positive,simple storyline packed with action scenes this is the reason we watch a superhero movies
Nov 10 2022,neutral,its a good action movie but lacked some depth in the storyline and plots about the main character but it was good to watch
Nov 10 2022,positive,went to see it for my birthday and loved it the costumes and set were brilliant the acting of some of the cast could be better it was a bit on the cringe cheesy side but the action was good the story line was interesting and kept me watching there were some laugh out loud moments as well
Nov 10 2022,positive,good action movie the combat sequence are cool the story is in between good and bad but its a good movie and not boring
Nov 10 2022,positive,it wasnt as big of a hype as advertised cheesy dialogue character development wasnt there and music soundtrack choice in some moments kinda took you out of the film    i did love the action scenes best that ive seen in a while the cameo appearances were worth while to see especially mid credit scene    overall not the strongest movie to make a huge comeback in dc with that said it still is a fun movie and i could tell dwayne and the production team and cast had a blast definitely watch again but wait til it streams
Nov 10 2022,negative,bad plot bad characters apart from dr fate bad humour mediocre action dont watch
Nov 10 2022,neutral,  the movie suffers from alot of underlying factors  dialogue character development pacing and most of all rockfatigue     some parts of the movie were phenomenal but between the cgi boss fights and some ps2 level cg i just cant get behind this movie
Nov 10 2022,negative,great action and everything but the movie just has no plot
Nov 10 2022,positive,even tho the storyline is so so i love the movie we need more superheroes that dont hesitate to kill with cool but not gore fans of the fighting scenes with dragonball comic style
Nov 10 2022,positive,dont let the naysay critics fool you go see for yourself you wont be disappointed
Nov 10 2022,negative,awful cheesy dialogue ham acting such a disappointment slow start and the movie really dragged on worst movie ive seen in quite a while
Nov 10 2022,positive,this movie is awesome fun dark  acation total package   better than shazam movie
Nov 10 2022,positive,amazing movie congrats for making it for fans
Nov 10 2022,negative,if you just switch of your brain and enjoy the action its ok the character development was so poor i didnt even care about the main villain
Nov 10 2022,positive,definitely a comic book movie
Nov 10 2022,positive,  well not marvel fans for sure but the story was actually interesting and touching    acting  amazing
Nov 10 2022,positive,a fun actionpacked night at the movies the backstory for the character was done in a concise manner which allowed the movie to move at a high attentionholding pace a good storyline a few dashes of humor and a heavy dose of action equals great movie and a very enjoyable evening among the best of the dc universe movies well done
Nov 10 2022,positive,great cgi and tons of action but lacked character development
Nov 10 2022,positive,its a good time the issue for me when it comes to the dceu is that the writing just seems to come last the only things that save this movie are the comedic moments and the action the writing the character development the character introductionall lacking however i see what theyre trying to do theyre finally marvelizing the dceuand it think its all leading up to something thats worth it i just hope i dont give up before then
Nov 10 2022,positive,the movie was great nonstop action with some slide of hand trick thrown in there lived up to its hype of the movie
Nov 10 2022,positive,great special effects and characters story telling at its best who doesnt love an antihero
Nov 10 2022,positive,  the whole family thoroughly enjoyed the movie and you wouldnt have to be a dc comic fan to enjoy it in fact most of us felt the addition of the justice league didnt add anything to the movie  if you want an excellent action flick with a little humor and cool effects this is good for you
Nov 10 2022,negative,a very shallow story writing and not much character development cant see how this movie would take 15 years to publish
Nov 10 2022,positive,awesome epic story great fight scenes power balances were done really well for the different characters for the most part dwayne johnson was amazing dr fate was done sooo good as well
Nov 10 2022,positive,action packed only downside is it could be a bit too much
Nov 10 2022,positive,great movie nice to finally see a super hero that will do what it takes
Nov 10 2022,positive,love it awsome movie
Nov 10 2022,positive,i loved the movie no fuss lots of action stunning visuals wonderful music and sound effects comedy in the right dose no complaints theres no way to get bored watching this movie action from start to finish and it was a nice hook to introduce the justice society
Nov 10 2022,positive,its a good movie some characters haved so much potential and i liked what they did with my favorites characters in this movie but i hate the kid
Nov 10 2022,negative,more of the same from marvel  cd comic movies villain turns hero and saves the world perhaps a look into the future when the antichrist returns to save the world
Nov 10 2022,positive,fun amazing story full of action love how this movie literally sets up the dcu so many places to go
Nov 10 2022,positive,better than i expected though characters like the tornado girl and atom smasher seemed pointless was very excited to see a certain cameo
Nov 9 2022,positive,it was lots of action had me on the edge of my seat overall good movie
Nov 9 2022,positive,enjoyable and fun to watch
Nov 9 2022,positive,the movie was really good the best movie ive seen in a minute the only thing i didnt like was that they made dr fate weaker atom smasher and tornado was utterly pointless in the movie but overall pretty awesome
Nov 9 2022,positive,this movie was fun why the negative reviews by the critics i dont get it yes its the rock but pierce brosnan is good in this as well
Nov 9 2022,negative,not worth watching at all
Nov 9 2022,positive,better than i expected i wish the rock would consider throwing on a wig here and there he just always looks exactly the same in every movie not having hair and being able to wear a wig could really add to his characters from time to time the supporting cast was the best part for me
Nov 9 2022,positive,liked it a lot but a little too long
Nov 9 2022,positive,can you smell what the rock is cooking for part 2 vs superman
Nov 9 2022,positive,easy to follow story line lots of action good selection of cast membets
Nov 9 2022,positive,the rock and pierce brosnan did not disappoint  the twists and turns within the film were expertly executed
Nov 9 2022,negative,terribly fast paced with characters you dont care about it felt like a movie where the heros who have all had individuals films finally come together but without the good script or the individual films to provide a back drop they could have made this so much better giving it time and more work very rushed and easy to lose interest before half way through
Nov 9 2022,positive,the movie is awesome and a must watch it feels fresh to watch a movie like this simple but epic fights scene i recommend to any superheroes fans
Nov 9 2022,positive,great action and funny
Nov 9 2022,positive,outstanding movie many critics criticized the weak plot but the characters and the action makes this movie a total win and makes the future bright for the dceu
Nov 9 2022,positive,i really enjoyed the action and after all the problems behind the scene it was good to see warner bros release a dc movie that did not disappoint the cast was great and dwayne the rock johnson is built for this role was also great to see doctor fate on the big screen for the first time as he is one of my dc heroes of all time
Nov 9 2022,positive,the first and second act is good but the third is great with plot twist i never thought
Nov 9 2022,positive,lol perfect hero movie
Nov 9 2022,positive,as a comic book fan since i was a kid its great to see characters i grew up with come to the big screen so im stoked now as far a storys go i know you got to know the difference between someone that knows the character and someone that dont so the kid in me says loved it
Nov 9 2022,positive,fun to watch it had its moment
Nov 9 2022,positive,stunning amazing i enjoyed watching this movie so bad fx was spectacular
Nov 9 2022,positive,very enjoyable movie action packed and the rock did very well in this movie the supporting actors and actresses did awesome comedy did great the kid was a little bit annoying also i wish we saw hell for longer but overall it was a fantastic dc movie
Nov 9 2022,positive,i thot it built up suspense like alfred hichcock
Nov 9 2022,positive,welcome superman welcome dc thank you  dwayne  you are a hero
Nov 9 2022,positive,its an wonderful movie by a spanish born director jaume colletserra with screenplay of adam sztykiel rory haines and sohrab noshirvani and produced by the leading actor dwayne johnson    theres a strong casting behind such as pierce brosnan
Nov 9 2022,positive,i enjoyed it lots of action the surround sound excellent very good storyline cant wait to see the next one
Nov 9 2022,negative,do yourself a favour and watch something else it was highly mid alas the rocks performance was quite spectacular its only redeeming feature was the end credit appearance the rest was mid watch one piece instead
Nov 9 2022,positive,this is the greatest piece of writing i have ever witnessed in a film
Nov 9 2022,positive,theres stuff to pick at and stuff to cheer at dwayne clearly loves this character and wants to do him justice but some of the story pacing and side characters hamper what in my opinion take away from adam himself the pg13 rating also dampened a lot of the brutality its so clear they wanted this character to have but theres the blueprint here for a character especially under the riskloving comic book movie god that now oversees dc that could become a real bright spot in the dc universe
Nov 9 2022,positive,well worth seeing great action and really fun could have done with a bit more of a storyline but still great regardless
Nov 9 2022,positive,even though some people might not like it i like how the movie is dragging out the ending it makes me surprised and though the movie ended way earlier which is a good thing as i enjoyed the movie a lot
Nov 9 2022,positive,refreshing different vibes than most of the other super hero type movies wpuld see it a few more times on the big screen great action scenes
Nov 9 2022,positive,back storylinewow how timely the cgi and end credits were incredible  sorry to see kentdr fate go smasher funny and cyclone empowering ooh the sneak peek of superman to come i learned a long time ago you do not leave until all credits are done so not to miss out  so much but not enough time
Nov 9 2022,positive,just a great movie and i highly recommend it
Nov 9 2022,positive,i like the movie usually dc movies are dark this one was better visually

Nov 9 2022,positive,fun and exciting movie with a likable antihero
Nov 9 2022,positive,not the best but all first movies arent what everyone wants
Nov 9 2022,positive,amazing movie great actors cant wait for the next one
Nov 9 2022,negative,this movie was awful and im a huge fan of the rock it dragged on about an hour too long and was so predictable no just no
Nov 9 2022,positive,excellent movie glad to see dc universe beginning to produce movies equivalent to the mcu

Nov 9 2022,positive,was dope to see the jsa was fun
Nov 9 2022,positive,fun movie deserves to be watched in theatres
Nov 9 2022,positive,i just went to see rock but the movie was actually enjoyable with loads and loads of action and rock was awesome as always
Nov 9 2022,positive,solid for a super movie villain sucked but his death scene was incredibly satisfying and effectively done i was pleasantly surprised by dwayne johnsons acting because he didnt just play the rock as ive seen in a lot of his films minor things like the needless teen romance subplot and blatant deadpool mask ripoff were mostly overshadowed by the better parts of the film also addresses important and relevant topics which is always a plus for me
Nov 9 2022,negative,dc just cant seem to get it right such a wasted opportunity to do an origin story
Nov 9 2022,positive,honestly exceeded my expectations although there were scenes that left me wanting more i still appreciate this movie for what they did and making it its own film
Nov 9 2022,positive,it was a great movie cant wait to see if they make a part 2
Nov 9 2022,negative,poor character development over the top cgi and the story itself was terribly written
Nov 9 2022,negative,it was comically bad  and maybe these characters were in the dc universe first but half the characters are bad versions of marvel characters
Nov 9 2022,positive,it was a fun movie i liked it i dont know why people are so critical enjoy the movie
Nov 9 2022,positive,loved it  just when you think youve seen the action scene and the movie is over bam plot twist and another action scene
Nov 9 2022,positive,good movie lots of action
Nov 9 2022,positive,no veted backstory on the jsa  very quick and vague explanation of who they are how they got their powers nothing at all not even a tease on hawkman great end credit scene
Nov 9 2022,positive,love the antihero vibe  great the way the justice society was cast and used as a foil for moving the story along  cant wait for a sequel
Nov 9 2022,positive,it was a great movie it kept me entertained at all times  there was never a dull moment 
Nov 9 2022,negative,dumbest movie ive seen in a long time
Nov 9 2022,positive,great movie all around
Nov 8 2022,negative,i was really bored by the storyline and didnt develop empathy with any of the characters because the movie didnt take time to introduce them properly which would have been hard anyway because there were simply too many of them
Nov 8 2022,positive,i did not like that it was not in 4k and i loved seeing superman
Nov 8 2022,positive,this movie is a very solid superhero movie for people looking for an enjoyable film period    if youre a pretentious movie snob that analyzes every second of scene of every  scene of every film because youre looking for attention then your kind is not welcome this movie wasnt made for you jabronis    this movie is made for people that know what the rock cooks whenever he cooks this movie cooks because its packed with action highly recommended
Nov 8 2022,positive,i enjoyed all of the action although the ending drug on awhile but mostly it was great
Nov 8 2022,positive,the rock said let there be lightning shazam
Nov 8 2022,negative,was a major let down for me personally dont believe the hype for this it was boring and the fact that the main character of the film was reduced to a minor character was a big blow for me action packed and awesome to look at but if you want an interesting story this aint it
Nov 8 2022,positive,loved the movie lots of action and didnt take long to transition between peacetime to fight one thing i wish couldve been better is the heros couldve been more understanding but its just like hawk man would be so im not taking anything away from it
Nov 8 2022,positive,i dont get the critics low score this movie was really entertaining sure not the best movie of the year but clearly the biggest fun i had this year since top gun its action packed no lengthy useless scenes and dialogues really great change compared to the bad stuff hollywood has been producing lately worth seeing in theaters
Nov 8 2022,positive,this follows the formula but its a fun ride with a lot of action one would want in an action movie
Nov 8 2022,positive,i has its flaws but the charm and spectacle of the rock and the promise of cavill returning as superman do a lot to boost its appeal
Nov 8 2022,positive,great movie great plot twists overall rating by my opinion is a 785
Nov 8 2022,negative,so disappointing story line was lacking character development was weak and dialog was boring  allinall a let down
Nov 8 2022,positive,it wasnt a bad movie but i feel like superhero movies are losing their luster if i had waited to see it after it left the theater i would not have felt like i missed out
Nov 8 2022,negative,poor story awkward cinematography and the rock being the rock what could go wrong
Nov 8 2022,positive,great action loved it
Nov 8 2022,positive,amazing movie great coming from dc keep it up
Nov 8 2022,negative,disappointed the rock is so funny yet somehow the way they filmed this all of his jokes fell flat and they introduced all these other characters that just werent needed at all it just convoluted the story line dc why you could have had a decent movie
Nov 8 2022,negative,they were advertising so much that i thought it was going to be the greatest movie of the year since i like dwayne johnson so much unfortunately this movie its just okay  more like mehh movie its the type of movie that you watch at your house and you dont really care if you fall asleep
Nov 8 2022,positive,not into superhero comic movies but this was great and kept my attention the whole time
Nov 8 2022,positive,was much better than i thought my daughter loved the movie she young and at times on some movies she will get bored great family movies
Nov 8 2022,positive,the movie was great a lot of action that we were hoping to see and the casts are more than perfect dj was the perfect man for the job pierce brosnan as dr fate was refreshing as we hope to see him again in future projects
Nov 8 2022,negative,whats a practical effect
Nov 8 2022,neutral,the movie doesnt truly live up to its title character the movie surely has its moments but they are few and far between the side characters did not add much to the overall story the movie had a lot of untapped potential which could have elevated from its current mediocrity all in all its not a bad movie in any way but just another generic superhero movie with spectacle and not adding anything new to this genre
Nov 8 2022,positive,story wasnt great but the action was amazing had a lot of fun watching it finally a good dc movie
Nov 8 2022,positive,the rock made it worth going to see overall a good movie dc still needs to learn the art of character development for some of the main characters
Nov 8 2022,positive,this movie was pretty good  and it was pretty entertaining the only problem i had with this was the villain  and everything else was good  i also recommend this movie if your a huge shazam fan too and if youre a huge black adam fan too this movie is also pretty underrated but i still dont want a sequel to black adam i think it will lack the original story and will be less successful and entertaining but in the end its a good movie  and i wish they have had a better villain if it did have a better villain it would be 4 stars but because they had a bad villain its only 3 stars
Nov 8 2022,negative,plus for the score the cinematography and the choreography of the action scences but the plot and dialogues are an insult to human intelligence the second to worst dceu movie after ayers suicide squad
Nov 8 2022,positive,probably the best super hero movie ive seen in a long time i loved the post credits scene
Nov 8 2022,positive,the movie talks with the audience and send the message that isnt necessary pleasure the movies analysts  with your sold and biased point of view    i went to the theater with my family and we have a great and fun time watch one of the best heros movie ever congrats dc
Nov 8 2022,positive,cgi aside this is what i grew up wanting comicbook movies to look like i enjoyed the angle taken as well as the action
Nov 8 2022,positive,one of the best superhero movies of all time
Nov 8 2022,positive,since a long time a nice movie to see

Nov 8 2022,positive,great movie  story line
Nov 8 2022,negative,nothing new dwayne johnson plays as dwayne johnson in this movie
Nov 8 2022,positive,its as good as it looks in the trailer  casting45 characters4 character development45 story35 action5 score4 cinematography5 average score  45
Nov 8 2022,neutral,it was ok  look the rock is the rock but hes no denzel or leo  those are premier actors hes okay but man he did look the part  the storyline felt a little meh so did the way the movie progressed no real ebb and flow  some parts felt choppy but what do i know  im just a shmuck behind a keyboard
Nov 8 2022,negative,i love the rock but this movie has no story no script and its not even funny save your money
Nov 8 2022,positive,great action great music
Nov 7 2022,positive,great family movie clean humor and dialog fresh look at super heroes a little predictable in the plot it was a great movie for the big screen
Nov 7 2022,positive,great special effects  story
Nov 7 2022,positive,pretty bad ending the rest of it was decent
Nov 7 2022,negative,nonsense movie im sick of these movies for 15 year oldswalked out before it ended just to save my hearing
Nov 7 2022,positive,total action explosive 100
Nov 7 2022,positive,i enjoyed the movie  very good i was a little upset they killed off dr fate still a good movie
Nov 7 2022,positive,they placed a real life super hero in dwayne johnson into the strongest fictionaltheatrical super hero weve seen and its mind blowing not going to lie as a marvel hero this movie alone will strongly consider dc if you havent seen it and youre a marvel fan hurry up and get a ticket worth every penny dc back in the map
Nov 7 2022,positive,not overwhelmingly impressed not very good story line
Nov 7 2022,positive,soooo freaking amazing
Nov 7 2022,positive,would have been a perfect 2 hour movie
Nov 7 2022,positive,better than anticipated stay past ending credits 
Nov 7 2022,positive,the performances and style are all palatable and its a generally interesting story slightly weighed down by cg bloat the humour might feel awkward at times but its generally a fun time with some real great elements that somehow dont come out fully
Nov 7 2022,positive,the movie was great good action scenes and amazing new characters introduced it really got the message across that this is going to be a new powerful figure in the new dc universe 9 out of 10
Nov 7 2022,positive,i enjoyed the action and subtle humor throughout the whole movie and there is definitely not enough talk about sarah shahi she did an amazing job
Nov 7 2022,positive,better then expected
Nov 7 2022,positive,this movie was surprisingly really funny the characters are actually likable unlike most dc movies and the ending was a bit much but overall it was an average super hero movie but with the added humor to carry this movie
Nov 7 2022,negative,tbh the movie is okay to watch but again a serious proof that dc dont know how to make super heroes movie  they just copy again and again  im pretty sure you can make the same movie from a meltinpot of other scenes from ohter dc and marvel movies  the story  the fights are already seen thousand of times nothing new just an epic super good loking movie thanks to the budget
Nov 7 2022,positive,this movie was great hawkman dr fate cyclone and atom smasher were absolutely fantastic and the rock played black adam as best as i couldve imagined i know its not fair but im a hypocrite this dc movie was better than anything disney marvel has done since infinity war id say end game but the all woman sjw nonsensical scene at the end ruined it for me go see black adam if you dont want any narrative shoved down your throat
Nov 7 2022,positive,who are the idiots who make the critics on tomatometer  this movie was one of the best of dc    what can we expect if the gave 97 to mrs marvel come on
Nov 7 2022,positive,the movie was awesome i just notice that the airplanes scene from the trailer was removed from the movie
Nov 7 2022,positive,i really enjoyed it dont care about professional reviews trust the audience
Nov 7 2022,positive,very entertaining the action was great and you empathize with the characters looking forward to seeing whats next cmon wbd cheers to the rock and s
Nov 7 2022,positive,black adam is really good movie that i highly recommend audiences to watch because it is really an actionpacked movie with dwyane johnson and costarring with pierce borson and others the characters are really good and well developed so yeah the journey with black adam hawkman and doctor fate are really worth seeing
Nov 7 2022,positive,one of the better marvelsuper hero movies ive seen tells a good back story along with the present story without wasting a lot of time
Nov 7 2022,positive,i love psycho and i love all of the scenes in this movie and the  special effects
Nov 7 2022,negative,good fighting but the content is too bland and boring
Nov 7 2022,positive,absolutely loved it great pacing fantastic cast   reviewers are often out of touch with the audience this is one of those times trust the audience rating go see the movie its great
Nov 7 2022,neutral,definitely too much with the cgi and the story was a bit muddled
Nov 7 2022,positive,loved it gave me everything i wanted plus a little more at the very end so happy they finally made something for the fans
Nov 7 2022,positive,i like how the justice society was in it wish there were more memorable members tho i loved dr fate character thought he was the best i wish there was more backstory to their characters
Nov 7 2022,positive,hello guys it was pretty goodi wouldnt rank it has one of the best thoughit was entertaining
Nov 7 2022,negative,cool to see fate and adam but storyline was terrible not worth paying for would have rather waited 
Nov 7 2022,positive,went in with lowtono expectations  was shocked that i enjoyed the movie so much  i was on the fence about even seeing it but walked out really glad i did  after a lot of conversation the general consensus between a group of marvelloving movie goers was that this movie was really good and maybe even better than some marvel movies  the cgi isnt quite on par in some areas but it wasnt horrible  its the first of what will most likely be a series of sequels  since ba isnt exactly a top dc super hero the storyline itself was simple  easy to follow which is what you need for the first installment unless you know the background then you may be a bit disappointed  the casting is spoton and i wasnt able to pick a favorite character because they were all good but if i had to choose it would be  dr fate  pierce brosnan is the perfect dr fate  played the wise superhero to a t  i hope they find a way to bring him back if they do have a sequel  not sure what issue critics had with this movie  the characters were fun  the movie kept my attention throughout which is exactly what a good movie is supposed to do  like i said the storyline was slow but it needed to be  one of the few things i didnt like was when they obviously superimposed bas head on a body that wasnt his  the way they did it was kind of creepy but that could just be me  if youre into super heroaction movies i 100 recommend seeing this one  this is definitely not one of those godawful dc movies youre used to so dont let the previous ones keep you from going to see this one
Nov 7 2022,positive,better than ms marvel
Nov 7 2022,positive,it was very funny with good action there were a lot of elements taken from other movies i felt like id seen most of the movie before im a little tired of the rock he is good but in everything lately
Nov 7 2022,positive,one of the best superhero movies ive seen i strongly recommend it
Nov 7 2022,positive,i thought it was a great movie its full of action and entertain thats what i want from a superhero movie not sure why all the negative reviews this does what an action movie should takes you away for a few hours this isnt supposed to be some thoughtprovoking movie i think people just want to complain go see it if you love superheroes and action
Nov 7 2022,positive,great movie with beautiful action scenes and very frantic could have less jokes and comedic scenes take one of the supporting characters more seriously but as a whole the film is excellent
Nov 7 2022,positive,great movie literally little to no dull moments
Nov 7 2022,positive,enjoyed the story line of the movie also the movie had about the right amount of action
Nov 7 2022,positive,once again the experts are wrong easily the best dc movie
Nov 7 2022,positive,this was a good superhero movie but only during the spooky season i dont wanna spoil too much but if this were on tv i would change the channel or fast forward through all of the original story obviously the cinamatic lore couldnt be as developed  as the original source material at least for me i enjoyed shazam a little bit more however you cant help but give kudos to the casting director and the vision he had to be fair this movie didnt have any pacing issues i feel the wealth accumulated on the opening week was not indicative of the love this character received across other platforms
Nov 7 2022,negative,shallow and awful in short it felt like the worst kind of michael bay movie  there was great action and special effects but there was little to no character development or explanation for why a character was in the story at all  what there was of character development was all derivative and stereotypical
Nov 7 2022,positive,its nonstop action from beginning to end i recommend it
Nov 7 2022,positive,really good action not that that good dialogue but the action makes up for it
Nov 7 2022,positive,i felt this movie was good for all ages i loved the ending
Nov 7 2022,positive,once again the old guard official reviewers totally missed the mark and the fans compensated for their bs 40 approval rating from the pros vs 89 from 5000 real people  thank you to rotten tomatoes for proving once again that the paid reviewers are soooooo out of touch with the regular folks that its pretty embarrassing great job to all the folks involved in making this movie happen and kudos to the rock for seeing it through top critic reviews are a joke at this point its basically a circle jerk of kickbacks and overexcited corporate fluffers in a room with their peroneal assistants enabling them
Nov 7 2022,negative,no plot  floating adam the whole movie was cheesy actors kept breaking character too much cgi  could have been way better for the cost to produce
Nov 7 2022,positive,the movie is as good as the audience score made it seem i gave a high score to adjust the low ratting that the dude neaster gave it
Nov 7 2022,positive,good movie i enjoy every second
Nov 7 2022,negative,did not like that it was a superman mock
Nov 7 2022,positive,super good movie i would recommend it to my friends and family
Nov 7 2022,positive,most people said it was abit of a let downkinda true but after seeing superman in the end i know it will get better in part 2
Nov 7 2022,positive,decent movie to watch just once
Nov 7 2022,positive,this was a solid enjoyable comic book movie it showcased excellent action sequences fantastic visual effects several very good characters pierce brosnan being masterful aldis hodge with a great performance of a strong personality and a good counter reflection to the more positively aligned good guy shazam while the concept of not knowing who is really the good and bad guy here works to make the story interesting it also muddles it i did not find myself cheering for one side or another like captain america civil war but was left feeling that i didnt know who i wanted to win until towards the end of the movie the later parts of the movie that focused on the normal humans felt like they offset the pace and distracted from the super powered characters would recommend
Nov 7 2022,positive,the movie was okay i was hoping for more for a starter movie hoping it gets better unfortunately it had some somewhat cheezy parts the fight scenes were dope and made black adam a bamf the rock and pierce brosnan carried the film all the other characters were shit very lame and i didnt give two shits about them at all nevertheless it was better than most of the dog shit dc has put out ill watch the next one
Nov 7 2022,positive,just got home from seeing it and i didnt think i would like it and it was surprised it was great and such awesome effects
Nov 7 2022,positive,it was a good version of the story
Nov 7 2022,positive,there was stuff in the trailer that wasnt in the movie though the movie was good i think a better movie was left on the editing room floor it was good but it could have been so much better maybe a directors cut would really do the genre justice
Nov 7 2022,negative,waste of time thank god ive watched this online otherwise i would loose my money 
Nov 7 2022,positive,black adam is something incredible it is something that transmits an incredible emotion it is true that sometimes it feels very violent or very fast but the rhythm is good the cgi is incredible and the script is beautiful black adam is recommended for a movie marathon
Nov 7 2022,positive,good movie it was fun alot of cool elements but it did not blow me away it also suffers from having some things in it that we as fans have already been exposed to from marvels movie overall i was satisfied and excited for the future
Nov 7 2022,positive,right out the comic book true story 100 percent best movie ever
Nov 7 2022,positive,went in expecting it to suck and was very happily surprised definitely not as good as man of steel or shazam for me but by far one of the best dc movies far better than what marvel has been putting out and makes me excited to see what else is in store humor is paced well with the normally comedic actor dwayne being much more serious with his only funny moments being his interaction with a kid action is solid but very throughout the movie so if you dont like action packed movies this might not be for you
Nov 7 2022,positive,really great dwayne johnson was perfect for the role
Nov 7 2022,positive,really love it very enjoyable
Nov 7 2022,negative,holes in the script and areas that just didnt seem to fit the narrative  poor acting and way too much boom boom without conversations to build the characters
Nov 7 2022,positive,the movie was really good i thought the last super hero movie i saw was love  thunder which i hated this one had some funny moments in it jsa was great the movie wasnt darkfilming like so many of the other movies and something i really dislike about other dc movies    i really liked how black adam is viewed by those outside of the his area and within his area and really sets up a very interesting character some of the cgi wasnt as crisp  clean as ive seen in other movies but very overall my wife and i loved it     my only problem was i felt the ending was rushed  i might have ended the movie a bit sooner i dont want give any spoilers and when there is a reveal that everything isnt as was thought would have been a great spot ending it setting up the big bad for another movie rather than introducing a sorta big bad only to defeat him in 10minutes    cant wait to see where dc is going next i loved the midpost credit scene i really have high hopes there is so many dc movies that should be great and lately marvel has jumped the shark so i hope dc gets it right
Nov 7 2022,positive,its better than i expected the story was decent but really wished the rock stuck to his characters accent like the rest of his people had the whole movie still had some corny moments but the story was good enough shoutout pierce brosnan loved him as dr fate
Nov 7 2022,positive,enjoyed the story the action and the ongoing conflict between good and evil casting was perfect
Nov 7 2022,positive,jokes were great and landed well it was lovely to see dwayne johnson acting professionally for the first time in a long while he did a great job the pacing was a bit too quick for my liking but the story was great regardless
Nov 7 2022,positive,good plot but too long and the actors lines were kinda corny
Nov 7 2022,negative,terrible movie painful to watch pierce bronson only fun part to watch
Nov 7 2022,negative,the movie is not as good as the audience score made it seem i gave a low score to adjust the high ratting
Nov 7 2022,positive,i think this is one of dcs best films in the past few years their movies had started to get cheesy and had bad acting and cgi i think black adam was dcs way of making a comeback it had great action emotion and just the right amount of comedy to make it a good action movie the comedy parts didnt seem forced like in aquaman and justice league
Nov 7 2022,positive,great movie  exhilarating action packed scenes that kept my attention  unexpected ending every legend has a beginning im looking forward to the sequel
Nov 7 2022,negative,a dour slog dwayne johnson at his most charmless and a supporting cast of dull sidekicks choppy editing saddled with pointless slow motion cinematography worst dc movie
Nov 7 2022,positive,really good  it was fun and the story was actually good too  the new characters were great  worth it to see it in the theatre
Nov 7 2022,negative,the movie was boring
Nov 7 2022,negative,roles that dwayne johnson plays are usually interesting the character development was presented in a way that was so complex it could not be understood yet it was so simple that it was not interesting i like action movies but there was too much action and not enough plot not enough genuine oneliners
Nov 7 2022,positive,i thought it was good one of the better dc movies ive seen yet
Nov 7 2022,positive,if i would rate this i would give it 80 i loved the action but there were some parts that could have been fleshed out a little more
Nov 7 2022,positive,finally dc gets a movie done right
Nov 7 2022,positive,it was a much better movie than what the critics were saying liked to see the justice society in a dc film
Nov 7 2022,positive,its a good bad movie
Nov 7 2022,positive,loved it  cant wait for a sequel
Nov 7 2022,positive,it has room for improvement but its a decent super hero film the rock was in his natural habitat with some cool action set pieces and decent visuals the problem was more on the pace and story it felt a little rush and some characters constantly keep saying some weak motivation or political speeches that just makes  your eyes roll in boredom if you ignore that and focus on the idea that black adam is more a anti hero that tries is best you can have fun watching it
Nov 7 2022,neutral,the script doesnt really make you care about any of the characters the editing and direction were kinda weird as well lots of cgi and there are so many scenes cut even the short dialogue has lots of cuts but it had its funny moments blackhawk and dr fate were cool and well made considering their short time to be developed
Nov 7 2022,positive,special effects were impressive and lots of action predictable story line
Nov 7 2022,negative,i didnt watch the movie my theatre screen shut off and they couldnt get it back on
Nov 7 2022,positive,great action movie very close to comic book you wont be disappointed i am anxious to see the next installment
Nov 7 2022,positive,action packed and tied in lots of dc threads the jsa amanda waller supes well done and worth seeing again
Nov 7 2022,positive,my boyfriend and loved it we can watch it over and over again
Nov 7 2022,positive,a lot of action nice movie
Nov 7 2022,positive,gotta see this movie its great lots of action
Nov 7 2022,positive,awesome action packed superhero movie plain and simple
Nov 7 2022,positive,whenever i do a movie review i check 4 things  writting directing acting and special effects the movie is great in all of those aspects the story explain the purpose of the complex character as an anti hero there is no big holes on it and its always attached to the main character  dc introduced the secondary heroes as expected in other words we need to save the world from a thing that we dont understand directing was fenomenal because you never lose the storyline and the battles were spectacular since the begining to the end of the movie  acting surprised me the most dwayne johnson is an underated actor that had showed his potencial in multiple proyects bringing pierce brosnan complemented the movie with his charisma but balancing the new actors with their part of this movie special effects are fenomenal in other words dc is going on the right path by forgetting the ridiculous wok agenda and bringing what the majority of the fans want to see in  a good movie black adam is definately a great movie and a most watch in theaters
Nov 7 2022,positive,the movie itself is funny comedy  action thrilling abd excitement

Nov 7 2022,positive,i really enjoyed the movie i thought hawkman aldis hodge was awesome and dwayne did a great job too he was born for this character the postcredit scene also gave me goosebumps
Nov 7 2022,positive,it had some genuinely comical moments worth watching some of the sequences looked cool other than that it was a messy plot and too cheesy overall
Nov 7 2022,positive,fantastic movie very exciting and such a diverse cast cant wait to see what dwayne does with the dc franchise
Nov 7 2022,positive,enjoyed the story line the characters the action and the special effects  great stuff humor was good but could have had a bit more dwayne johnson was terrific as usual
Nov 7 2022,positive,this film was mainly focuses on the hero aspect the films was still very entertaining to watch the main thing for me is that the time of the movie to have it make feel you have only sat down for five minutes it being as long as the movie was it felt like was five minutes
Nov 7 2022,neutral,had a lot of action which was cool to really see how powerful the characters were but it lacked character development and the villain was completely terrible
Nov 7 2022,negative,too much cgi and a plot thats somewhat unoriginal 2 hours run time felt too long editing couldve been better better off watching in the comfort of your home not a big screen movie
Nov 7 2022,negative,was a rip off of shazam all special effects little or no plot acting mediocre just very disappointing
Nov 7 2022,positive,loved the cast of actors and the plot  not much  not to like
Nov 6 2022,positive,amazing movie ignore the critics
Nov 6 2022,positive,pretty good allot of action secondary characters not needed
Nov 6 2022,positive,it had a strong opening but when it came to the third act it became over the top but overall still enjoyable the rock killed it in the role and the jsa was pretty damm cool
Nov 6 2022,positive,not a bad movie wife and i checked it out the movie had good action and special effects story line was okay but some jokes seem to miss
Nov 6 2022,positive,very well put together movie loved it
Nov 6 2022,positive,one of the best dc movies to come out lately packed with lots of action explosions and a good storyline the movie was well cast too
Nov 6 2022,positive,the movie takes us to a different dc universe with less budget and acceptable to the general public
Nov 6 2022,positive,great action and introductions to new characters
Nov 6 2022,negative,movie wasnt 2 hours like it said it was about an hr and 20 minutes i wasnt a fan it was ok
Nov 6 2022,neutral,i love the rock and he does a good job but the movie was too hoxie with characters that just dont  work demons and demigods with a mixture of futuristic tech and people fighting with sticks throw everything against the wall and see what sticks
Nov 6 2022,positive,a lot of action and some good one liners but the storyline was weak great redbox movie not todays matinee prices
Nov 6 2022,positive,definitely a good movie i can see an academy award and a video game the graphics are amazing 
Nov 6 2022,positive,theyre right antihero but nah he wont beat superman unless they de power kalel
Nov 6 2022,positive,solid movie but not great some jokes fall flat action sequences are very good great mid credits scene
Nov 6 2022,positive,the movie is wonderfully awesome i liked so much im waiting for the next movie with battle of the titans of justice
Nov 6 2022,positive,its dc trying to beat marvels juggernaut  it was entertaining but missing lots of details  i say give it a shot its not bad  but dc has the super heros and ability to do so much better and all we get is subpar movies chasing marvels tail
Nov 6 2022,positive,amazing movie from start to finish
Nov 6 2022,positive,its a fun movie dont take it too seriously
Nov 6 2022,positive,best dc movie in quite a while
Nov 6 2022,positive,47 really good movie
Nov 6 2022,positive,great movie awesome effects
Nov 6 2022,positive,great action throughout nice story
Nov 6 2022,positive,there has been amazing fighting scenes throughout the movie like the plot and introductions of the new characters the rock really fits in the role black adam
Nov 6 2022,positive,if i had to name the two strong points of the film i would say that they are its visual spectacle and the action that it offers especially in the fight scenes that i know will excite both fans and the general public although the story could be considered simple the truth is that this makes the film easy to follow for an audience unaffiliated to the character the interpretations of the justice society  is also a point to highlight althought its their first time in the big screen the truth is that they come to please the viewer and the actors have good chemistry among them especially aldis hodge and pierce brosnan who steal the movie in their scenes     as for dwayne johnson lets just say its like he was born to play black adam the impact and force he generates in his appearances feel so natural that its hard to think of another actor playing the character black adam is definitely what i needed to see explosions epic fights among superheroes and a story of becoming a hero and although it may not seem like it not everything in the movie is action there are also emotional scenes that will make you empathize with the character anyway what else is left for me to say but if you go to see it i assure you that you will not regret it and that the postcredits scene will surely leave you wanting to see what comes next for black adam
Nov 6 2022,negative,probably the worst of the year what a waste
Nov 6 2022,positive,great movie lots of action wasnt disappointed at all was refreshing to see something other than marvel stories never got bored definitely recommend
Nov 6 2022,positive,awesome movie johnson fit into the character perfectly great action movie that will have you cheering for for the villain
Nov 6 2022,positive,inconsistent plot and grab bag of cultural references were less than stellar  but beats cleaning the house
Nov 6 2022,positive,my family really enjoyed this movie i dont understand why it has such a low score in rotten tomatoes i think it was better than the last couple marvel movies
Nov 6 2022,positive,great movie good watch
Nov 6 2022,positive,fantastic storyline action and dj
Nov 6 2022,positive,super generic and felt kinda marvellike bad villain and bad dialogue other than that it was good only characters i felt for was doctor fate hackman and black adam movie shouldve left out everyone else honestly cause nobody else served a purpose action was amazing and some cool turns into the movie 
Nov 6 2022,neutral,it was ok a little over the top but kept my attention certainly not one of the best action hero movies but worthy of a watch on the big screen stay for the credits
Nov 6 2022,positive,good effects decent action fights but the plot falls short and is a bit predictable
Nov 6 2022,negative,might be the worst movie i have ever seen warner bros needs to stop making these terrible embarrassing super hero movies or stop letting under talented writers and directors get away with this dc comics owes us all a apology for this movie 
Nov 6 2022,positive,great action stick around after the credits you will ne surprised
Nov 6 2022,negative,they could have done more to develop the characters and made the plot less predictable      it is basically a generic superhero movie that relies on special effects explosions and slow motion to hide the lack of substance
Nov 6 2022,positive,always great to see a movie w the rock in it
Nov 6 2022,positive,great action  the story didnt steal aha hey boring like previous dc movies
Nov 6 2022,negative,quite possibly the worst movie ever written and acted  tons of fight scenes 11 plot lines and introductions to characters any moderately intelligent person couldnt relate to  awful
Nov 6 2022,positive,was a fun film and one of the better dc offerings but it overused slowmotion a lot
Nov 6 2022,positive,a superhero movie in this day and age that is unshackled from the pressures universebuilding is a fresh sight
Nov 6 2022,positive,a solid entertaining adventure but much like the eternals leaves you feeling kind of lacking this is dc though so a solid introorigin story for them i guess it no wonder woman but well dc so hit and miss each movie is a roll of the dice it seems the setting is strange like it some sort of parallel world to ours introducing a justice league type group  that has totally different unseen heros in it  to try to keep him in check then suddenly at the end here comes suicide squad bad mama  then even getting the attention of supermannice cameo for sure but think superman would struggle against this guy in a showdown should be fun to see his power shift the dynamic of the justice league going forward for sure the character is definitely part of the same power source as shazam so assume there will be more quality interactions with that whole story line going forward the rock joins the justice league thats the best casting dc has done for sure look forward to what comes next
Nov 6 2022,positive,it is full of action and is the best movie ever i love it and the ending when superman meets him is absolutely amazing i cant wait for number2
Nov 6 2022,positive,it was a good movie family orientated a bit of humorloved it
Nov 6 2022,positive,its okay took my boys not to exticed
Nov 6 2022,positive,action packed fast paced enjoyable movie
Nov 6 2022,positive,great movie  great action couple of funny scenes last villain was ok
Nov 6 2022,negative,dc has been on a roll this year and this one just barely keeps the train rolling johnson gave an okay performance as the titular character that has just enough fun and seriousness that it feels like an actual superhero film and not some low tier comedy like other superhero films this year brosnan gave a performance that really leaves you wanting more
Nov 6 2022,positive,this movie was captivating it had me on the edge of my seat i loved all the superhero characters the storyline was meaningful
Nov 6 2022,positive,dc finally did a great job definitely a must see
Nov 6 2022,positive,great entertainment but not up to the level of the majority of marvel movies the rock was good
Nov 6 2022,positive,i thought the film was good but the other characters they introduced were not referred by as the justice league i think the character can be developed more looking forward to a sequel
Nov 6 2022,positive,for a movie that was 2 hours it felt a lot longer than that
Nov 6 2022,negative,i took my entire family including 2 kids  the movie makes no sense too much drama  dc is loosing its grip on super hero fatigue
Nov 6 2022,positive,great movie rock was awesome
Nov 6 2022,positive,amazing sgi and scenes good balance of funny and action the cast and directors should be very happy with themselves
Nov 6 2022,negative,totally absurd movie cmon
Nov 6 2022,positive,was entertaining and a fun watch
Nov 6 2022,positive,loved it it wasnt perfect but is setting dc in a pretty fun direction remember its a comic book movie not an oscar nominee
Nov 6 2022,positive,great characters nonstop action with a well built drama in it the humor is a nice touch although the jsa is not given that much background their members are excellently portrayed specially brosnans drfate lots of fun easter eggs and a story which keeps you invested the villain feels powerful and intimidating as well as the main antihero totally a must see movie
Nov 6 2022,positive,was totally entertained
Nov 6 2022,negative,worst movie ever i wanted to get up and go get my money back they needed a couple big names to show up in the movie viola davis and the rock but basically just a ploy for a bad spinoff pierce brosnan was good loved him the rock cant act period story was ok action i guess ok seems like they just copied marvel characters cyclone is storm atom small is antman hawkman is same everyone was bored on their phones thats how lame it was i hope they dont plan on doing another one i wouldnt go see it
Nov 6 2022,positive,loved itwould be worth it just to see superman but the movie itself is one of the better from dcblack adam doctor fate and hawkman are all amazingreally worth the watchten times better than anything marvel has done in the past three years
Nov 6 2022,positive,inlived it my friend and i went we both enjoyed it a lot all the characters and black adam clicked was also pretty funny but done in a good way great movie imo enjoy it for what it is a good fun time
Nov 6 2022,positive,the movie was dope gotta watch it again them so called critics need to do something else for reals
Nov 6 2022,positive,it was a nice watch a good amount of action and nicely paced story telling the characters were fun to watch and it had the right amount of humor to lighten otherwise dense and dark moments they didnt introduce to many characters the rock gave what is expected a good show of power and attitude i would have given 5 stars but the final act dragged on a bit and felt slower than the rest of the movie it really didnt even seem nessecary would have been a great story without it and kept it open to a wider audience
Nov 6 2022,neutral,its a one time watch movie not impressed with the screenplay  story eccept action scene
Nov 6 2022,positive,best movie of the year by far honestly it was so good ive seen it twice in the cinemas already and i would still go back for more
Nov 6 2022,positive,came in moderately cautious came out absolutely impressed by this film    tired of vanilla superheroes that have a 3year olds concept of good and bad and never kill well the first 3 minutes of onscreen black adam gives you a decent kill count to start with    tired of an abundance of characters out of which none is perfectly defined well black adam revolves around a handful and takes just enough time to flesh out each one    once again profesional critics prove they are completely disconnected from what people want to see or maybe they didnt get paid to write good reviews    do yourself a favor  go watch black adam
Nov 6 2022,positive,the script could have been better the cameo at the end was awesome
Nov 6 2022,positive,movie started out pretty fast without digging too deep into the story but then they explained the story and when they did the throne scene like the comics that was dope
Nov 6 2022,positive,much better than expected
Nov 6 2022,negative,will never again pay a 239 convince fee  our you stupid enough to use a site to pay for mivie tickets that charges ridiculous fees like this
Nov 6 2022,positive,my husband and i enjoyed the movie so much and made it more interesting to watch in 4d it was a good combination of action humor and very little drama which is good overall great experience
Nov 6 2022,positive,the rock being great as usual black adam being op as he should be a nice movie that wrapped up its story and all its characters smoothly it aint the breakthroughmovie of the century but it sure as hell was entertaining
Nov 6 2022,positive,i got a thrill of the film its non stop action
Nov 6 2022,positive,im a bit tired of the rock as of late but this turned out well i enjoyed the story and the action the effects were pretty decent had a good cast overall too
Nov 6 2022,positive,just watched this yesterday i love how black adam progressively shows more humane feeling throughout the movie while still going about things his own way 10s across the board
Nov 6 2022,positive,was a fun movie not perfect but definitely enjoyed it
Nov 6 2022,positive,loved the movie the theatre room could have been a bit cleaner but otherwise my husband and i hade a fun date night

Nov 6 2022,positive,so much better then i had expected  wow this was great
Nov 6 2022,positive,love it cant wait to see how black adam and superman will react to each other
Nov 6 2022,positive,overall a great movie entertaining and great special effects  humour and action balanced perfectly  there were 2 seniors 2 adults 35ish and 5 kids and we all enjoyed black adam  5 star from all of us
Nov 6 2022,neutral,although they are not in the dceu bales batman phoenixs joker and pattinsons batman movies are the only dcish movies that get you to care about the characters  anything with the dceu fails to get you to care  black adam is the latest proof
Nov 6 2022,positive,the rock did his thing no doubt
Nov 6 2022,positive,very entertaining with humor an action whats not to love
Nov 6 2022,positive,i like the story line of how he became blk adam loved they had other super heroes in the movie had alot of actionwhich i love in a marvel movie must go see at movies get full effect
Nov 6 2022,positive,non stop action good
Nov 6 2022,positive,not a big fan of dc but this movie truly changed my mind cheesy and funny at the best points not completely predictable this movies comes with a fresh definition of antiheroes in the superhero franchise
Nov 6 2022,positive,loved the rock in it worth it just to see him
Nov 6 2022,positive,it was great really enjoyed it looking forward to future projects
Nov 6 2022,positive,better than expected good action
Nov 6 2022,positive,enjoyed the movie greatly with my kid
Nov 6 2022,positive,the origin narrative is confusing but the visuals and action are good for theaters wonder how he knows english given hes a 5000 year old but lets forego that point for now also supes
Nov 6 2022,positive,the action scenes were really good but thats about it the story is sloppy the acting kinda lame the rock is a magnetic personality but he cant really act
Nov 6 2022,positive,enjoyable good action flow
Nov 6 2022,positive,the movie was action packed and comical all throughout the entirety of it the cast played their part very well i would go see the movie over and over again just because it was that good
Nov 6 2022,positive,finally dc made a good movie the whole cast did a wonderful job and the whole thing just felt fresh was pleasantly surprised i had a blast looking forward to dc starting over on a positive note
Nov 6 2022,positive,this movie was amazing i would definitely recommend watching it 
Nov 6 2022,positive,it was meh it had its moments dwaine never says hes black adam he always calls himself men in black which i think is a copy right
Nov 6 2022,negative,i wish i knew it was a movie about demons i thought it was a super hero movie had to walk out with my kids maybe advertise that part and not just the cute funny  patrs
Nov 6 2022,positive,so so good kept us entertained the whole way through 1010 would recommend this movie
Nov 6 2022,positive,great movie good story great twist funny and post credit made me excited for next movie
Nov 6 2022,positive,awesome  best dc movie in a while
Nov 6 2022,positive,action drama humor and a touch of romance
Nov 6 2022,positive,he did dc fans justice slow start enjoyed it look forward to seeing him link up in zack synders verse
Nov 6 2022,neutral,when i have to start by saying the credit scene is the best part of the movie i think it clearly states how good the movie is or is not full of plot holes forced tension wasted characters and weak story telling tons of action and overthetop special effects  the character of black adam has a rich and nuanced background that is largely wasted the jsa has an equally rich history completely wasted i wished for more got a lot less maybe next time they will spend time fleshing out the story and not so much on the fx
Nov 6 2022,positive,this movie was awesome
Nov 6 2022,positive,it was really good one of the better dc movies to come out the visuals were great and of course the rock is a enjoyable to watch give it a chance watch it your going to want to see it in theaters the action scenes were amazingly shot 
Nov 6 2022,positive,was a good movie not great action scenes were good too many slomo scenes for me
Nov 6 2022,positive,a little low on story but high on action
Nov 6 2022,positive,i liked the black adam story  but i didnt care for the jsa characters were pretty dull  i thought this could have been a black adam movie buy itself then involving the jsa  hope to see black adam again to start more stuff
Nov 6 2022,positive,really enjoyed this movie  i thought the rock did great playing a vengeful put of time allpowerful demigod   the story was serviceable and the supporting cast did well   could have left some of the brothers jokey scenes out but they were mostly fine cant wait to see more from the rocks dc influence
Nov 6 2022,positive,likewish the movie had more action
Nov 6 2022,positive,oml i really love this movie and black adam is my new favorite dc character i highly recommend you to watch this
Nov 6 2022,positive,couldve shown some boobies or something idk
Nov 6 2022,positive,what i liked about is that it was very funny and badass kick and drama
Nov 6 2022,positive,movie was good theater seat didnt work at all and they were assignedselected seats
Nov 6 2022,positive,action packed with just the right amount of humor thrown in
Nov 6 2022,positive,this should definitely be on the list of the rock guilty pleasure movies
Nov 6 2022,positive,it was an ok movie looking forward to the second one
Nov 6 2022,positive,oh my god it was fun  it was a great cgi great action love the story i im ready to see it again dont listen to the critics and the naysayers
Nov 6 2022,positive,it was a lot of fun it wasnt as bad as ive been hearing it set up a lot of things in their dc universe that im looking forward to for a second i thought i was watching a ratedr movie the ending section was a little weak and contrived how could regular people women and children fight back against those things and the effects with the ship could have been better xmen came out 20 years ago and that had better effects in many cases the entire movie felt more like a tv show special than a movie but it was still fun
Nov 6 2022,positive,absolutely awesome action really great humor that wasnt overused and although the trailer spoiled some of the supposedly hidden background the movie was still a blast to watch remember to stay for the end credits scene
Nov 6 2022,positive,i like this movie initially i wanted the primary villain to fight a little longer and started to lose track of it i eventually got the hang of it but other than that it was excellent i also loved the ending credits
Nov 6 2022,positive,great movie much better than anything marvel has done lately its not perfect but its a good time and very fun to watch
Nov 6 2022,positive,really enjoyed the movie
Nov 6 2022,positive,awesome movie  the rock did a great job portraying black adam
Nov 6 2022,positive,far more fun thank i expected going into it possibly the best dc movie ive seen but doesnt mean the bar is that high
Nov 6 2022,positive,action the heros great choices the rock excellent
Nov 6 2022,positive,the critics who watched and scored this movie are very like my dad they put me down and point out my flaws no matter how small to a large group of people and like my dad they missed the whole point of why i exist this is a good movie its got a cool brand new group of heros set in a place that aint america for once as well as sets up some very interesting future materials does it have its issues yes some side characters need work alota work also the big bad guy wasnt really that bad and scary i mean i knew he was gona get a worse beat down than i did for asking my dad if he loved me but aside from the problems the movie has its overall theme and idea was good i will recommend this to my 98 year old nanny to watch she loves big buff bald superheros so its right up her street
Nov 6 2022,positive,great action good original story likable characters very satisfying ending
Nov 6 2022,negative,it was too longbut the two 12 years old boys i took loved it
Nov 6 2022,positive,great movie great store a lot of action
Nov 6 2022,positive,the hand gesture to rally the people was very corny especially toward the end of the movie  script could have been better but at least its better than the other dc movies
Nov 6 2022,positive,entertaining and a thrilling ride it does has fault such as the dialogue and plot but overall it was a fun watch
Nov 6 2022,positive,action comedy you can never go wrong with the rock best hero action movie ever
Nov 6 2022,positive,the movie was great relaxing seats clean and comfortable
Nov 6 2022,positive,if you like dc films you might like but if you know the comic book characters you will enjoy it more easy to watch and easy to enjoy if with like minded friends or family
Nov 6 2022,positive,enjoy it for what it is instead of listening to all the zombies out there
Nov 6 2022,positive,emax theater at canton emagine was an amazing experience
Nov 6 2022,positive,a lot better than i expected frankly not perfect by any means and a little slow to get going but gives the requisite action and even manages to provoke thought on occasion
Nov 6 2022,positive,a breath of fresh air in the dc movie universe it reminded me of the very successful dc animated universe they didnt pull any punches and the rock was amazing as this character i hope the wb ignore the haters in the movie biz and listen to us we love it keep it up
Nov 5 2022,positive,it was great the special effects top notch
Nov 5 2022,positive,for me this move felt flat i had very high expectations but once again was disappointed hope part 2 is much better with the introduction of superman
Nov 5 2022,positive,great jokes throughout love the action and special effects
Nov 5 2022,positive,we liked everything about it  great action special effects and neat story line  violent so caution about taking young children
Nov 5 2022,positive,if rotten tomatoes dont like the movie is good
Nov 5 2022,negative,the rock was good the actors were good the storyline twisted in a way to justify oppression  even after all is done he is still the enemy dumb write
Nov 5 2022,positive,lots of action from beginning to end dwayne johnson did great as well as the other actors
Nov 5 2022,negative,its dc so it is usually not good
Nov 5 2022,positive,absolutely loved it cast was perfect it was great to see all the characters on the silver screen
Nov 5 2022,positive,was a pretty fun movie a lot of action doesnt shy aware from how brutal black atom is the pacing is a bit off towards the middle which was my only gripe    love that all the characters were comic book accurate particularly fate and hawkman
Nov 5 2022,positive,critics dont know movies this was a great movie its a shame that some people might not go due to poor ratings  its definitely worth seeing dont miss it
Nov 5 2022,neutral,not great  good cast modern special effects just not very exciting  every superhero movie looks just like the next  there was nothing here to set this movie apart  it felt very unsatisfying
Nov 5 2022,positive,black adam was just as advertised fun all out action pack comic book on the big screen my daughters and i enjoyed it one of the best dc films so far 
Nov 5 2022,positive,i havent been this excited since man of steel a rush from start to finish looking forward to what the future hold for this series
Nov 5 2022,positive,one of the best movies yet lots of celebrities in it and watch the ending it was great too theres going to be another one yes
Nov 5 2022,positive,the hero movie the world has been waiting for i seriously cannot wait for more everyone who has a soul should buy theater tix
Nov 5 2022,positive,a good thing these years of bad things recommend
Nov 5 2022,positive,my kids and i enjoyed it to the max
Nov 5 2022,positive,excellent movie and action packed from start to end will watch again next week
Nov 5 2022,negative,what a mess they tried to recreate everything that has been done in superhero films this makes this movie feel incoherent so you dont know exactly what it is trying to be the story is been pushed as fast as possible with really fast cuts and cheesy dialog  as with other recent films of this genre the visual effects seem cheap for what could be done when we talk about a blockbuster like this  given how violence was a big deal in the movie it would have seemed appropriate to make it r rated but its understandable that almost no one is brave enough to do that so all the killing feels more like a joke  not sure if it was because of the lame development of the story but the million jokes just didnt really made it entertaining
Nov 5 2022,positive,this is why you go watch movies and not listen to someones opinion especially people like critics who get to see movies for free only opinion that matters is us fans cus its our money and lets be honest we are all critics so anyone can give an opinion on that note get out and support and watch black adam
Nov 5 2022,positive,very nice i like the movie just sad about the guy that died in the ending
Nov 5 2022,positive,great cant wait for the next one
Nov 5 2022,negative,boring  too much cgi and not enough good script  why did the rock act like one  he blew all his lighthearted lines  seemed like he didnt want to be in the film
Nov 5 2022,positive,one of the top dc movies so far imho there was plenty of comedic moments though there were some missed opportunities there was little in the realm of characterbuilding as still by the end of the film there was little empathy for the main support characters or their story in the end it was just great to see the rock blow stuff up
Nov 5 2022,positive,i had no reference to whom the characters were or what marvel or other franchise they are from  im not much of a sifi kind of person so it was very boring  i want to see real people and background not digitally created people etc
Nov 5 2022,positive,best comic film since marvels endgame dc future looks very promising
Nov 5 2022,positive,best movie ive seen all year and didnt put me to sleep at the movies i dont leave reviews often but definitely recommend
Nov 5 2022,positive,not sure what it was just a borderline move for me i usually really like the rock movies
Nov 5 2022,positive,very good action packed hero movie
Nov 5 2022,positive,the rock is buff 
Nov 5 2022,positive,really loved this i grew up reading shazam and hawkman so this really was a good time for me and my sons loved seeing the jsa on the big screen albeit a mock up version of it  but still great all the same the rock really nailed adam  hawkman was not really explored so i dont know which version we got egyptian or thanagal but pierce was a pleasant surprise as dr fate now the bad guy was something to be desired to be honest but he served his purpose and of course cavill is back as superman
Nov 5 2022,positive,very action  packed me and my son seen it and it was awesome
Nov 5 2022,positive,this movie is absolutely amazing i think black adam is stronger god of the dc universe
Nov 5 2022,positive,genuinely surprised with how much i enjoyed this film definitely think the dceu is heading in the right direction and the rock fits the role exceptionally well
Nov 5 2022,positive,35 rounded up thought it to be a good bridge between the snyderverse and the shazamssaquaman style  i thought they could have leaned into dr fate a little more but had fun and looked forward to the next outing
Nov 5 2022,positive,best superhero movie since last spiderman and ive seen them all
Nov 5 2022,positive,love it not what you expect
Nov 5 2022,positive,a solid 65 and decent modern superhero firstgoround or origin story please adjust for 25 inflation to review score due to an increase in the quality of film see operation raccoon city for more detailed explanation 
Nov 5 2022,positive,rotten tomatoes needs new critics one of the best super hero movies ever
Nov 5 2022,positive,finally a good guy who doesnt mind killing the ending after the credits makes it even better
Nov 5 2022,positive,it was very creative in the overall storyline and the costumes it held my attention the whole time
Nov 5 2022,positive,went with my grandson  it was ok for me great for him   a little to long
Nov 5 2022,positive,pretty good action packed the justice regrade or whatever they were called were kinda whack but overall movie was entertaining not bad even though i think the rock is an overrated actor who plays the same person every movie but yeah bravo haha
Nov 5 2022,positive,loved that it was light hearted kept my wife and i laughing and entertained the entire movie
Nov 5 2022,positive,dwayne the rock johnson does an epic performance as black adam pierce brosnan did an amazing job playing dr fate the music and visualization is amazing this deserves more praise and shows dc is going in the right path
Nov 5 2022,positive,it was fun and the rock was the perfect actor for the role but the movie was too much a justice society intro and not enough black adam  like other dc movies you can clearly tell they have a complete lack of focus and are not willing to spend the time to develop a character or topic standalone and instead clutter the movie with way too many other characters in my opinion they should have done the justice society movie first as a standalone to get all that out of the way so that we wouldnt be spending time developing those characters
Nov 5 2022,positive,overall id give it a solid b  good pacing decent story  dramatic irony was present but not overbearing or obvious  there were some scenes at the end scenes without the rock in them where they clearly ran out of money and just did what they could get away with
Nov 5 2022,positive,had low expectations because of the critics and came out thinking this is the best superhero movie of 2021 and 2022 this is how cbm should be made mcu take some notes
Nov 5 2022,positive,fantastic one of the best superhero movies made in years hope we get more of this in the future black adam dont have strings with the political correctness and neither the woke agenda people need descendent movies like this
Nov 5 2022,positive,a refreshing spin in the dc universe very action packed and i have to admit dwayne johnson absolutely smashed the role hands down one of the best dc films hang tight for the end credits scene
Nov 5 2022,positive,it was ok some of the fight sequences were too long and smasher is corny  character selection could have been better  black adams back story could have been developed a bit more  i did however enjoy pierce brosnans presence in the movie
Nov 5 2022,positive,it was action packed and exciting but cheesy weak villain with pointless actions the end credit scene was 1010 tho
Nov 5 2022,neutral,to many fight scene couldnt follow the story i am online giving it two and a half stars because a certain super hero shows up before the end credits
Nov 5 2022,positive,absolutely fantastic  one of the best dc movies alongside man of steel the geniality behind the playful way they manage the roles of antagonist and protagonist is so refreshing  the appearance of new characters is also very entertaining it feels familiar but also new some of them were not very useful to the plot others definitely demand movies of their own  the cgi was also well done in my opinion it had impact and was very convincing i dont think it felt rushed at all contrary to the recent mcu movies
Nov 5 2022,positive,was ok expected more though
Nov 5 2022,positive,absolutely phenomenal movie critics are stupid this movie was well past expectations and hope for another movie
Nov 5 2022,positive,movie was great loved the acting and action it was a little hard to follow at times and dj was over acting in some areas but over all loved it
Nov 5 2022,neutral,like most marvel movies it was long as hell  the cinematics were great but i dont have to see it again  even with the rock and aldis hodge in it  lol
Nov 5 2022,neutral,while ww84 suffers from a lack of action black adam finds itself facing the exact opposite problem its a failed attempt to compensate for a weak story underdeveloped characters and an uninteresting villain that being said it isnt the worst dc movie ive seen
Nov 5 2022,positive,good story good action
Nov 5 2022,positive,i loved it a lot of energy excellent effects
Nov 5 2022,positive,in ancient kahndaq teth adam was bestowed the almighty powers of the gods after using these powers for vengeance he was imprisoned becoming black adam nearly 5000 years have passed and black adam has gone from man to myth to legend  amusing humor and a very entertaining performance from the rock consolidate black adam as one of the strongest dceu outings
Nov 5 2022,positive,excellent movie for me the best of the year of superheroes that the socalled critics do not like it it does not matter everyone is free to think what they want those who did not like it should make their own movie because they have to understand that all tastes are not the same
Nov 5 2022,positive,its quite enough different than industrial superhero movies and its have a different tone its a bit long but i recommend
Nov 5 2022,positive,straight forward plot with a couple of holes but i had a blast watching it
Nov 5 2022,negative,so disappointing  the story and writing was terrible  very cheesy almost comical no pun intended  no character development  the setting made no sense   its obvious the studio was targeting 8 year olds  there used to be super hero movies that both adults and their kids could enjoy  this isnt one of them great special effects though but thats about it
Nov 5 2022,positive,enjoyable superhero action flick fun for the whole family who doesnt like watching dwayne johnson kick butt for a few hours
Nov 5 2022,positive,was really awesome so much action and combat the rock still has that same attitude lol
Nov 5 2022,positive,we really enjoyed this one it was nice to see a dc movie with cinematography that wasnt as dark the casting was really good also nothing felt forced looking forward to the next one
Nov 5 2022,positive,great comic book movies have always had an undertone tackling social issues black adam not only attempts that but gives you a relentless comic book character not afraid to use his brute strength  where the plot perhaps could have been neater the movie makes up for in its action sequences borrowing from some of the greatest comic book sequences shot such as the memorable quick silver in x men overall a good stepping stone for the future of dc with certain critiques being left feeling uncomfortable at the rejection of the savior complex being highlighted in the movie
Nov 5 2022,positive,i thought this movie was action packed with great cgi this movie didnt have one second where i was bored the movie wasnt all over the place like people said and it made sense     b
Nov 5 2022,positive,very fun movie to watch with the family
Nov 5 2022,positive,it was very funny  and especially that part where they  you should stay away from electricity 
Nov 5 2022,negative,found the plot dumb and boring no substance
Nov 5 2022,positive,awesome movie with great storyline feel confident where dj is gonna help direct the dceu
Nov 5 2022,positive,it was a solid movie some of the dialogue drug it along but the action was good
Nov 5 2022,negative,it was awful no story line i had a group of marvel fans and they hated the movie huge disappointment
Nov 5 2022,negative,zero to sixty in a short amount of time not a superhero movie watcher normally but i thought what the heck bad move convoluted and far reaching
Nov 5 2022,negative,disappointing lack of character development with a villain that no one cares about basically fast and the furious with dc characters
Nov 5 2022,positive,best dc superhero movie yet the rock is awesome as black adam looking forward to see where things go from here
Nov 5 2022,positive,amazing this is exactly what dc universe needed
Nov 5 2022,positive,went in to the movie without much expectations and it delivered fairly okay black adam is simple and straight forward you dont need to follow the comic books for the backstory of black adam though its so predictable but was a fair entertainer dwayne johnson seemed to be the perfect cast as black adam and he delivered it well but there is something missing from the movie whole total villain was not so powerful in terms of the depth of his character and the marwan kensari was okayish graphics was good but most of the scenes were like inspired from marvels which was a total letdown action choreography was outstanding comedy timing worked out really well another letdown of the movie was lorne balfes background score in fact it didnt leave any impact whole total except the closing score     all in whole a simple popcorn entertainer which is not so great  watchable    7 on 10
Nov 5 2022,positive,it was great how the justice society and superman came up in the movie and how learn the story of the missing person from the shazam story and learn black adam became him but overall the story was very dull because they were talking moving from one normal villian to a freaking demon and the story was really dark
Nov 5 2022,negative,it was horrible most of the characters were very similar to marvel characters etc atom smasher deadpoolantman doctor fate doctor strange hawkman the falcon cyclonestorm   the storyline makes no sense with the rock in the movie so i dont recommend watching the movie
Nov 5 2022,negative,does not have a message or does not deliver it well  pspipes are op
Nov 5 2022,positive,just awesome keep this momentum dc
Nov 5 2022,positive,i liked the action and all the movie affects
Nov 5 2022,positive,loved it cant wait for 2
Nov 5 2022,positive,a lot better than i had anticipated it to be
Nov 5 2022,negative,schlock not good wasted my time watch the rock float around and frown is what it should have been called
Nov 5 2022,positive,i love the movie and the actor two thumbs up
Nov 5 2022,positive,tons of action loved the plot twists towards the end
Nov 5 2022,positive,i just got home from watching the movie it was amazing and powerful huge shift from what dc has been producing action packed and it was actually funny on a serious note get ready for a real superhero that you can take seriously wow
Nov 5 2022,positive,fun and entertaining
Nov 5 2022,neutral,nice action but i dont understand the story
Nov 5 2022,negative,terrible movie terrible storytelling terrible cast terrible superheroes boring poorly represented and copy pasted from other marvel movies really i wasted my time and money
Nov 5 2022,positive,wonderfully told story
Nov 5 2022,positive,5 stars wish it spanned a few films enjoyed it had moments of uhhohh this is dark but gosh really sweet ending great work good laughs along the way too 
Nov 5 2022,positive,effects plot and ending think a little too much but great effects good job
Nov 5 2022,positive,great movie to watch 
Nov 5 2022,positive,it wasnt horrible but definitely not as great as rating over here by noncritics in middle of the movie it got somewhat boring to watch i felt that they are copied multiple characters from marvel like dr who resemblance was obvious in the magician guy the main villain is silly probably they made for teenagers or kids some devil type of character plot just wants there it had some moments but it felt like multiple pieces and characters are stitched together i would say 1 out of 10 is 65
Nov 5 2022,positive,lots of action right from the start
Nov 5 2022,positive,so lets get this straight this isnt your regular run of the mill dwyane johnson film rather then take the same regular route of an action hero he plays a dark brooding anti hero he plays black adam perfectly keeping much of what the character is with in the comics it was honestly surprising to see him take on this kind of role but i loved it   he wasnt the only part that made this movie enjoyable he is joined by an all star cast most portraying there characters incredibly well pierce brosnan as dr fate was by far an ideal choice and hawk man was surprisingly well played the same can not be said about some of the other super powered cast this is where the movie tended to spin out of control and went into the realm of what dc keeps doing that fails to impress there audience     rather then make the title character stand out and maybe fight a few bad guys in this case it should have been good guys they made a team honestly dc stop overloading your movies with more and more characters just to extend the movie i found i didnt enjoy the addition of i cant even remember there names spin move and grow guy adam smasher i found that their addition was very pointless and they struggled to have any screen time where as doctor fate and hawk man they were really enjoyable and probably should have been the main enemy for black adam you did the usual and over casted which is becoming a staple and a draw back     on the bright side youve learnt from previous mistakes by not makeing the movies so dark you cant see anything by takeing a more light hearted approach one that was very appreciated in this movie and you made the action scenes bad ass somewhat takeing notes from thor ragnarok and implying them here     overall i feel this is a must watch this year one full of fun for future movies take a similar approach but really focus on the writing of the story and do not overload it
Nov 5 2022,positive,this movie did everything youd expect from a super hero movie and did it really freaking well i dont need to be moved to tears on the first feature for a character i would like to be kept interested and entertained which i was fit every second
Nov 5 2022,negative,ive never seen a more cookie cutter superhero movie might as well have been written by hallmark
Nov 5 2022,positive,this movie is awesome
Nov 5 2022,positive,its not going to win any awards but this was a  very entertaining action packed movie i would definitely watch this movie more than once
Nov 5 2022,positive,like the story it remind me a lot of marvel universe really cool movie
Nov 5 2022,positive,loved this movie much better than the critics say
Nov 5 2022,positive,well made and action packed movie  cant understand the criticism
Nov 5 2022,positive,nothing specialat all the storyline dragged the acting was mid there were a couple of funny partsbut this movie was nothing special or memorable
Nov 5 2022,positive,best action movie of the year
Nov 5 2022,positive,i liked it  im not saying it was some ground breaking film but it was a lot of fun  it has lots of great action and some good writing  they do a great job with the black adam character  definitely worth the watch
Nov 5 2022,positive,pretty good better than the reviews
Nov 5 2022,negative,remember when america made awesome movies this is not one of them
Nov 5 2022,neutral,its venom of dceu movies
Nov 5 2022,positive,thought it was great  took my son 2 times to see the movie
Nov 5 2022,positive,this was one of the better dc movies  was good to see other heroes blended in as well as a healthy dose of comedy
Nov 5 2022,negative,terrible acting cringe dialogues  chaotic storytelling movie needs a director and creative head to live up to its potential
Nov 5 2022,positive,fun with a surpise appearance mid credit
Nov 5 2022,positive,good movie much better than the last thor
Nov 5 2022,positive,solid and funny action movie bonus enjoyment for dc fans but not essential for enjoyment kinda fun to see the rock play the bad guy for once
Nov 5 2022,positive,loved the rock hes been a super hero since he started but never utilized premise is decent but he makes the movie
Nov 5 2022,positive,the movie was perfectly done and the story was very good put together  i loved it
Nov 5 2022,positive,the makings of an epic crossover superhero film let down by messy pacing and lack of focus on characters
Nov 5 2022,positive,i really enjoyed this movie full of action i really dont understand why they hate black adam so much hes the best kinda of super hero
Nov 5 2022,positive,definitely one of the better dc movies there were some effects and style choices that definitely made you realize it wasnt to marvel caliber but overall it was a very enjoyable movie
Nov 5 2022,positive,i dont believe this crp by the professional critiques look at the obvious difference between audience and critiques rating sure at a pro level they look for god knows what to decide their ratings on but come on 2 stars if its any woke marvel crap you be forcing a 10 star in a 5 star scale i liked it its a serious movie with a few light hearted moments that really made the movie i have no background knowledge of who or what black adam is so i went in with a clean blank slate with very low expectations why cos of all your crap pro critiques saying how bad it was and lo and behold it was really good to me and i dont mean the action sequence the special effects etc i mean the storytelling its not overly complicated its acceptable levels logic vs illogical didnt spend a tonne of time on over complicated origin story and the greatest part of it is that its not woke at all anyway 5 stars go watch it without being stained by anyones opinion it meets all my criteria of a good movie entertaining and fun to watch
Nov 5 2022,positive,special effects were fantastic
Nov 5 2022,positive,this was fine the backstorycharacter arc for him was well done wouldve preferred this a shazaam movie before branching off but not a deal breaker
Nov 5 2022,negative,boring and slow to get into action too much worthless dialogue  poor casting  ripped off a lot of scenes from other marvel movies  main bad guy cgi was poor very poor looked like a 90s video game villain cutscene i would not watch it again unless they paid me to do so
Nov 5 2022,positive,the graphics and power pack action is amazing
Nov 5 2022,positive,very entertaining dc has finally added another superhero to its lineup that packs a punch
Nov 5 2022,positive,i liked the comedy in it
Nov 5 2022,positive,one of the best super hero movies ever
Nov 5 2022,positive,it was kinda meh i dont regret seeing it in the theater but would recommend against it
Nov 5 2022,positive,its hilarious how the critics just dont understand the movie it was just super fun and a fantastic experience
Nov 5 2022,positive,astonished by dwayne doing far below his sympathetic standard sometimes i was thinking hes doing faces and postures that dont fit the plot or hes trying to give a different meaning to black adam than i expected the plot quite a carousalambra i had a confusing feedback from this movie its on theaters for a while maybe gotta watch it again   when youre confused it may be because something doesnt work in it or you didnt work well while trying to understand the meaning of it i recommend it anyway a movie that makes you wonder deserves an analysis
Nov 5 2022,positive,i enjoyed my time at the movies and that is basically what i am going for each time i get a movie ticket i recommend 
Nov 5 2022,positive,i loved the special effects and the inspiration dwayne rock johnson provided in the movie  the plot was thought provoking
Nov 5 2022,positive,just saw black adam and really enjoyed it  the characters were amazing especially pierce brosnans dr fate loved hawkmans passion and fury  atom smasher was just the right amount of comedy and his uncle al pratt was a nice surprise  cyclone was colorful and charismatic  and black adam carried the show  now if i had listened to all the negative reviews and hadnt gone to see it i would have made a huge mistake  comparing all of the new dc character with marvel heroes was lazy writing  i was surprised that they didnt say superman was a thor ripoff all the negative reviews seemed orchestrated with the same criticisms and insults  reminded me of the hatchet job most of these same reviewers did on bvsdoj why do they insist on reviewing every superhero movie through a marvel lens  all that does is give credibility to the common fan complaint that these critics are in disneymarvels back pocket  im sure they will all fawn over the next black panther movie and get behind it like they did with the first bp will they criticize the introduction of new characters without their own movie first like they did with the justice society characters  doubt it  will they complain about the overuse of cgi action scenes again doubt it will they actually review black panther wakanda forever  nope just puffball love notes one reviewer called black adam one of the worst movies of the year  and yet that same reviewer loved thor love and thunder  go figure another reviewer referred to dr fate as a dollar store dr strange  will he call namor a dollar store aquaman highly doubt it since hes a huge marvel lover  and it seems to me that there was a bring down the rock vibe to the negative reviews complaining about his acting and a where was the rocks charisma complaints  he was playing a bad guy which means he was acting  his charisma was definitely there and how a supposedly educated writer can complain about not understanding the storyline is just stunning black adam was well written directed performed and it explained all the heroes and the situation in which they found themselves it is a good movie with a great aftercredits scene i recommend you go see it with an open mind and try to just sit back and enjoy the ride  something the majority of movie critics didnt do or werent willing to do  i think its latter when the marvelloving critics go see a dc movie
Nov 5 2022,positive,i personally thought this movie was pretty good and dc did a good job on black adam the rock was really good in this movie and i really liked piers brosnan as doctor fate
Nov 5 2022,neutral,even with the expectedly grim dc take on comic book characters i was surprised at how little charisma dwayne johnson was given license to produce
Nov 4 2022,positive,fun action packed def glad they stick with the same vibefeel as shazam the rock been striking out lately so glad to see this wasnt a bust cant wait for him and shazam to be on the same screen if youre expecting the dark somberquietemo feel of previous dc films this aint it which is good
Nov 4 2022,positive,i dont care about the critic reviews obviously i enjoyed this movie 
Nov 4 2022,positive,it was quite good  at times it was a bit hard to keep track of everything but it was still very good  i enjoyed it
Nov 4 2022,positive,the storyline and the action was put together really well  kudos to all the actors well done cant wait to see the next chapter
Nov 4 2022,positive,while it has great action and great performances from the rock and pierce brosnan the villain could have been better
Nov 4 2022,positive,the movie is great its way past my expected way to reveal new characters
Nov 4 2022,negative,dc just cant make anything work the dialog is painful and the story line was obvious     the graphic were the only good thing about this movie
Nov 4 2022,positive,it was great not too much woke and cringe good action good story good characters few bad acting scenes but still worth the watch
Nov 4 2022,positive,was really good the story was not the best but the action was amazing and fast paced
Nov 4 2022,positive,the story line made you think what makes a hero they always do good but what do we define as good getting rid of the bad guy or putting the bad guy in jail
Nov 4 2022,positive,movie is a lot of fun if you have some prior knowledge of the characters from the comics or animated movies you dont get  origin stories for all the heroes in the movie so if that bothers you be warned i personally think its unfortunate how disney can get a pass for developing their marvel characters over a series of movies while dc is expected to somehow flesh out all their superheroes in one movie they clearly purposely leave a lot of things rather ambiguous because you know it wont be the last time you see these characters def underrated film criticswise and honestly better than some of the latest disneymarvel movies that get well reviewed despite not being up to the standard of the movies that came before
Nov 4 2022,positive,it was the most awesome superhero movie ever
Nov 4 2022,positive,outstanding fidelity to the theme of the original idea masterful casting cinematography top notch
Nov 4 2022,positive,brutal i enjoyed it a lot there was nothing included which was perfect atom smasher and cyclone make a nice couple as characters hawkman very impressive in character like dwayne johnson  the young man just played his role as the high voice of the town but when he was with adam it made him want to strangle him  make good use of young people who make useful characters that is we dont want a filler character that is only for the camera like izabella from transformers 5 as well as her little robot that doesnt transform into anything and they still put it out for sale transforming into a c90     brutal la disfrute bastante  no hubo nada de inclusión la cual perfecto  atom smasher y cyclone hacen linda pareja como personajes hawkman muy imponente en personaje al igual que dwayne johnson  el joven me justo su papel como alta vos del pueblo pero cuando estaba con adam da ganas de estrangularlo usen bien ha los jóvenes que hagan personajes utiles ósea no queremos un personaje de relleno que esta solo para la camára como  izabella  de transformers 5 al igual que su robotito que no se transforma en nada y igual lo sacaron ha la venta transformándose en un  c90 
Nov 4 2022,positive,it was a lot of fun the action scenes were great
Nov 4 2022,negative,the only reason im giving this movie as much as 1 star is because i am a fan of dwayne johnson otherwise this movie just wasnt very good dc just continues its string of movies thats way too dependent on cgi and not enough dependence on a    coherent story black adam had the chance to really move dc in the right direction but other than johnson the movie was just another dc let down
Nov 4 2022,positive,i liked the movie i dislike how they ruin every story in the dc universe they just make the movie without any thought of how they could merge
Nov 4 2022,positive,rock of adam the best
Nov 4 2022,positive,finally an action movie without forced inclusion great
Nov 4 2022,positive,amazing never been a dc fan but black adam may bring me to the other side
Nov 4 2022,positive,there was an awful lot going on to try to keep track of  there were some spots that were funny but most of them were missed by others since i was the only one in the theater snickering
Nov 4 2022,positive,entertaining antihero movie even a bigger fan of dwayne johnson now  looking forward to the next one
Nov 4 2022,positive,dwayne johnson good roll enjoyed very much different storyline also good nice to see a superhero movie that is a little different they are getting so much alike   it is always to see the rock in  good movie
Nov 4 2022,positive,the movie was enjoyable and not good special effects the rock played a beleivable anti hero and reluctant hero that had to use his anger to do what a rule following hero could not much like batman when he threatened darkseid with his own bombs in the move batman superman apocalypse darkseid said only he could have convincingly carried out that threat   plus people need to remember its all fantasy
Nov 4 2022,positive,was very entertaining
Nov 4 2022,positive,some of the side stories are a bit weak  but the rock is amazing as black adam
Nov 4 2022,positive,i liked the movie love to see the rock in dc universe
Nov 4 2022,positive,one of the best dc movies 
Nov 4 2022,positive,i enjoyed the movie i prefer antiheros they are more realistic  hawkmans point was made too many times eyeroll atom smasher became annoying halfway through i would like a movie about doctor fate and cyclone
Nov 4 2022,positive,amazing movie amazing actors cgi is simply top of the tops the characters fighting script story couldnt ask for more the fact that the critics placed this movie under a 40 score is simply unacceptable someone should fire  ban those so called critics as i can simply guess they gave a 40 score just because the movie did not matched the woke criteria no lead female strong woman from sp no gay story and so on so yeah a really good movie cant wait to watch it at least 20 times more when the will eventually upload it on hbo max  thank you wb and dc for firing the woke ceo or whatever that maam was and getting back to making quality movies trust me when i say this after so many trash movies lately after this movie ended i was so happy and satisfied that i couldnt stop talking to my wife about it for like half an hour
Nov 4 2022,positive,excellent movie kept me interested and watching throughout the entire movie dewayne johnson was an excellent choice for the part of black adam would watch again
Nov 4 2022,positive,absolutely exciting the fight sequences and effects are the best of the film dr fate is unmatched a huge success for the dcu fully recommended
Nov 4 2022,positive,very entertaining highly recommend especially for children no foul language
Nov 4 2022,positive,fun visually but lacks a lot of heart and the story is a bit messy enjoyed it overall and was entertained
Nov 4 2022,positive,it was a really good movie one of the best in the dcu
Nov 4 2022,neutral,poor storyline too much slow camera use doctor fate is good caracther mainly because of pierce brosnan imponence but as most caracthers lacks   development black adam is represented as the rock and most people may like it but i dont
Nov 4 2022,positive,i usually am not a big fan of dc movies or marvel movies but i was very entertained with a lot of action and we saw it on an ultra screen and at times our seats would shake
Nov 4 2022,positive,dwyane johnson is amazing as black adamamazing action and is one of the best dc movies of all time
Nov 4 2022,positive,the story seemed a little rushed towards the end and they didnt build up the tension as much they had some good twists and turns at the end of the movie honestly if it wasnt for dwayne johnson and pierce brosnan playing their respective rolls i dont think it would have turned out as well as it did i was falling asleep mid way through the movie but the end picked up pretty well and way worth waiting for
Nov 4 2022,positive,extremely well done graphics and special effects  plus a valid story line well developed for adults and younger guests
Nov 4 2022,positive,nice a lot of action it does not disappoint
Nov 4 2022,positive,great movie has a lot of great action and doctor fate was amazing
Nov 4 2022,negative,i first went into the theatre expecting the best dc movie since zsjl instead i was met with the most meh performance ever dwane johnsons overall acting was subpar with the same facial expressions for every scene and every scenario the plot was very predictable and full of cheese superhero oneliners the movie had average pacing but there were some times when it dragged and bored me the best part of the movie for me other than the postcredit scene which to be honest was the best part of the film was the heroes introduced in particular cyclone and atom smasher if you are bored on a random weekday this is a movie that can pass the time but if you have a feeling for a fun weekend i suggest something else
Nov 4 2022,positive,not the best superhero movie ever but it was fun in parts wouldve liked to have seen hawkman and dr fate fleshed out more 
Nov 4 2022,positive,black adam is beautiful the characters is loved the villani i din t like him but is loved  the others doctor fate steals the movie the rock  acts very well my opinion is more than positive
Nov 4 2022,positive,could have been more dramatic
Nov 4 2022,positive,the visuals the cgi action were absolutely awesome and of course the post credit sceneit was just something
Nov 4 2022,positive,take it for what it is it was a wild ride with good action and a solid story just started and fills in plot as it goes along
Nov 4 2022,positive,best anti superhero movie ever lots of action and violence family must see
Nov 4 2022,positive,pleasantly surprised albeit amateurly flawed that missed the mark i will admit i had my doubts casting johnson but he nailed it so well i actually wanted more of him he needed more dialogue and less cheesy attempts at humor from everyone else the story conceptually was well played out but none of the three inexperienced superhero writers had the creativity to elevate the story past the predicable muddled cliched antics and attempts at humor  which was hit and miss i laughed out loud here and there but cringed and groaned at some of the infantile humor and dialogue the other issue was director jaume colletserras constant slowmo shots some i could understand were needed but others were just too much and felt amateurish the convoluted exposition overblown cgi and overbearing score didnt do the film any justice either this film couldve been great in the hands of better filmmakers nevertheless i enjoyed it more than expected and i feel the critics went too hard on this one its a well deserved 810 from me
Nov 4 2022,positive,black adam is a movie i would recommend people if they just want to have dumb fun the action in this movie is great the cinematography is weird but colorful pierce brosnan as dr fate was my favorite part of the movie dwayne johnson was great as usual the kid wasnt really good and should have been recasted or directed better
Nov 4 2022,positive,was good much better than i expected  these shilling critics who gave she halk 8 are intellectually deficient people 
Nov 4 2022,positive,the hierarchy of power in the dc universe has changed
Nov 4 2022,positive,i loved it i did not expect what they presented me i thought it was going to be bad but i was surprised i added it to my catalog of my favorite movies
Nov 4 2022,negative,just a typical dwayne johnson movie pierce brosnan was the best part action was subpar better to watch on hbo
Nov 4 2022,positive,definitely one of the best dc movies packed with action  amazing visuals should be a good watch for anybody not just comic buffs
Nov 4 2022,negative,worst movie i have seen in years jaws 3 was better
Nov 4 2022,positive,exactly what the dc universe needed great story telling and building up the character instead of just throwing a character in as they have in the past finally expanding more into the extended universe of characters that exist besides the batmansuperman and closely intertwined characters around them the rock did great in this role
Nov 4 2022,positive,this is the best movie different story superhero genre comedy action suspense thriller and everything is balance i enjoy plz everyone watch this movie now dc black adam 
Nov 4 2022,positive,grab your popcorn soda some candy and enjoy the ride  its a great escape enjoy
Nov 4 2022,positive,was a really good superhero movie i personally loved it
Nov 4 2022,positive,its not a bad movie id recommend it
Nov 4 2022,negative,weak storyline with very small and lame attempts to be touching and tender  virtually no acting as every screen is a cgi fight  the rock was suspended in the air for the entire film may have actually had his feet on the ground for 90 seconds total  no introduction of main characters they just get into the fight  the super hero genre has passed its prime and is now flailing a dead horse this film is proof
Nov 4 2022,positive,whats not to like  entertained  check  funny check   amazing videography  check   fantastic cast check   i give it 5 stars because it did what it had to do i had fun watching it
Nov 4 2022,positive,great cast but not enough story and to many fighting seems
Nov 4 2022,positive,this was a fun ride with black adam  saw it twice already and going for a third taking my daughter this weekend  love the character and love supermans return  leggo dceu
Nov 4 2022,positive,a good watch great special effects the sequel is anticipated
Nov 4 2022,positive,could have been more darker but good movie
Nov 4 2022,neutral,i must say this is just like the movie morbius its not so good i dindt enjoy the movie
Nov 4 2022,positive,best of dc   i almost shed a tear twice the humor is great not like the buffoons from marvel the hero is cool i want to look up to such a person and respect him
Nov 4 2022,negative,well as the list of films at the theaters arent any better you might as well smell what the rock is cooking i think he had 3 lines in the movie and rest is bad cgi smash and smash scenes the rock should have stuck with fast and furious 19 go see this movie if you have nothing else to do some of the scenes are well done other than that poor acting in the supporting cast the rock had very few lines so its just him flying around and shooting lightening bolts and even that looked awkward flying standing up wait till i tell superman   c minus see me after class
Nov 4 2022,positive,if anyone ask me how black adam looks like i can say without any doubts that is dj of hollywood dwayne johansson 
Nov 4 2022,positive,i thought it was a solid movie i genuinely do not know what the critics are watching they have always had a high brow elitist attitude when it comes to superhero franchises anyways     a great introduction to the character and an all round good time
Nov 4 2022,positive,i absolutely loved it this movie was simply phenomenal i loved the portrayal of every character the story was exciting and the effects looked great
Nov 4 2022,negative,cut scenes didnt come together which made the movie boring and dull   in some of the scenes black adam was floating  why couldnt he just stand still and talk like a normal person   all in all black adams cutscenes were rushed along with the dialog this made the movie boring and dull
Nov 4 2022,positive,definitely a movie worth watching
Nov 4 2022,negative,spoiler alert black adam seemed to combine past popular film scenes while the writing felt pointless the action seems were fun to watch but the dialogue was forced the jokes all missed the mark and the plot seemed rushed when referring to the past popular film scenes i mean the beginning scenes that felt like 300 especially with the kick off the ledge also the scene with the jla forming for the first time and flying off the jet was 100 taken from xmen the introduction to the characters was so rushed yet the writing made it feel like we should know who cyclone and adam smasher are already overall another dc let down
Nov 4 2022,neutral,battle scenes were pretty awesome but the acting and story lacked so much still a fun watch tho 
Nov 4 2022,positive,the pacing of the movie wasnt the greatest but i loved the characters and the introduction of more magic i think its a great set up for future wizards in the dc universe the rock did a good job of not going over the top this time around there were cheesy moments but i thought it was in good taste     i kind of wish they told us a little more about dr fate  hawkman but the movie is called black adam so i cant be too mad
Nov 4 2022,positive,it was good cant wait for the second one to come out
Nov 4 2022,positive,those fight scenes with black adam and hawkman were amazing i fucking enjoyed the shit out of them i live for those scenes black adams character is so well done and his character development is so meaningful i love him i wish they didnt forced that quote with the crown of sabbac so many times making it obvious like all the characters say in the movie to find the meaning of the crowns words it was annoyingly unfunny the uncle of the boy was super hilarious his humor is top tear i love black adams moments with drfate also when they both talk about their sarcasm moments its so funny i never laughed that hard at a movie before you can tell dwayne johnson put heart in this movie
Nov 4 2022,positive,really awesome anti hero movie ignore the critics and go see this movie it had really good timing and pacing and awesome comic relief i did think cyclone was twirling too much it reminded me of winx club fairies
Nov 4 2022,positive,it was good the story was interesting and consistent the little boy was a bit awkward and cheesy but the rock did an amazing job
Nov 4 2022,positive,lots of action popcorn movie all the way
Nov 4 2022,positive,good movie  i really like the rock  really good on black adam  i just dont like the mom  she could better instead of boring and just 1 facial expression only  however  i still give 5 stars because i really the rock  the best movie star
Nov 4 2022,positive,liked special effects characters action
Nov 4 2022,positive,it really makes my day a wonderful movie highly recommend this
Nov 4 2022,positive,full of action plot was very good and insane soundtracks and also everyones performance was just absoluzely insane would recommend 1010 movie
Nov 4 2022,positive,it was highly entertaining love the rock the casting was fairly good minus a few actors who need just a little bit more training the movie started off a bit slow but picked up later on when dwayne appeared on the screen if theyre going to make this a huge success the supporting actors must also be hurt as equally strong with star power it was pretty good overall will there be another time its dc they never stop at one
Nov 4 2022,positive,really good action movie
Nov 4 2022,positive,pretty good i dont know if you would like it if you arent a dc fan though theres many characters from previous movies
Nov 4 2022,positive,good movie with fun action loved it and saw it 3x so far
Nov 4 2022,positive,looked cool  otherwise very generic  would have preferred they stuck to keeping black adam a villain that is sometimes and antihero instead of making him the antihero that is sometimes a hero  i guess thats what happens when you change a characters motivations from i want power and i killed my best friend to get it into they killed my son  generic
Nov 4 2022,positive,great movie  black adam lives up to and surpasses the hype my new indicator is the audience score as the tomatometer is completely unreliable given the shill critics and their paid for reviews  this movie proves the critics are as worthless as their reviews
Nov 4 2022,neutral,the embodiment of the average superhero flick i am glad that the rock finally got his own superhero film with that said this film is just average in every aspect its mostly forgettable and made the same errors that marvel makes in their films the film felt stale and rushed it didnt seem like the directors and writers put a lot of heart into it
Nov 4 2022,positive,the film is surprising as it demonstrates that it has mastered how to tell a story in the superhero genre keeping a good pace and focusing on the essentials something that reminds me of more films before the mcu about this genre with constant decisive main character choices throughout the plot but also points out how to evolve and develop the mc without expositive dialogues about itself giving more space for other narrative nuclei to unfold bettero filme surpreende uma vez que demonstra ter masterizado como contar uma história do gênero de superheróis mantendo um bom ritmo e se focando no essencial algo que me lembra mais filmes antes do mcu sobre esse gênero com constantes escolhas decisivas do main character no decorrer da trama mas também aponta o como evoluir e desenvolvor o mc sem diálogos expositivos sobre si mesmo dando mais espaço para outros núcleos narrativos se desenrolarem melhor
Nov 4 2022,positive,i really enjoyed this film the rock did a great job and the supporting characters were fun way better than thor love and thunder
Nov 4 2022,positive,like the characters and the rock
Nov 4 2022,positive,awesome loved every minute
Nov 4 2022,positive,what the hell critics this was way better than a 40  we finally get a character that is not a cliche and not a goody2shoes but has lots of redeeming qualities i loved the movie both times i saw it and cant wait for the sequel especially after the credits scene
Nov 4 2022,positive,one of the finest movie ever watched
Nov 4 2022,positive,i loved the movie especially when superman appeared
Nov 4 2022,positive,if you like action superheroes and a story that isnt cookie cutter check it out
Nov 4 2022,negative,i cant believe dwayne johnson would waste his talent on junk like this
Nov 4 2022,negative,its a very blasphemous movie  which i regret having seen  i have no words to describe how diabolical it is
Nov 4 2022,positive,liked the action but predictable plot
Nov 4 2022,positive,pretty solid movie it will be cool to see him mixing it up with the likes of superman and shazam in the future
Nov 4 2022,negative,its pg13 so i already had low expectations still terrible especially the scriptwriting mostly just old tropes bad jokes and cartoonish cgi
Nov 4 2022,positive,great movie cant wait for black adam vs superman
Nov 4 2022,positive,black adam was good i guess i watched it on the theaters yesterday and i liked it but it wasnt a good story the movie was funny and all but it was very ordinary and didnt introduce nothing new to the audience
Nov 4 2022,positive,this movie is amazing to watch with your friends the rock is amazing as black adam and we need a sequel right now
Nov 4 2022,positive,i cant see anything wrong with this movie at all to be honest
Nov 4 2022,negative,i honestly dont know how this movie is rated so high it was just a bunch of cgi graphics and action and lacked a real plot i could care less about the characters in the film it was horrible
Nov 4 2022,positive,really loved how they played with introducing more characters into the dcu plan on going to see it again
Nov 4 2022,positive,good movie by dc interesting story with lots of action
Nov 3 2022,positive,great action packed super hero movie
Nov 3 2022,positive,good action sequences felt dwayne johnson did a really good job comedy wasnt shoved down your throat but was subtle
Nov 3 2022,positive,best superhero movie yet
Nov 3 2022,positive,better than expected great visuals and effects and dwayne johnson as the reluctant but powerful hero was entertaining
Nov 3 2022,positive,this movie was really fun and action packed and the rock did an amazing job and the rest of the cast were great too dc needs to keep making superhero movies like this
Nov 3 2022,negative,very mixed bag i am sure there will be another one hope its better
Nov 3 2022,positive,i loved everything about black adam great story and action me and my brother really enjoyed it
Nov 3 2022,positive,awesome is what i had expected and more a 
Nov 3 2022,positive,awesome movie definitely recomend
Nov 3 2022,positive,cgi was bad but otherwise good movie
Nov 3 2022,negative,poor casting for the justice society roles so stereotypical and mindless story couldve been tightened up too much of the same scene repeated
Nov 3 2022,positive,very nice special effects
Nov 3 2022,negative,succeeds in making shazam look oscarworthy and the marvel movies compelling
Nov 3 2022,positive,best dc movie so far
Nov 3 2022,positive,amazing movie i loved it everything about the movie was perfect acting fighting everything
Nov 3 2022,positive,i loved it just saw it last night took my 3 brothers to watch it and we couldnt stop talking about how bad ass he is and then we debated who would win in a fight between black adam and superman and black adam vs shazam it was amazing i came out that movie wanting to have electric or thunder powers
Nov 3 2022,positive,its enjoyable i had a lot of fun with it
Nov 3 2022,negative,all action zero story
Nov 3 2022,positive,why does dc always have to introduce the main villain like 23 into the movie it makes it feel like the first 23rd of their movies are pointless
Nov 3 2022,neutral,i was a little disappointed after watching this one i was really hoping for so much more especially in the character developement and plot  dc usually dives deeper into character especially when compared to marvel often too much making the movies long drawn out and arguably boring  however i think they took that criticism too far and pumped out a movie full of action and nothing else     picture sounds and action scenes are all top notch and is a fun watch if thats you care for  i often feel like dc rips off character traits from marvel characters and gives the super a new name and slightly different look but honestly i felt like i was watching a weird misfit avengers i was never into the comic books and dont know much on the characters other than what i see in the movies so it could be marvel rips off dc and puts it out to movie quicker but again dc always seems to be a beat behind marvel     i really hope they make a sequel to this and bring in the varsity team to go up against black adam because the jv team seemed cheesy and underwhelming
Nov 3 2022,positive,simple fun and unpretentious with awesome moments
Nov 3 2022,negative,i like the rock  hes great its all charm and personality wrapped in massively strong body and handsome face  hes a draw card  if hes in a film i want to see it  and im not the only one  superhero movies are dying  theyre becoming the same and producers are not willing to take a step into creative ideas for fear of upsetting the intolerable fanboy trolls so its to the photocopier and reprint the same ole ideas and tropes  not even the great rock can save the genre
Nov 3 2022,positive,outstanding a must see
Nov 3 2022,negative,bland unnecessary slow motion fight scenes glad superman is back and thats about it wont dc ever make a hero thats not unbeatable its so stupid that its kind blowing
Nov 3 2022,positive,the story line consist of drama suspense and lots of action the special effects keeps viewers on the edge of their seat
Nov 3 2022,positive,the rock is the saving grace of this movie i guess you can make any movie with the rock and it would still be entertaining other than that this is another dc disaster lackluster story too much cgi hawkman that isnt really hawkman ifyouknowwhatimsayin decent popcorn the rock vehicle
Nov 3 2022,positive,the best heroes movie so far
Nov 3 2022,positive,the critics on rotten tomatoes can go suck a dick    i am 100 sure that the critics on rotten tomatoes have been paid by marvel to bash dc    dwayne johnson promises and delivers   after the pile of shitshows that marvel has been forcing down our throats in phase 4 and calling it superhero fatigue for their poor response dcs black adam proves that the genre has much more to offer and marvel cannot keep blaming the masses for not responding to their crap  i can safely say that black adam has raised the bar for dc and i am eagerly waiting for shazam 2  black panther is marvels one chance at redemption lets hope they dont screw up again
Nov 3 2022,positive,i enjoy all the action and storyline
Nov 3 2022,positive,we loved it as lots of action throughout the whole movie loved the actors as kept our interest 
Nov 3 2022,negative,wowwowwow thats was awful
Nov 3 2022,positive,the movie was actually average when compared to the classics but due to the terrible stuff coming from hollywood it gives the impression of being better than what it was  pierce brosnan was good the rock could have done better especially the transition from weak and timid person to a rageful  vengeful character
Nov 3 2022,negative,lazy loud nonsensical and the biggest sin of all for a movie of this type boring  i didnt expect much but honestly left feeling like my intelligence and patience had been insulted  if i could give it a lower score than this i would
Nov 3 2022,positive,just a great action superhero movie in general best enjoyed at a theater
Nov 3 2022,positive,it was a good ans watchable movie with funny jokes and great characters and people who hate it ok but i would recommend it
Nov 3 2022,negative,theres stuff to like here but im with the critics  this movie is a mess disappointing to see dc copy marvels method and to see the masses here in agreement big loud nutty action doesnt make a good superhero movie imo character study does
Nov 3 2022,negative,black adam represents an extreme low point in the canon of dc films this is a movie that has no respect for its genre or for its audience it has no sense of the basic storytelling structure that goes into making an engaging involving memorable film the superhero genre has no future if this is the kind of empty mindless meaningless slugfest that becomes its standard bearer black adam ends with a brief epilogue that reminds us of earlier much better films in the genre that still had heart and meaning the glimmer of hope this memory provides feels hollow though after suffering through two hours of a hopeless artless mindless gesture
Nov 3 2022,positive,black adams back story was really dynamic well produced and well acted the characters balanced seriousness and humor well i was left with questions about when present day was given some of the technology used by the intergang i think it was definitely worth watching
Nov 3 2022,negative,i was so excited for this movie i even bought a project rock black adam under armour training top but sadly i was left quite disappointed i wont say too much just that the movie would be more appealing to 10 year olds it was very predictable and extremely corny and thought that superman being there at the end was just stupid as superman would have gotten involved already and not just because she asked him as a favour big thumbs down from me 
Nov 3 2022,positive,dwayne and pierce bronson carried the movie      the movie was a mess with cheap laughs trying to style like the opposition to the bad one liners or unnecessary music snippets during the movie oh and dont forget the cgi  i guess they dont make them like they used to    it was like watching a snyder dc and marvel trying to make a baby it just didnt work    the slow boringgggg intro made me want to sleep it seemed cheap it seemed rushed     dwayne is a amazing black adam and his role is bad ass i would watch again just for him  however the movie lacked snyder and black adam is what i would have loved to see    would i watch in a cinema  probably not  home movie yeah for sure definitely i dont like where any superhero movie is heading these days it all seems like its quality over quantity      restorethesnyderverse  marveldiedwithendgame
Nov 3 2022,positive,its messy and uneven especially from the beginning but its still a fun ride i appreciate its twists and its mid credit scene 
Nov 3 2022,positive,saw it first week out  fun solid movie
Nov 3 2022,positive,the movie was great one of dc best movies that they have made in a very long time action for beginning to end good suspense shocking plot twist
Nov 3 2022,positive,dumb fun worth the theater experience not worth the story worth seeing censored come back
Nov 3 2022,positive,zugeer l tasarhai kino marvel hog dc best of the best black adam real hero
Nov 3 2022,positive,besides the living hollywood legends as far as blockbusters go dwayne johnson is one of the only names out there that will draw a crowd these days its all about the spectacle or whether or not a good story is enough to pull people in the way of the hollywood star is going away but johnson is one of the few keeping that notion alive im saying this because i dont think this film would be getting as much attention without him in the leading role and i also dont think i wouldve enjoyed it as much without this particular cast heres why although its a mess you may get some enjoyment out of black adam as i did    imprisoned for over 5000 years a man named teth adam is unleashed on the world the justice society a team of superpowered individuals is on the hunt for him when they find this out but more significant threats will take precedence having the powers of the egyptian gods teth adam begins to tear apart and kill anyone who stands against him this was his moral code back in the day and still remains the fishoutofwater scenarios are what made this film enjoyable though     dwayne johnson plays a more stoic version of his beloved persona and i thought it worked well here on top of that i thought the additions of aldis hodge hawkman pierce brosnan dr fate noah centineo atom smasher and quintessa swindell cyclone as the justice society were all great and played off each other well it was the fact that i loved all the characters that left me overall enjoying this film the biggest issue is that it moves very quickly and tells two films worth of story in about two hours there was no room for anything to breathe     in the end im not complaining about the pace of the film because thats the furthest thing from the problem it moves at a very solid pace but the justice society comes basically out of nowhere and because i liked all the characters so much throughout this film i really wish we had a film or series that fleshed them out more great characters with zero backstories are just frustrating its filled with great superhero action and dwayne johnson is very good in the role and jaume colletserra did a great job directing an exciting film but i do feel that the writers just stuffed too much into a film that felt smallscale in terms of scope and locations by no means a great movie but if youre looking for some fun action that you can enjoy some popcorn with this is it
Nov 3 2022,positive,i changed this from a 25 to a 3 for the rock in the movie his physicality presence and charisma shine through despite his characters reserved nature the rest of the cast of heroes were pretty average the main problem i feel with dc is the lack of a coherent vision the mcu anchored and humanised the core avengers with the ironman and captain america films before bringing them together dc just slam em all in there in one movie and expects it to work who is hawkman what are his powers why can he go toe to toe with black adam if the dc films were in a world without the mcu i think i would like them more but they are outclassed in every area story pacing character development action humour emotion
Nov 3 2022,positive,absolute freash dc comic movies
Nov 3 2022,positive,great movie for an action flick not too much comedy exactly what the doctor ordered
Nov 3 2022,positive,i loved the movie the action and visual effects where on point the comedy was timed perfectly and felt natural the story was average but the movie was absolutely enjoyable
Nov 3 2022,negative,one of the worst movies i have seen in a decade  cheesy  terrible story line  cgi overkill  bad acting and  i want a refund so disappointing
Nov 3 2022,positive,the movie has its flaws the story would be the best example but the action the music and the side characters make this movie worth the watch
Nov 3 2022,positive,it was okay kept me entertained felt like the movie barrowed stories and themes from other super hero movies the writing could have been better and the character for the young boy in the film is annoying overall it was okay but it wasnt worth a movie theatre viewing
Nov 3 2022,positive,better than thor love and thunder
Nov 3 2022,positive,awesome the rock is great the cast is great also the action  and the post credit scene isspeechless
Nov 3 2022,positive,a must watch epic film rock my man this will be a milestone for the snyder fans since this movie can be the bridge between snyderverse and dceu
Nov 3 2022,positive,i loved it i was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie  i wasnt bored for a minute
Nov 3 2022,positive,awesome movie worth the watch
Nov 3 2022,positive,it was cool not bad at all
Nov 3 2022,positive,very good and movie moved along black adam was a very believable super hero     i liked the ending this was really a feel good movie
Nov 3 2022,positive,finally a real superheroe movie like old times like the good comics a mean from the 60s to first decade of 2000s  marvel is bringing too much garbage to the genre the last thor is a shame and now what they do to namor is a crime we need more of this movies dc is your time
Nov 3 2022,positive,absolutely great superhero movie great visuals many cool moments really enjoyed it just wish lore was fleshed out a bit more
Nov 3 2022,positive,it was entertaining just dont think to hard about the story
Nov 3 2022,positive,black adam is your typical superheroantihero movie with a cliche plot im sure many scenes were awesome for your diehard comic book fans but corny for your typical movie goer this movie throws a lot at you like it doesnt even bother to explain the justice society just know that theyre there and theyre main characters dwayne johnson does a terrific job playing black adam and aldis hodge does a great job playing hawkman too last take the action scenes in this movie were awesome
Nov 3 2022,positive,i gotta tell you black adam is gotta to be the most best dc film of the year i dont care the critics dont like the movie but i love it black adam as one of my top favorite dc movie to this day
Nov 3 2022,positive,loved the actionthe rock was born to play  black adamjustice society could have been betteroverall 1 of the better dc moviesstay after the credits
Nov 3 2022,positive,given im a fan of the superhero genre and the rock i was hoping for a very enjoyable movie outing it certainly delivers this with the action and some of the main characters have you wanting a lot more but once again the character development is paper thin and plotline is average which is disappointing as this could of been so much more   the movie is a good popcorn munching separation from reality for a few hours but another dc let down unfortunately worth the watch for a bit of fun but not something youd watch over and over
Nov 3 2022,positive,excellent this movie really does everything great action story cgi and gives emotions right where they should be even from the begining is great
Nov 3 2022,positive,absolutely amazing cant wait for next chapter to unfold
Nov 3 2022,positive,really good and exiting
Nov 3 2022,positive,a great entry into the dc universe job well done
Nov 3 2022,positive,it was action packed but i didnt like the demonic character towards the end yes black defeated him but wasnt a fan of the character
Nov 3 2022,positive,came in with low expectations but ended up liking it a lot more than i thought it was a bit of a mess at times but when black adam is doing his thing i was entertained
Nov 3 2022,positive,what is largely an intro to both shazams great nemesis and the justice society of america is a cliched violencedriven allegory for colonial oppression that would have felt much more powerful if any of the characters had proper development
Nov 3 2022,positive,it was full of excitement and the characters presented were a must from dc it didnt have a great story but it manage with its action
Nov 3 2022,negative,too many marvel copycats they even had an antmandeadpool embarrassing to watch
Nov 3 2022,positive,pretty good the ending is lit must see
Nov 3 2022,positive,cant wait to see more integration of black adam into the dc universe
Nov 3 2022,positive,decent movie great action scenes though
Nov 3 2022,positive,finally is all i can say after watching this movie i like to think that most people are sick of the crap movies hollywood keeps trying to shove down consumers throats however this movie was what movie goers want men actually being men and not the pssies hollywood has portrayed men as for the past couple of years and thank the lord above not a masculine toxic woman as the lead character role the woman in the movie was strong and feminine without being a bitter hag that hates on men the whole time and pretends she can do it all this movie is a better representative real women strong woman who look up to their strong man and look after their child first and foremost not what hollywood tries to make us into please please continue to make movies like this the fans are so hungry for better thank you dwayne johnson et al for not forgetting about the fans    sincerely  an appreciate consumer
Nov 3 2022,positive,the characters were well developed and colorful  acting was a bit overdone and plot predictable  special effects  were well done   the rock  was great
Nov 3 2022,positive,i like that he didnt see himself as a hero and punished the bad guys for being bad tired of the bad guys always getting away with murder literally a true guardian
Nov 3 2022,negative,the writing was awful the characters cellophane deep so many missed opportunities with needlessly superficial scenes they could have spent in developing characters and a reason to care about them which never occurs in this film had everyone been killed your reaction would have been meh the cgi keeps improving in these comic book films but the scripts just keep getting worse
Nov 3 2022,positive,in my opinion it is not a great movie but it is good it fulfills what it promises it takes the action to the bottom and if you are one of those who likes that genre then it is for you just enjoy the movie without seeing its mistakes that some movies have more superhero ones not all of them are perfect the plot is not good nor the script either but i think that most fans and film critics are demanding in some aspects and when we want to see something the movie does not show it and our opinion becomes very negative and we see only the bad and not the good of it we just have to give it an opportunity and put aside the opinion of others and analyze our own imagine that later they show the origin of the characters we saw and did not know their history my rating for this is a 7510
Nov 3 2022,positive,nonstop epic action throughout the entire film that it makes it perfect
Nov 2 2022,positive,great action packed movie a must see

Nov 2 2022,positive,it was action packed and extremely entertaining cant wait for black adam to fight superman
Nov 2 2022,positive,the movie was alright and entertaining it wasnt the worst dc movie and i would rank it in the above average for dc movies
Nov 2 2022,positive,its a good movie however it suffers from a lot of action and little plot its entertaining but i think its more of the same as what dc has its good to go see with the family or to eat popcorn
Nov 2 2022,positive,it was so cool to see it at the cinemareally liked it
Nov 2 2022,positive,i like that there is a lot of action but the story feels a little bit all over the place overall its a good action movie
Nov 2 2022,negative,embarrassingly awful from start to finish    1 a script balanced solely around plot armour voice overs and slow motion    2 scenes in the trailer which werent in the uk theatrical release perhaps this isnt a new thing but up to now i can only think of soundtracks being guilty of this pointing at you starship troopers speaking of soundtracks    3 the only time ive ever regretted hearing paint it black by the rolling stones    4 possibly the worst portrayal of a child character amon i have ever seen on the big screen
Nov 2 2022,positive,from the beginning to end fabulous
Nov 2 2022,positive,the only time critics are right on this site is when audience score and critics score are close from each others
Nov 2 2022,positive,its the best dc movie
Nov 2 2022,positive,the action the humor the costumes and special effects
Nov 2 2022,positive,excitingaction packedsuspensefuland definitely worth a trip to the movies with the entire family
Nov 2 2022,negative,dont waste your timenothing newterrible script
Nov 2 2022,positive,very good movie to enjoy action everywhere superman in the end was the icing on the cake
Nov 2 2022,positive,one of the best dceu movies with a lot of action and good special effects
Nov 2 2022,positive,the movie its good actually pretty good for a superhero movie  feels new and refreshing
Nov 2 2022,positive,great film laughed a lot got really into the action loved the cinematography really enjoyed this take on the black adam character loved doctor fate and really liked hawkman
Nov 2 2022,positive,loved it action packed
Nov 2 2022,positive,yet another one where the audience love it but the critics trash it whats not to like
Nov 2 2022,positive,honestly better than morbius definently one of the movies of all time also i love the collab in fortnite
Nov 2 2022,positive,great fun gotta ride with the fairy tale but a ride worth taking much more enjoyable then other recent superhero flicks
Nov 2 2022,positive,i thought it was pretty good i was entertained the whole time finally a darker super hero thats not scared to go the extra mile
Nov 2 2022,positive,is a good start for the dc movies  keep them coming
Nov 2 2022,positive,now thats how a action packed super hero movie should be
Nov 2 2022,positive,packed with action it had some comedy very good movie and my children loved it
Nov 2 2022,negative,15 stars due to the fact that the effects were good simply put the movie had a very base storyline which hardly evolved through the proceedings ive never seen a film with such a huge percentage of actionfight sequences  its what the movie over heavily relied onbut they were in the main largely cliched a rotten out of place musical score just added to this snorefest also  has any film ever had so many slomo sequesnces  far too many i never thought that a pure action film would have me bored  bit it did 
Nov 2 2022,positive,very good movie tons of action and humor totally worth the watch
Nov 2 2022,positive,if you love actionpacked superhero movies then black adam is the film for you it has all of that and much more    the storyline of black adam starts with teth adam who has been given a gift from the gods right before his execution becoming black adam dwayne johnson he uses these powers to overthrow the evil leader of ancient kahndaq and becomes known as the champion wheit is believed that one day the champion will come back to save kahndaq in the present adrianna sarah shahi and her brother karim mohammed amer uncover black adams tomb where he has been imprisoned for 5000 years kahndaq is in need of a warrior but a group of heroes called the justice society believes that black adam is not who he seems to be    the films strongest point is definitely the setting kahndaq is brought to life in this film so vividly the buildings the people the scenery  everything fits together perfectly i love black adams backstory and how well thought out everything about his character is the movie has so much action and excitement its hard to not watch the acting is great too i especially love the character of karim  hes such a nice guy and some of my favorite scenes include his character my favorite scene is when hes singing in the car by himself as his sister goes in to explore a cave and he stayed behind then his sister comes running out screaming because they are in danger and he has no idea whats going on    the message of black adam is that family is everything between adriana and her brother or adriana and her son and even in black adams own past we see this message play out this movie has a lot of violence and a bit of bad language that parents should watch out for    i give black adam 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18 plus adults  by kendall b kids first
Nov 2 2022,positive,the visuals were wonderful and while i appreciated the message black adam was attempting to put forward i didnt feel as if it was executed as well as it could have been i am glad however that this movie introducesreintroduces so many new elements to the dcu and i am looking forward to seeing where each of these characters go i am especially excited to see whats next for the justice society and dr fate
Nov 2 2022,positive,is a good start for the dc universal  keep them coming
Nov 2 2022,positive,the movie was really good i was hoping it would have been good enough to satisfy my expectations and it did black adam will be a good addition to the dceu movies
Nov 2 2022,positive,i am beginning to believe that expert criticism has been corrupted by having only 40  the movie is fun coherent and has appropriate fan service  for me it is one of the best dc movies i have ever seen
Nov 2 2022,positive,top 5 best super hero movie
Nov 2 2022,positive,definitely one of the best and coolest movies we dc fans could deserve
Nov 2 2022,neutral,exhaustingly mediocre there was no reason to care about any of the characters at all and the story was thin the action and the score were fun and visuals werefinebut everything in it just kind of happened without the necessary impact the sheer level of cliches contained in it is also annoying constant slomo everyones a hero the boring villain stupid jokes etc   it has a decent vibe but overall just kind of mid
Nov 2 2022,positive,i went in with low expectations because of johnson always playing the same role since he didnt have much dialogue it made him more passable the effects were great and action was fun the plot was easy to digest and some sequences had been done before but hawkman and doctor fate bumped up the intensity overall it was fun and uncomplicated
Nov 2 2022,positive,fun and entertaining movie dc is starting to finally become something worthwhile between this james gunns suicide squad and peacemaker a little darkness mixed with light hearted adult humor dwayne the rock johnson was as electrifying as ever and his deliveries along the rest of the cast made for a fun night at the movies writing could have been better but that didnt slow down what my family and i found to be super fun to watch keep it up dc
Nov 2 2022,positive,black adam is a superhero movie or antihero i should say that struggles from some poorly acted characters and a bland story it is only saved by its few fun action scenes and the likable nature of its lead dwayne the rock johnson with pretty decent pacing we find ourselves in an eternal struggle with rocks black adam of accepting his hero nature unfortunately it doesnt get the ending that it deserves from being a fun ride for the first two acts
Nov 2 2022,positive,lots of action love the characters
Nov 2 2022,positive,best anti hero movies jsa need more movie credit scene is awesome
Nov 2 2022,positive,good movie cant wait for the sequel my wife who doesnt care for comic movies thought it was good
Nov 2 2022,positive,it was a great action packed movie that can stand alone in the dceu it was serious when needed and had enough jokes to be fun the justice society was a great add but i wish they had given more of a backstory before throwing them into battle
Nov 2 2022,positive,really good movie long but didnt feel like it wasnt boring good storyline and acting fun and emotional to watch worth the money also stan the rock
Nov 2 2022,positive,predictable but overall good cgi scenes could have been a little tighter if you like dc its a good watch
Nov 2 2022,positive,i really enjoyed it  i never read about black adam in any comics and only saw a few animated pieces on him so i didnt know what to expect  i was pleasantly surprised by the film  they took the time to develop black adam including his full backstory  the other superheroes didnt have as much development although they put in strong performances pierce brosnan was perfectly suited for his role as doctor fate and really brought out the pathos of black adam  you really felt for him and his role in the latter part of the film really made it enjoyable you get a full sense of who black adam is and what his motivations are      the cgi gets a tad excessive at times and i felt some of it was completely unnecessary  if you focus on adam and his adoptive family you can have a good time at the movies  stay for another scene after the movie wraps  i cant remember if its pre or midcredits but its worth it  there is no postcredits scene
Nov 2 2022,neutral,its a good visual spectacule but not much else the first half of the movie is aceptable but the rest is cringley bad predictible and the inclusion of the kid and his family in the battle was so forced this is supose to be an antihero but except for the pg13 killing there isnt a reason to call him that
Nov 2 2022,positive,enjoyed the movie action scenes are phenomenal also the music
Nov 2 2022,positive,action packed love the antihero vibes and despite being cgi heavy it is still a lot of fun postcredits also had me gushing
Nov 2 2022,positive,way better than everything marvel has made lately
Nov 2 2022,positive,i love dc as much as the next guy but compared to other dc properties such as man of steel dark knight trilogy etc this can not be a 90 im sorry but just as much as i hate the critics and rt being assholes generally towards dci can not stand either a fake uprising by the dc fans just because this is dc property its a 7 at best   the visuals are really good the effects are greatbut the story is kind of messy overall its good i do recommend itbut not 90 good sorry
Nov 2 2022,positive,coming in i didnt know much about black adam i thought it had enough story line for an origin movie and enough action so you werent completely bored with the story lots of fun and loved the tiein to other dc movies
Nov 2 2022,negative,effects were generally good but i think its a very poor script battles between the indestructible entities gets boring quick several cg generated shots of humans were very obviously fake i literally thought the movie was over two times based on huge battle sequences but then theres another and then another it was just a bit of a mess with unlikable characters
Nov 2 2022,positive,this movie is awesome with the story plot characters zero forced inclusion and more a movie ill watch ober and over again without grtting boredcritics consensus are dumb and less and less people trust their critics and reviews
Nov 2 2022,positive,it had everything in it that a lot of dc movies just dont have
Nov 2 2022,positive,it is interesting to see the rock making a more serious role out of its ordinary and it is very successful many actions and characters are perfect it changes of marvel that we see the same characters for several years always the same things black adam can be the first in a long series of very good dc films the comedy is very well balanced it is not stupid and it is very well positioned throughout the movie darker more violent and more adult dc takes a good direction with this film
Nov 2 2022,positive,excellent special effects  very entertaining
Nov 2 2022,negative,starts with a 10 minute voiceover explaining the film setup instead of actually showing the story in film terrible dialog delivered by people just reading lines no real acting cringey jokes stupid premises 2 normal people and a kid fighting an army of the dead which are supposed to be a threat to the whole world with a pipe wtf dont know any characters real background as the film doesnt elaborate on any back stories throughout any attempt at back stories is told out right in singular pieces of dialog spoken by characters no depth to it pacing of the movie is horrendous it never stops even when trying to be serious in moments it has action music playing things happen in this movie just to have things happen not well thoughtout plot points the only reason people like this film is because of some of the cgi action sequences in which black adam kills and destroys stuff that and the potential for his character to fight superman in the future just more superhero trash let these films die so we can have something more from hollywood
Nov 2 2022,negative,very predictable and boring movie even the rock cant save it
Nov 2 2022,positive,loved it rock is a beast
Nov 2 2022,positive,best superhero movie of 2022 
Nov 2 2022,positive,good movie good action 710
Nov 2 2022,positive,great movie excited for the dc take over hopefully haha
Nov 2 2022,positive,great movie loved every second of it action packed and tear jerking all at the same time 1010 would watch again
Nov 2 2022,negative,too long and boring in parts
Nov 2 2022,positive,i just cant get why the criticism even from people who liked the movie come from  the only issue i noticed is that the music in the first half of the movie is great but on the second one it seems to vanished maybe its volume was so low i didnt even notice it anymore  but the story it made me feel like i was into a 80s or 90s comic book even things like not giving details on society of justice members even if you never saw anything about them is pretty much like a comics book playsyou dont need to understand who are they and amanda waller but you get very easily what they do and what are their roles the boss the guys who travel world to fight super problems  oh yeah and fire the guy who did the trailer and put a spoiler there that was meant to be a surprise for people not paying attention   overall one of the best super heroes movie in last couple years and is the dc one that more closely remembers a marvel phase1 movie  10 of 10 for me just had a blast of fun and was involved in story and characters what else do you need
Nov 2 2022,positive,not enough focus on black adam and too much on the other group superman wasnt in it long enough
Nov 2 2022,positive,movie was epic dc has a great thing going here hopefully they stick with it
Nov 2 2022,positive,just a plain and simple fun superhero movie and i mean that in a good way  my kids loved it
Nov 2 2022,positive,good plot a solid background story great characters awesome action and of course the rock definitely did not disappoint
Nov 2 2022,positive,this is a great movie all the hard work that dwayne johnson put in to make this movie happen has finally paid off the movie strikes a good balance between action and setting up things for the future of dceu the casts performances are also on point with the rock and pierce brosnan stealing the scenes they are in
Nov 2 2022,positive,i thought the movie was great a better dc movie than others i have not liked so much reminded me of a marvel movie which is a good thing in my book i thought dwayne johnson did well in that role wish they had better character development for members of the justice league that showed up but a good movie overall
Nov 2 2022,positive,it was a really fun movie with a decent story but a lot of awesome action and some funny parts with a good pace that keeps the movie flowing all the way to the end
Nov 2 2022,positive,i got fun with this movie
Nov 2 2022,positive,so much fun the action scenes made me see its worth the money to watch this movie made me hate the hero side i really hate amanda waller 
Nov 2 2022,positive,lots of action  some humor dewayne johnson was great  so were all the other actors
Nov 2 2022,positive,it was one of the best dc movies i have seen in a while great action throughout the movie
Nov 2 2022,positive,excellent film the best i have seen in a while   great action and every minute is enjoyable
Nov 2 2022,positive,nice and fun  now the dceu has a rock they can lean on
Nov 2 2022,positive,not sure whats with review bombing  i did enjoy the theatre experience for this movie
Nov 2 2022,positive,the best movie ive seen in years rivals avengers dynamics only criticism is main villain at the end is in horrible cgi
Nov 2 2022,neutral,black adam is the kind of movie that your one friend that buys a new maddenfifa game every year tells you is awesome then you go and see it and are just left bored the amount of slow mo used is insane felt like i was watching a soon to be dead youtube channel treat your workers better roosterteeth the monstrous undead army being beaten by the uncle who kind of just walks off a bullet wound with some pcp pipe isnt even the dumbest part of the plot the acting apart from atom smasher is good but the story leaves you wanting to walk out
Nov 2 2022,positive,amazing action great special effects and ok story
Nov 2 2022,positive,all i can say is wow this was a action pack movie    the rock really delivered and not really much of fan of his movies    dont miss out on good movie because someone else opinion go check it yourself you wont be disappointed    hopefully we get more of lesserknown dc characters like we due with marvel    as a fan both dcmarvel dream see movies like this on the big screen with my kids
Nov 2 2022,positive,i actually have no idea what the critics are thinking with such poor ratings it has everything you need in a antisuperhero film with so much more
Nov 2 2022,positive,it is good and not the same as always in dc or marvel should continue with the franchise
Nov 2 2022,positive,interesting enough im committed bring on the sequel and its saga kudos to all the creatives designers and artist who worked those long hours at their desks to present us a phenomenal visualization of black adam
Nov 2 2022,positive,epic action perfect cast and an exceptional soundtrack
Nov 2 2022,positive,i found black adam to be an okay movie i feel like some of the criticism it gets is a bit too harsh but it is also not an amazing movie like some it out to be  the overall story is fairly good without giving too much away i enjoyed the plot of the anihero vs the heroes but i felt a lot of the jokes in this movie were really bad i didnt really laugh at this movie at all  i also thought it was good the way they made black adam seem like a real serious threat they done a good job at showing just how strong he is with some good action scenes  overall though i would say this was an okay watch nothing amazing but could have done with better jokes better side characters and slightly better story telling
Nov 2 2022,positive,really so much more than expected pretty damn great cant wait to see where this goes
Nov 2 2022,positive,4s for me because i felt i wanted more felt like i was watching the justice league for a minute because of the your a bad guy lets fight to lets team up and beat the obvious bad guyblack adam himself was badass and hawkman was amazing just felt story was blah and shows why marvel is way ahead of dc comics maverick and minions was better than this
Nov 2 2022,neutral,unfortunately extremely mediocre with a terrible script and lame villain
Nov 2 2022,positive,great action flick rock is a perfect casting
Nov 2 2022,positive,great action good acting good storyline     knew what to expect in the movie and got exactly that excited for a superman vs black adam showdown
Nov 2 2022,positive,a bit confusing lots of action the rock always rocks
Nov 2 2022,positive,the rock kills it in this movie awesome performance from the rock in a role he was born to play
Nov 2 2022,positive,it is refreshing to finally see a decent superhero  comicesque movie without the exorbitant wokeness that is currently trending in the super hero movies movies esp msheu it felt good to just go to a cinema and enjoy the actions sequences and new superheroes on the big screen without having to worry about the inclusion of woke factors mcu is already too tiresome to watch now and every phase 4 mcu film is so cringe and bad that black adam feels like a breath of fresh air    i dont know whats up with the critics maybe its because of the wokeness but when critics gave thor love and thunder and shehulk a fresh rating i lost my faith in them rt is relevant now only if we look at the audience score     comic book based movies are based for those who love comics and enjoy outoftheworld fantasy genre black adam was exactly thatand plus it got the man of steel back black adam is a fun movie to watch on the big screen i enjoyed it
Nov 2 2022,positive,it was a ton of fun surprisingly swift pacing and the special effect were so clean
Nov 2 2022,positive,a ton of fun surprisingly swift pacing too and the special effects were very clean
Nov 2 2022,positive,great action plot and story line
Nov 2 2022,positive,decent movie dc is always a little cheesy but the action and setting were cool i also love dwayne johnson stoked for the next one stay for the end credits
Nov 2 2022,positive,i enjoyed this movie and recommend it i am a fan of dwayne johnson and this movie doesnt disappoint
Nov 2 2022,positive,its one of the best dc movie since dark night and mos also there is superman in it lolx
Nov 2 2022,neutral,this would have been so much better with simply the rock you know doing what he does he had gravitas and an excellent screen presence but when they insisted on wedging in all these minor characters and the pointless trip to the mysterious arctic location just give us the rock
Nov 2 2022,positive,full of action some comedy great cast one awesome movie
Nov 2 2022,positive,enjoyed it very much more than expected
Nov 2 2022,positive,fun enough to watch for the rock and the special effects the kid was a super annoying character though
Nov 2 2022,positive,loved dewayne johnson but story was slow
Nov 2 2022,positive,lots of action with a few hints of comedy thrown in entertaining
Nov 2 2022,positive,epic way better than any marvel movie since endgame critics just dont like it cuz it doesnt force a political agenda on the audience and unlike the current marvel movies it actually follows the source material nonstop action and great performances from the rock and pierce brosnan
Nov 2 2022,positive,fantastic movie good to see the jsa on the big screen pierce took the spotlight as dr fate i never imagine that id see one of the entities of magic it is a really good movie overall
Nov 2 2022,positive,amazing the best superhéroe movie i ve seen in a long time and the rock is awesome
Nov 2 2022,positive,the backstory of teth adams black adam  beginnings were great reveals the true hero  within the story gave the character a deep  purpose im happy they took this route for black  adam versus the traditional villain role powered by  rage but still a centered sense of morality i  watched it with friends who dont read every comic  book out and they thoroughly enjoyed the movie as  well i dont understand the rt critics looking for movie craft elements in a comic book based movie for the fans who likeheard of the character and just want to enjoy a good movie this is it  there is no other way to showcase the super powers besides using cgi so disregard all the negative comments about the cgi usage  also to save people time theres only 1 post credit scene  yes its absolutely worth waiting for
Nov 2 2022,positive,very entertaining perfect vehicle for dwayne johnson nice backstory and secondary characters excellent casting of pierce brosnan and sara shari
Nov 2 2022,positive,dc has been on a pretty good run the past few years and black adam keeps that streak going the rock plays one of the best comic book characters on screen and the movie is jampacked with action and a great origin story the only thing that kept this from getting 5 stars is the abundance of slowmotion sequences that the dceu is well known for but gets old and just a few minor plot holes besides that the movie delivers and be sure to check it out on the biggest screen possible
Nov 2 2022,positive,it was ok but entertaining  not sure i would recommend it thoughd
Nov 2 2022,positive,wait at the end for a special clip 
Nov 2 2022,positive,it was a great dc movie and i thought the action and cgi was amazing
Nov 2 2022,positive,so worth the hype dope as hell
Nov 2 2022,positive,the story was a little slow for the first hour as they were building the background story as often is in action movies but as adam grows and starts working with the heroes he starts to grow on you by the end you are cheering him on and he becomes a hero it was well written and well directed i really enjoyed the movie and am glad i was able to see it
Nov 2 2022,positive,not the best movie ever but a good action film 
Nov 2 2022,positive,great action movie by the rock once again  loved seeing the justice society on the big screen finally as well  in addition to the upcoming black adam sequels it would also be great to see a justice society movie prequel and at least one for dr fate as well  dr fate is the most underutilized and one of the most fascinating dc heroes  pierce brosnan deserves a chance to bring his story to life on the big screen as well  hope to see those movies greenlighted soon as well or at least get there own mini series on hbo max like peacemaker did recently
Nov 2 2022,positive,critics dont know what theyre talking about such a great one
Nov 2 2022,positive,very good movie from dc in my opinion i recommend l
Nov 2 2022,positive,lots of visual effects but a very thin plot line
Nov 2 2022,positive,the kid ruined it for me but thr rest of the story and actors were excellent   
Nov 2 2022,positive,i liked the character and the action  the zombies were a bit much and unnecessary but i guess it was good because it bought all of the people together
Nov 2 2022,positive,the pacing was a bit weird and i felt there were a couple inconsistencies with the story
Nov 2 2022,positive,great action definitely kept me locked in
Nov 2 2022,positive,movie line and everything was good great acting did not disappoint like the last wonder woman movie a definite must see the surprise at the end is the credit is worth the wait
Nov 2 2022,negative,was it watchable sort of the first thirty minutes of the movie were near unwatchable thanks to the acting and backstory cgi was amazingtoptier evenbut the writing succeeded in pulling you out of the beautifully crafted kahndaq and it succeeded even more when the main kid was forced to say the cheesiest of lines i dont like blaming actors because they are just doing what they need to do to get paid but because of the writing it was rough in moments especially when they had to spoonfeed colonialism like people cant rub two brain cells together furthermore the only female heros powers were literally being pretty spinning around and moving wind for a good two seconds before they flitted back to the falconwannabe now hawkman rightfully should have been there but come on at least make him kinda different from the marvel counterpart anyways they tried to save her character from being a complete stereotype by making another one of her powers being smart but it really just fell into such a cliche that honestly it gets pretty disappointing especially from dc where i was expecting better i shouldnt thinking back to ww1984 the most sexist film of all time as with all recent dc movies it went on for about 45 minutes longer than necessary and yet somehow some way had halfbaked characters however i was pleasantly surprised by the rock as he didnt completely make me want to walk out i think it had something to do with how little lines he had all this to say unfortunately i am a dc fan so ill probably watch the next one anyways writhing and screaming hoping that they wont copy marvel for the umpteenth time    i just really want dc to stop letting actors write everything please please all you need is three nerds get afleck out of here
Nov 2 2022,positive,great movie the ending was fire
Nov 2 2022,positive,this critics got this one wrong black adam has me finally excited for dc movies great movie tell them the man in black sent you
Nov 2 2022,positive,this movie is how you the kids would say busing respectfully
Nov 2 2022,positive,a good superhero movie with high stakes and great action nothing mind blowing but better than i expected
Nov 2 2022,positive,black adam gives a whole new meaning to what it is to be a super hero
Nov 2 2022,positive,exciting action packed special effects extravaganza dwayne is a force as black adam but pierce brosnan and aldis hodge steal the show as dr fate and hawkman this movie had a lot of dc baggage to deal with but it rises above other dc titles such as suicide squad and even man of steel the movie has a 90s blockbuster feel to it and it is quite fast paced definitely one of my favorite dc titles
Nov 2 2022,positive,is this the greatest dc movie no is the the worst dc movie no this is just a good superhero movie    i do not feel that black adam will save the dceu or warner discovery i do feel that this is a fun movie though i find the introduction of the jsa to be interesting and the return of spoiler to be fan service at its finest i like the idea of black adam questioning the right of the jsa to save lives and i like the black adam does not give a fk    the weak parts of the movie the dialogue the editing and the lack of accent so the dialogue i understand the boy being a superhero fan and wanting to give adam a catchphrase but the constant need to shoehorn in the lines for the catchphrase is tiring the editing why is there a need for so much slow motion for cyclone it makes sense but the slowmo paint it black scene seemed to be added in reshoots and likened itself to a marvel movie no accent dwayne johnson has already portrayed an egyptian character in the past and did not do an accent for the role it wouldve shown johnsons range as an actor if he actually did an accent for this role    am i saying dont see the movie no i am saying see the movie immediately no this is just a fun movie that feels different enough from marvel and could be a good framework for the rest of the dceu ive faith in james gunn and what he has planned but see this movie if you want to just know that this movie is not the greatest superhero movie ever made
Nov 2 2022,positive,i think dwayne did an excellent job copying marvel tropes beat for beat and using every character used for marvel movies but even if you copy the ingredients you dont get the same meal
Nov 2 2022,positive,a fun and good dc movie for a change
Nov 2 2022,positive,great movie plenty of action and very little slow scenes
Nov 2 2022,positive,good acting action packed
Nov 2 2022,positive,great movie fun for the whole family
Nov 2 2022,positive,action scenes were awesome my son and i loved this movie i recommend you watch it
Nov 2 2022,negative,wasnt able to attend hope to soon
Nov 2 2022,positive,great movie just the right amount of over the top and campy comic book logic
Nov 2 2022,positive,i loved the dark edge to the movie it was better than anticipated the rock hit it out of the park
Nov 2 2022,positive,like shazam a super powered movie where it doesnt dwell too hard on being realistic felt like watching a comic my wife and i enjoyed it
Nov 2 2022,positive,it was good a lot of action
Nov 2 2022,positive,incredible truly one of if not the best superhero movies in the last 15 years critics has turned a blind eye to how this is actually a cinematic masterpiece
Nov 2 2022,positive,outstanding these film critics are full of crap movies are to entertain provided escape from an world that is bad enough without watching depressing message bull just as every john wayne movie was a hit with what counts the audience so is this and the rock  take your rotten tomatoes and shove them where the sun does not shine
Nov 2 2022,positive,i wasnt impressed at all with the trailer and i hate the namebut the movie was awesome  a must see i had whole body goosebumps at least ten times there wasnt anything i disliked about the movie except the name the special effects were great the dialog was great the acting was great i think it was the best role dwayne johnson has ever done   go see it before its gone
Nov 2 2022,positive,awesome ass kicking movie critics just dont get it
Nov 2 2022,positive,the movie was amazing and i really enjoyed it also ignore what the critics say cause theyre all racist trash who cry and whine about every little thing and they arent happy that there isnt any trashy woke propaganda in the movie which makes it really enjoyable because personally i love movies that do not have woke messages in them that are constantly forced down our throats if critics and anyone who wants to watch a woke movie go watch a history documentary k
Nov 2 2022,positive,great movie with outstanding effects
Nov 2 2022,positive,this was an extremely entertaining movie i dont know what rotten tomatoes is talking about rating it so low everyone that has seen it has been extremely satisfied and entertained
Nov 2 2022,positive,its wonderful great action good history
Nov 1 2022,positive,finally another hero movie based on what we wanna see  not some woke agenda  no politics just good action after being a long time fan of other universes which i have now abandoned i like seeing a movie that doesnt feel the need to pander to certain groups  dc will keep me coming back with movies like this  love d it
Nov 1 2022,positive,good bits of humour some story plots fell flat but overall a lot of fun
Nov 1 2022,positive,surprise characters and great theme  loved the actiontypical god like battles and effects  epic  loved it and cant wait for more  go dc
Nov 1 2022,positive,it is awesome and i really like the rocks performance in the movie
Nov 1 2022,positive,very entertaining flick no inyourface agendas  just pure fun a movie to watch at the theater
Nov 1 2022,positive,great film one of the best comic book movies in a while definitely worth seeing in the cinema
Nov 1 2022,positive,this was the movie dc needed to make a come back this was better than the majority of marvel movies and gave me black panther feelings  the rock made this role and i hope he makes a second appearance as black adam  the supporting cast were also great and finally made a universe to expand to   action and story packed its one of the best movies iv seen in a while and iv got cineworld unlimited so im there alot
Nov 1 2022,positive,a little bit of a rushed start but doesnt take away from the fact that this movie is epic expect to see a longer rated r version when its released for streaming
Nov 1 2022,positive,decent movie lots of great action dr fate is a standout and i feel atoms potential was wasted and dwayne johnson gave a serious but dull performence out of comfort of his usual expertise good movie good music and i recommend watching in cinemas
Nov 1 2022,positive,super fun movie definitely does not deserve such a low critic rating
Nov 1 2022,positive,i feel like the movie was made for people that read comics and already knew the characterswho the heck is dr fate  and how is this hawkman dude able to withstand the black adam beatdown that no one else can  the cyclone character was just eyecandy as her powers were useless  also how could the slave kid just give his shazam powers away
Nov 1 2022,positive,it was an overwhelming action chain that could be explored more deeply by trying to build a stronger bond between black adam and the khandar people besides that it is surely one of the best dc movies so far
Nov 1 2022,positive,i really enjoyed this movie this is the best dc movie so far black adam is a different super hero for sure
Nov 1 2022,positive,wonderful dc content need more movies like this that arent pushing the woke nonsense
Nov 1 2022,positive,amazing and refreshing take on the superhero genre with amazing firstinclass action scenes
Nov 1 2022,positive,if you like marval and dc movies i think you will like this
Nov 1 2022,positive,i love dwayne the rock johnson movies
Nov 1 2022,positive,black addam is awesome screw the toxic critics
Nov 1 2022,positive,era is changing for dcu waiting for more 
Nov 1 2022,positive,i thought it was a pretty good movie with quite a bit of action i normally dont watch superhero movies but i thought it was good
Nov 1 2022,positive,the movie was action packed  and also had a great story line
Nov 1 2022,negative,it just was not our cup of tea  bad
Nov 1 2022,positive,it is an uneven but generally good time if you turn you brain off and eat your popcorn your going to have fun
Nov 1 2022,positive,havent felt this way about a movie since avenger end game
Nov 1 2022,positive,i think the rock didnt send any free tickets free surprises and money to the critics so they burned him good a 50 point difference between the critics and the fans or everyone who went to watch the movie we should just get rid of and dump the critics because they suck bunch of old boring critics that dont like to have a good time and watch a good movie 50 points is embarrassing so dump the critics
Nov 1 2022,positive,if you watch black adam as a fan of the dc universe and a fan of the rock you will find it a perfect movie full of action and special effects but if you watch it as just an independent film you might find a superhero script that is more of the same   i liked it
Nov 1 2022,positive,great movie love the fight scenes and the side characters powers are unique and honestly tough lol
Nov 1 2022,positive,amazing fight sequences
Nov 1 2022,positive,it was action packed definitely worth the time it is a longer movie like any dc comic or marvel movie
Nov 1 2022,positive,this is the first time in a long time ive felt this hyped after seeing a super hero type movie  this is as such movies should be and i hope with all my heart it gets a sequel just as good  black adam is not a hero true but he was when it was needed and his home was in danger long live the champion  dont sleep on this movie
Nov 1 2022,positive,i think this is one of the best dc movies i have ever seen i recommend you to go watch it to the theaters
Nov 1 2022,negative,dwayne johnson plays boring character in boring movie that doesnt even look good in fact it looks awful few good ideas but as whole not my cup of tea i paid for a dc movie not for marvel
Nov 1 2022,positive,i love the movie a lot of action
Nov 1 2022,positive,black adam and justice society were simply awesome   the rest of story with the kid and the country could have been a bit better there were few cheesy scenes    overall a very entertaining movie
Nov 1 2022,positive,the special effects sfx mind blowing the story line was really good but why did pierce brosnan have to die boohoo a definitely must see i love the sardonic grin on dwayne johnson this guy can do anything
Nov 1 2022,negative,a truly creatively bankrupt film not a single original idea on display just scene after scene of things youve experienced in a hundred better movies all crammed into this bloated mess dont waste your time or money on this
Nov 1 2022,positive,black adam is arguably the best superhero movie since end game  and saying arguably might just be my marvel bias easily the best movie in the dceu not counting the snyder cut of justice league
Nov 1 2022,positive,the story line was a bit weakbut the introduction of black adam to the dc universe and  hollywood films offers some very exciting things for the futurei am excited to see what comes next
Nov 1 2022,positive,more than good the rock and the wing man are sexy 
Nov 1 2022,positive,lots of action  not boring  keeps you on your toes
Nov 1 2022,negative,i want to see the punisher with magic many plot hole the first king should be a demon when he dies the relic is too easy to find out but no one looking for in 5000 years etc
Nov 1 2022,positive,lots of action and dewayne johnson was fabulous
Nov 1 2022,positive,not bad worth a watch
Nov 1 2022,positive,it was great  i loved it
Nov 1 2022,positive,it was surprisingly over all really enjoyable the story matched up with the shazam story in a way to that way cool nice year old like it  so did i good action scenes
Nov 1 2022,positive,one of dcs best movies liled the twist on origin and time frame thought brosnan  was great as doctor fate some parts had a weird deadpoolxmen vibe the rock was amazing end credits gave me goosebumps
Nov 1 2022,negative,very action packed just lacking in decent story line a little ridiculous with the shazam back story
Nov 1 2022,positive,it was the best cinematic experience in a while plot was a bit repetitive but it all works out at the end with the amazing visuals and action sequences
Nov 1 2022,positive,if i could change the movie i would only make 2 changes which is almost nothing   1 the line of the man in black sent you felt a bit cheesy but i guess a younger crowd would like it   2 dr fate will be much stronger and survive i hope we will come back somehow other than this 2 things it was 2 hours of perfection loved it you could see the rock had passion i hope he will be in many dc movies now and that it will be more often
Nov 1 2022,positive,this movie was nice and is certainly good for something to go out and watch for fun but i imagine that it might have been a slight let down for devoted dc fans i thought the movie was very interesting but there were a couple of parts that were difficult to understand now this could just be due to the fact that i am not a devoted dc fan and am more of a marvel person myself but i am not sure i watched this movie mainly because it casted dwayne johnson as the main character so i was not disappointed in that aspect but it was definitely not one of the best movies ive seen him in while with the exception of a couple of plot holes or parts that i didnt understand it was a good movie i was slightly disappointed with this movie due to the lack of humor a couple jokes were thrown out here and there throughout the movie but it was mainly very serious which while this may be something some people enjoy was not for me overall it was a good movie for watching on a rainy day at the theatre which is what i did but is not for people with a large devotion to dc comics and movies also the popcorn at the theatre i went to was horridly disgusting so while not related to the movie whatsoever that dimmed the brightness of the experience slightly
Nov 1 2022,negative,i mean we all know this movie isnt good right i love the rock and pierce brosnan butwoof
Nov 1 2022,positive,it ran little slow but i enjoy every bit of the fighting seen and love it the best part was definitely henry showing up out of the blue as super man that really got me good
Nov 1 2022,positive,all round great movie
Nov 1 2022,positive,was not expecting what i saw absolutely glued to the big screen the entire runtime  may have to catch it again in a theater near me
Nov 1 2022,positive,if you love lots of action this movie is great for you but as far a story goes it was very sloppy with part of the story not lining up well black adam is not that great of a character their are a lot of great of characters overall it fun movie that is enjoyable but is not a masterpiece
Nov 1 2022,positive,plenty of actionwish the story was stronger
Nov 1 2022,positive,good graphics  good acting  great music great cast and great cameos not a dark movie not a light movie the movie playes in the gray color i recommend it
Nov 1 2022,positive,the movies okay but my worry is dc will end up like marvelwith a sprinkle of disney  pointless comedy moments which are not needed what i mean by marvel as they are now turn in to high five rich jockes    dj holds his own and you can see the pain he carries action good story line started off terrible but got better as the movie went along    the superman end credit was good but would of been better with man of steel theme and not the standard superman theme  all in all enjoyable
Nov 1 2022,positive,i went to see the rock and he was great in it but for the rest of the movie  i didnt had any expectations about the screenplay supporting cast etc just wanted to see a cool superhero movie and i got exactly that explosions and the rock flying and killing bad guys at last some superhero that when he sees a villain he ends him not puts him in jail so he can get out later on to wreak havoc on innocent civilians
Nov 1 2022,positive,black adam is a dumb fun good time with more then enough action to please any superhero fan and seeing new characters on the big screen for the first time further expands the dceu
Nov 1 2022,negative,promising start but ultimately a boring and pointless mess
Nov 1 2022,positive,i liked it a lot it sure it wasnt amazing or anything but after the bar dropped so low thanks to the likes of shehulk or rings of power witch rottentomatoes dont even allow us to criticizerate black adam is equivalent of spiderman 2 it was simply impossible to make it better
Nov 1 2022,positive,one the best movie in dceu
Nov 1 2022,positive,action was pretty good sfx at times was very good and at times not great sountrack was awesome acting was good as well
Nov 1 2022,negative,i dont walk out of many movies but this was one of them  a shame really cuz i do generally like the rocks movies and at their worst they are still entertaining enough to kill 90120 minutes  this movie was just a mess from the start and the darkcloudy cgi has worn out its welcome in the dcu i no doubt believe dc fans will love this movie just as marvel fans love theirs regardless of how convoluted and tired the story is or how poorly it is executed
Nov 1 2022,positive,i loved the fun i had anticipating what was to happen i was imagining a bloody show yes many kills but they were the bad guys but got something with heart from many characters it was everything i hoped for and was really happy with the results and wondering now what is going to happen next there were some really good surprises and i loved every one yes superman is back and cant wait to see whats next for everyone as dc is hopefully finally on the right track starting right now cant wait to see shazam meets black adam meets superman and everyone else a great popcorn movie leave your brains at home and just have fun
Nov 1 2022,positive,black adam was a great movie for what it was the characters were very entertaining this is better than most of the things that marvel has came up with recently in my opinion this is a win for dc
Nov 1 2022,negative,once you get past the awful story and the fact that the rock cant act his way out of a wet paper bag the movie was a nice introduction to the jsa  pierce brosnans dr fate was the highlight of the movie  it was a cool introduction to hawkman but at least in the comics hawkman wouldnt have lasted 30 seconds against black adam  and while atom smasher and not red tornado were visually well done they were clearly out of their league in this one and they would have been better off sending some stronger members to take on a threat as big as black adam
Nov 1 2022,positive,great super hero movie  great action movie too even the comedy was on point probably the best dc movie yet
Nov 1 2022,positive,if this is not the best then idk what else is the best  like me there are many peoples dont know about how teth adam becomes black adam  and rock make this character absolute beauty 
Nov 1 2022,positive,loved hawkman dr fate superb adam smasher cyclon henry winkler black adam my kids loved it great mid credit scene etc thank you
Nov 1 2022,positive,thoroughly enjoyed it lots of action and great special effects the movie score was on point too well done dwayne johnson keep listening to the fans as this is dc comics time to shine
Nov 1 2022,negative,im kind of disappointed i thought this movies supposed to be the rocks baby poor dialogues and under developed characters
Nov 1 2022,positive,masterpiece for dc awesome movie
Nov 1 2022,positive,this movie was what black panther should have been i dont mean bp should have mimicked this plot it just had all the perfect elements its my new favorite superhero movie over superman and captain america it had more heart than both to me it doesnt follow black adams actual storyline from the comics but its actually better in my opinion the characters did exactly what i felt they should take care of their own nation and tell the foreign heroes to shove it the countrys been occupied for 27 years and no superhero has come to liberate them then they want to take adam away because they dont like his style it wasnt a soft movie and rock made me feel for the character made me rethink how i do things myself at the end where he liberates the people the supporting cast did a great job too i figured out who the bad guy was very early but he still surprised me and i loved what happened with the final battle i wondered if hawkman had originally been black and while thats not the case its more realistic in my opinion not because a white dude couldnt be from egypt but typically i dont think they are the movie didnt feel like the woke propaganda shoved down our throats today and for the record im black and muslim it was an old fashioned movie that just inspires you by being good i might go to the theater and see it again ive only done that once i can see any movie for free but i paid because of a review from someone else and id pay again
Nov 1 2022,positive,not the perfect movie but its fun and masculine and no woke messaging i will go rewatch it again
Nov 1 2022,positive,very entertaining first time seeing dwayne johnson playing a serious murdering role ever actor seems to enjoy their time in this one i recommend watching its a good direction for dc no wokeness was a great plus just a great movie all around
Nov 1 2022,positive,i liked it alot  it could have been better it had huge potential partially wasted
Nov 1 2022,positive,one of the best movies ive ever seen totally an anti hero kills people and is politically incorrect especially now about the forced inclusion on all sides thats why people loved this movie
Nov 1 2022,positive,i really enjoyed the graphics of the film i also liked that dwayne johnsons demeanor remained the same throughout the film
Nov 1 2022,positive,dont care what critics think i loved this movie absolutely amazing
Nov 1 2022,positive,it was absolutely great and not as bad as what to what others expected before it came out it may have not been the best movie in 2022 but its still up there
Nov 1 2022,positive,this movies was as i expected an actionfun flick without the need to have origin stories for each characteri realy realy enjoyed it with my family
Nov 1 2022,positive,i think its everything you could ask for in a super hero movie or antihero however you look at it it didnt disappoint just enjoy and relax i would see it again
Nov 1 2022,negative,spoilers  i was very disappointed by this film given the expectation with the rock being a main character and a producer i had high hopes unfortunately it fell into the all too common category that a lot of dc films seem to fall into it passed the time but it didnt engage me and i considered leaving partway through   there were a few key issues that lead to this experience for me firstly there was a decent amount of back story for teth adam leading me to feel he was a hero to the people but there was no backstory on the supposed heroes that came in to make teth adam surrender and so i felt no allegiance or connection to these characters in fact i felt they were closer to the villain line than teth adam given how the people of kahndaq had been under military rule for 27 years without any intervention from these socalled heroes i felt this lack of connection and investment in the characters was a major flaw in the development of the film   in addition it seemed the justice alliance was shown to be quite redundant when it came to defeating the true enemy and actually only teth adam could defeat him there was no team work or development to team work at all and because we didnt know the heroes well at all you couldnt gauge their strength and power so they just seemed pretty pathetic   furthermore a lot of the dialogue was very poorly written times when there were meant to be significant lines or poignant moments were shattered with poor choice of words or dialogue that made no sense it just felt cringy to listen to   finally the reactivation of teth adams powers took so long to actually happen and was so physiologically inaccurate that i was bored waiting for him to get involved i wasnt excited or thrilled that he was back i even considered leaving partway through it   overall it was a very disappointing hero movie with poor character development flimsy dialogue and left the audience disconnected from characters youd want them to invest in
Nov 1 2022,positive,rock is really rocks in this movie  he is best in his role as black adam  casting is amazing  dr fate is also amazing really a good movie with magic and action
Nov 1 2022,positive,dc finally doing things in the daytime fr good start
Nov 1 2022,positive,as far as big budget superhero movies go black adam was average at best mediocre plot cheesy dialogue and characters that were quite frankly almost impossible to care about made this feel like a 90s throwback    i mean it was entertaining enough but certainly wont be remembered in months to come
Nov 1 2022,positive,i enjoyed it not the greatest story ever written but i was entertained through the whole movie it was worth the price of admission i enjoyed this movie enough that if they make a black adam part 2 then i will go and watch it
Nov 1 2022,positive,does a great job of establishing ba timeline and bis positioning doesnt over reach and delivers a simple super hero package with all the fighting you could ask for
Nov 1 2022,positive,action comedy dark humor along with a fantastic casts pulls this epic together unlike most dc movies i loved this movie more than any  dc movie in the past 10 or so years
Nov 1 2022,positive,amazing movie love it very much   hope in the future to see more movies like this one 
Nov 1 2022,positive,great action and character setting  feels like the start of a new dc universe  strongly recommend
Nov 1 2022,negative,the movie was frankly a parody weve reached rock bottom folks this movie assures it little to no plot zero character development at times i wondered what the hell i was even watching dwayne was not redeeming there was no depth i mean none zero maybe an ai cut this movie it was seemingly random cgi was bad directing worse literally there is nothing good about this movie who wrote the script i cant believe this is what passes for an acceptable script who the hell green lit this script its nothing
Nov 1 2022,negative,wow what a hilarious movie  it was so terrible that we just laughed our heads off
Nov 1 2022,positive,best dc movie by far aside from some batman movies all in all top contender easily
Nov 1 2022,positive,non stop action dc darkness no holding back my son and i saw it together had a great time then we played injustice 12 afterwards marvel is trash now to much woke propaganda dc is back go see black adam  screw the criticts
Nov 1 2022,positive,i love the super heromatrix affects  lots of suspense the entire movie
Nov 1 2022,negative,very disappointed in pretty much every aspect of this lame effort weak story overdone cgi i was expecting more from a dwayne johnson movie
Nov 1 2022,positive,in my opinion its the best dcu movie the critics dont whats good and whats bad
Nov 1 2022,positive,the film is wellcrafted wellwritten script just some cgi effects that went bad
Nov 1 2022,negative,absolute garbage  ridiculous story and horrible acting make this one of the worst superhero movies ever made  dc clearly has no idea how to make a superhero movie
Nov 1 2022,positive,amazing movie must watch
Nov 1 2022,positive,the movie was fast paced but in doing so created some good relationships among characters we have not yet met on screen the humour was timely and not overdone the rock makes a great entrance into the dc world
Nov 1 2022,positive,pretty cool and enjoyed the movie
Nov 1 2022,positive,i went to see it tonight love it
Nov 1 2022,positive,loved it  i will definitely be seeing it again
Nov 1 2022,positive,not bad at all awesome action decent acting except for the lady the mother of the kid and they kept the jokes funny and controlled they abused of slomo shots but its bearable  all in all a pretty decent comics movie way better than ww84 for sure
Nov 1 2022,positive,one the most brutal  entertaining superhero movies out there the way he takes down his enemies are awesome especially how the last boss goes really loved it coz this is exactly what i was hoping for5 stars all day long
Nov 1 2022,positive,refreshing and it gave me hope for dc probably one of my top 5 superhero movies of all time
Nov 1 2022,positive,hands down one of the best dc movies the effects and action was great the storyline was good as it had a few unexpected twists loved the fact viola  davis continued from suicide squad and was in it liked the link to a few other dc characters really enjoyed it
Nov 1 2022,positive,the rock lots of fighting great side characters and a metaphor about the states what more do you want
Nov 1 2022,positive,this movie is dwayne the rock johnsons best movie performance so far in my opinion
Nov 1 2022,positive,amazing action from start till the end i like the rocks performance will like for him to continue in this franchise
Nov 1 2022,positive,this is one of my favorite dceu movies the cgi was great the action was great dwayne was great i wish dr fate was less dr strange but pierce brosnan played the role well you can tell there was a ton of effort put into this movie and the critics reviews at 40 are a shame much worse movies get much better ratings
Nov 1 2022,positive,the rock is on point  and superman at the end screams part 2
Nov 1 2022,positive,it was good i enjoyed his no care attitude and got it done the scenes are good and dark humor always a plus
Nov 1 2022,positive,i honestly loved the movie its been a long time since a dc movie left me so excited and happy congratulations to the rock who is building an incredible universe for dc and all the other producers
Nov 1 2022,positive,very entertaining lots of action i enjoyed it
Nov 1 2022,positive,just a good movie no complaints
Nov 1 2022,positive,the story line and special effects were incredible
Oct 31 2022,positive,i enjoyed black adam  the plot was good and the action scenes were great
Oct 31 2022,positive,we enjoyed the movie  the characters were well defined and storyline was good
Oct 31 2022,positive,very good movie presents the main characters well lots of action could have explored some secondary characters better overall its a movie that brings what moviegoers want to see an excellent translation of the comics without changing the essence of the black adam
Oct 31 2022,positive,i loved it i would definitely recommend it and go watch it again
Oct 31 2022,positive,actionpacked funny great storyline  the rock at his best
Oct 31 2022,positive,outstanding performance and fx a great movie will watch again
Oct 31 2022,positive,it was a great movie plenty of action a great antihero the justice council had great superheros and the movie didnt try to shove any messages down my throat good clean fun
Oct 31 2022,positive,i could see many moments were id agree with critics such as the final fight and other points the movies strongest and best points of plot would have to be the justice society and their relationship
Oct 31 2022,positive,absolutely great movie
Oct 31 2022,positive,great music great actors the story and some scenes make reference to movies on the 2000s for those who feel nostalgic for that kind of movies its a go for orthers it might not hold for them but in general you spend a fun time
Oct 31 2022,positive,great movie really enjoyed it was much more serious than other films starring the rock
Oct 31 2022,positive,very good movie it was worth to watch it
Oct 31 2022,negative,if it wasnt for the rock this movie wouldnt have made it  pretty mediocre doesnt compare to marvel movies
Oct 31 2022,positive,dude i genuinely feel like the critics were just out to sht on this movie it was fun objectively good and aside from that kids speech i genuinely struggled to find any real issues with it i really enjoyed it and am honestly confused on why someone wouldnt
Oct 31 2022,positive,so   1 star for the rock because he is awesome  1 star for special effects  doctor fate  1 star an ok attempt at story   1 star for race for unnecessarily  1 star for gender swapping unnecessarily     i do love to see the rock on screen despite him playing various characters they are always at least a little bit of the rock this wasnt a groundbreaking movie but the special effects were cool and so was seeing dr fate the story was pretty average but by the same token most 1st movies are tough when it comes to super heroes they didnt try to make politics the focus of this movie and only some woke stuff made it in 2 stars for woke stuff that didnt belong
Oct 31 2022,positive,easy to watch entertaining fun film full of action   loved the cast and looking forward to the next movie
Oct 31 2022,positive,excellent movie dc is finally starting to catch up the rock was born to play a superhero
Oct 31 2022,negative,the rock is a one trick pony acting was not even tempted it was dewayne johnson as the rock as black adam 
Oct 31 2022,positive,this movie is amazing
Oct 31 2022,positive,heres what i have to say to the critics go find another job because clearly you either have poor eyesight or absolute poor taste either way this movie was an adventure only so few movies unlike this one have left me wanting more this movie however fulfilled everything that it was aiming for only hope for a sequel
Oct 31 2022,positive,amazing movie i recommend to watch it giving 45 half stars because there is not much depth in the character development of the jsa i would have preferred if there was more background story and not so many characters would have been introduced at the same time
Oct 31 2022,positive,my expectations were low for this movie but oh boy did it prove me wrong i know the first movie is always a set up for the next and im greatly looking forward to the next one i feel like this performance was the rocks best i could tell that he really took this role seriously and put his heart and soul into it i dont know whats wrong with the critics when it comes to this movie but if i were you id ignore them and just go see it listen to the audiance we know better
Oct 31 2022,positive,it was great movie one of the best dc movies so far tons of action tons of fun
Oct 31 2022,positive,action packed little cheesy at times but great movie nonetheless
Oct 31 2022,positive,best dc movie in a long time
Oct 31 2022,positive,ok movie  non stop action and all seems to happen in one day just like all the other superhero movies do personally there is so much damage and death its kind of funny to call any of them heroes also side note there was back ground music continuously throughout the film kind of annoying
Oct 31 2022,positive,a refreshing bold twist on the cookie cutter hero genre and ideals
Oct 31 2022,positive,great movie looking forward to the sequel
Oct 31 2022,positive,i think its a movie with a lot to grow in the future i feel people is taking to serious about movies and forget that is fiction it supous to entertain and it was
Oct 31 2022,positive,very nice spectacle with a weak and predictable script it all rides on the visuals
Oct 31 2022,positive,missing the last half star because i really would have prefered the pointy adam ears but most stars are just for the promise of henry cavills superman it was awesome
Oct 31 2022,positive,the movie is fun with some questions about whats the limit of a hero its a must see
Oct 31 2022,positive,its a movie where you see what youre waiting for and more no tedious parts and no wasting time a movie that the dc universe was in need of
Oct 31 2022,positive,great move the best i have seen from dc in a while and better than the current marvel movies at least the last few 
Oct 31 2022,neutral,i watched because of the rock i also like the idea that not every hero has to be perfect but overall i would not watch again the jokes fell short and the story was not captivating enough for me i was also disappointed that the rock did not bring his usual charisma
Oct 31 2022,positive,i honestly dont understand the critical reception of the movie    the casting was onpoint the story was good the sfx were worked as well   it wasnt great but it wasnt meant to be its a fine popcorn flick for families to enjoy and on that level it succeeded tremendously
Oct 31 2022,positive,super fun to watch the rock as black adam just destroy people and be a formidable force to superman and the justice league
Oct 31 2022,positive,this is the first movie ive seen by dwayne johnson ive been disappointed in  there was so much cgi that it should have just been an animated movie and been done with it
Oct 31 2022,neutral,meh the plot was too confusing the story seemed awkward and the cinematography was not interesting enough
Oct 31 2022,negative,just wasnt very good
Oct 31 2022,negative,good special effects the only thing that can be said to be good are the special effects the films script is very weak and doesnt know how to take advantage of its characters  its a waste of time
Oct 31 2022,positive,rock was awesome as black adam eagerly waiting for shazam  superman vs black adam 
Oct 31 2022,positive,loved this movie shouldve been longer i plan on seeing it again
Oct 31 2022,positive,i did not expect anything out of this film but it was quite a surprise and pierce brosnans dr fate carried the whole thing even though the story is quite classical i liked the twist  i also really liked the fact that the action was somehow brutal not the usual censured fights we are used to in the last years superhero movies and shows
Oct 31 2022,positive,loved everybody of it
Oct 31 2022,positive,it was good it moves along
Oct 31 2022,neutral,i had hope for this movie but i was definitely baited by the trailers the acting was good story sure but this definitely should have had a few movies before it so the other character would have some history for the audience a recurring thought throughout the movie was who are these turkeys why introduce a character dr fate who seems to be heavily grounded and a leader of some sort of team jsa just to kill him off in the same movie there was little to no feeling for his death or anything he really did because who is this guy
Oct 31 2022,positive,great superhero movie a lot better than what mcu is putting out
Oct 31 2022,positive,absolutely loved this movie
Oct 31 2022,positive,turn your brain off dont over think it sit back enjoy the non stop super powered fighting this is a real super hero movie strait to the point and straight to the fist

Oct 31 2022,positive,great movie great experience i just loved it
Oct 31 2022,positive,loved this movie the rock does an amazing job and this was a very entertaining movie to watch
Oct 31 2022,positive,black adam  its an action movie about superheros was released on october 22nd 2022  the film is about an ancient hero who come to help the people of kahndaq free themselves from their conqueror its an action movie and fun to watch with friends  i give it five stars its a really good movie and i recommend watching it with friends  in deed this is cinema 
Oct 31 2022,positive,probably the best work dj has donelots of great fight scenes
Oct 31 2022,neutral,boring story but veey good action scenes villain was total trash dc what are you doing
Oct 31 2022,positive,its a classic superhero movie with modern special effects despite poor critic reviews i found this very entertaining took three young kids and my girlfriend to see it and everyone had a great time highly recommended
Oct 31 2022,positive,dc fan and rock fan  awesome movie
Oct 31 2022,positive,best dc movie besides batman in a yeeears     had a ton of fun watching this in imax
Oct 31 2022,positive,lots of action good storyline and messages second time seeing it my opinion is a bit biased as im a fan of the dc character but definitely worth seeing
Oct 31 2022,positive,fun popcorn film the action was great
Oct 31 2022,positive,would watch again and again  excellent to see in xd
Oct 31 2022,negative,the biggest movie about nothing terrible in every way
Oct 31 2022,positive,good superhero movie of 2022 this movie slaps with me it is funny and entertaining in every way possible i didnt know y critics hate on it
Oct 31 2022,positive,loved the movie
Oct 31 2022,positive,solidly entertaining superhero movie i feel similar to aquaman after watching it but it isnt a reskin if it doesnt getto far from the usual superhero tropes  exciting energetic and enjoyable if not deep brilliant and unique
Oct 31 2022,positive,prolly best dc movie out although could of had a better fight at the end but all in all great movie 
Oct 31 2022,negative,too much action so you cant tell when the final batle begins also is realy bad
Oct 31 2022,positive,fun movie to watch the movie has it flaws however its strengths definetly out shines it dceu is looking good for the future if this is the kind of movies its producing
Oct 31 2022,positive,loved it  do wish they flushed out jsa members  but i loved seeing the jsa on big screen especially dr fate  hopefully he and the other members show up in later films with hawk girl please  cost this one star  4 stars for seeing the peoples champion being the peoples champion with powers
Oct 31 2022,positive,funny   enjoyed the rock as hero
Oct 31 2022,positive,black adams story is a basic superhero movie which yeah makes sense but i think personally where it really shines is the combat and thankfully thats what it focuses on instead of focusing on the same dried out story all superhero movies do they focus on the action and oh my god is it good watched in theaters and i couldnt take my eyes off of it and even the generic ass story its actually fairly enjoyable and does some things most generic movies dont not a must see but i totally recommend it 100
Oct 31 2022,positive,black adam is very very good
Oct 31 2022,positive,my grandchildren were so enthralled with this movie i loved listening to them discuss the difference between mortal and immortal
Oct 31 2022,positive,fantastic storytelling amazing visual and sound effects and enjoyable characters
Oct 31 2022,negative,the plot is poor but what killed it for me were the abysmal attempts at accents and the fact that black adam could speak english despite having never heard it in his 5000 year slumber
Oct 31 2022,positive,went into it with the expectation of living up to shazam  it did not disappoint
Oct 31 2022,positive,this movie was a dichotomy of mixed signals on one hand dc tried to maintain the darker aspects of zack snyders original vision there were the familiar aspects of the human side of how the heroes affect the daytoday lives of the people they protect i loved this part of the film the action was excellent and dwayne johnson delivered     on the other hand dc seemed confused and unwilling to commit to this vision the campy aspects of the justice society were annoying it was meant to be comic relief but just took me out of the movie my advice is to stop trying to do a marvel movie im glad walter hamada is out as president of dc because it felt like he was trying to transition the dceu from the snyder vision to the campy steamy pile of dookie that brought us the joss wheaton justice league     overall i loved this movie i didnt completely buy into the justice society as the good guys but they werent so terrible that id rate this movie below 4 stars
Oct 31 2022,positive,great movie brutal funny and the cgi was great as well hopefully dc goes this route with the route of their movies
Oct 31 2022,positive,such an epic movie seriously one of the best out there if not the best everything about it was magnificent love this movie love the cast and love the rock fantastic story im so loving it and glad to see the dceu back in action
Oct 31 2022,positive,good movie the rock is perfect as black adam storyline went about off course a little bit especially when the annoying kid who i didnt care much about becomes the center of the storyline   still good though and great ending with superman facing off against black adam    looking forward to a second black adam 2 hopefully especially if hes facing off against superman
Oct 31 2022,negative,i left boring and it was almost a carboncopy of mcu even the costumes were similar
Oct 31 2022,negative,aweful movie would not recommend it to anyone
Oct 31 2022,positive,very good movie with an entertaining third act incredible twists soundtrack and cinematography carry this movie higher than it could have reached even with the considerable talent of peirce brosnan and dwayne johnson
Oct 31 2022,positive,i loved black adam and have seen it twice now its just good clean family fun without all the preachy agenda pushing its not an overcomplicated artsy movie just action packed fun
Oct 31 2022,positive,very entertaining movie with cool visuals hawkman and fate were big highlights in the film the rock looks amazing in the role
Oct 31 2022,positive,dawyne johnson is not a good actor he can have a good body but not a good performance
Oct 31 2022,positive,very impressive applause for dr fate
Oct 31 2022,positive,great movie good story and some excellent special effects the rock was an almost perfect pick for the roles
Oct 31 2022,positive,this movie was actually good  to be clear i am not a dc fan especially as of late but black adam was everything that made marvel great but forgot with recent films im going to see it again
Oct 31 2022,positive,it was refreshing and thoroughly entertaining it was a treat to see the justice society in the big screen for the very first time dwayne johnson truly embodies the persona of black adam and may have also reelectrified the dceu
Oct 31 2022,positive,this movie is exactly what i wanted when dwayne johnson said he is starring in black adam it is action and action and more action perfect cgi and every character was legit taken from the comics i loved black adam
Oct 31 2022,positive,i dont know which movie the critics saw but it wasnt the same as the audience black adam is fun actionpacked and with an exciting ending
Oct 31 2022,positive,very nice movie with great action scenes and good sarcastic humor wanna see that black adam vs superman
Oct 31 2022,positive,the movie was so good and was all action   this is what dc needed
Oct 31 2022,neutral,the movie is definitely above average in terms of its thrilling action and somewhat realistic cgi however the story might be generic and just not as entertaining especially with the boy and his mum the justice society was interesting for sure but there were 2 characters that were very underused despite that i would love to see them working side by side once again in future projects one character met his end but i hated that he had to go considering the fact that many people and i were interested in seeing him again i cannot really say much for the villain because he did not really get much to do the post credit scene was underwhelming but somewhat unexpected i was expecting someone else to appear in conclusion i would have preferred to watch this at home instead of spending money to watch it in the cinema
Oct 31 2022,positive,possible a new start point for the dc
Oct 31 2022,positive,ive been waiting for this for a long time cgi and the whole setup is perfectly made really enjoyed this movie
Oct 31 2022,negative,it was good but i removed a star because they copied a ton of marvel scenes to the point that its not good without the scenes that they stole
Oct 31 2022,positive,it had some story problems mainly its like they tried to cram too much in which are it feel muddled still pretty good compared with dcs track record and dwayne johnson was born for the role
Oct 31 2022,positive, once again the critics were wrong about this one this is what happens when your work is going to the movies versus watching a movie to escape work and be entertained   i get it you want to think and be challenged at work  and thats why critics love the green knight and the lobster while audiences were meh about them the rest of us are not at work though we enjoy suspending disbelief and being whisked away by amazing action good acting and cgi   this movie didnt deserve the empty theatre i just left undoubtably caused by the panning received by critics   are you not entertained not every movie has to be suitable for sundance or an art festival  my first review because i felt i had to stand up to this injustice 55 
Oct 31 2022,positive,pretty much what i expected from a dwayne johnson movie 
Oct 31 2022,positive,i loved this film  it was time for someone to show what the super hero movie is and how much fun it is to see  sick of money hiring directors who think trying to find something they want to do in a super hero movie is the same thing as being able to add something fresh to a super hero movie destined for its blockbuster summer  stop hiring hacks who think their journals are interesting inserts  bring the old guys out of retirement if you have to but you dont  hire guys that want to make good super hero movies like this and let people whod rather be somewhere else have the freedom they need to frigging leave  dont feed em
Oct 31 2022,positive,great action great story and awesome special effects this was one big thrill ride and a special treat at the end credits 
Oct 31 2022,positive,on of best superhero movies made for only viewers to entertain not for hollywood pandits
Oct 31 2022,positive,solid popcorn flick great cameo in the end
Oct 31 2022,positive,it was actually amazing i went in skeptical about it due to the reviews ive seen but it turned out to be hilarious great action sequences with an awesome cast i cant wait to see more
Oct 31 2022,positive,it was so badass loved it my grand kids loved it
Oct 31 2022,positive,good movie they should cut on the cgi and its kinda lacking but overall its good
Oct 31 2022,positive,great movie with a great story liked every bit of it good wins over evil and evil was destroyed
Oct 31 2022,positive,great movie the rock kick ass
Oct 31 2022,positive,i was caught off guard with how good this movie was it might be the best hero movie ive ever watched an instant favorite for me
Oct 31 2022,positive,so much better than i was expecting thank you dc for setting the bar so low
Oct 31 2022,positive,cool moments but lacked in emotion fun popcorn movie
Oct 31 2022,positive,superman comes in the ending scene 
Oct 31 2022,positive,amazing effects awesome action and ok plot
Oct 31 2022,positive,i really live the 4th experience it really the movie alive
Oct 31 2022,positive,its a fresh hit in this avalanche of trash movies of marvel its a good superhero movie just action and the rock without innecesary social propaganda    im not a native english speaker so sorry for that 
Oct 31 2022,positive,this movie was amazing the best movie since end game and thats saying a lot it has action a great back story and heart what a combination im watching it over and over again
Oct 31 2022,positive,fun to watch but even as a comic the story was weak sauce
Oct 31 2022,positive,slow at the beginning but really good
Oct 31 2022,positive,black adam is far from a perfect movie but it is still a goofy and fun time i enjoyed dwayne johnsons addition to the dc lineup enough to say it is worth watching i feel like the story is a bit messy and it definitely is heavily reliant on cgifueled action but it is a decent movie to turn your brain off and enjoy the spectacle the humor actually works decently well in this movie and generally fits with whats going on the movie doesnt get stuck in the origin story formula too much which makes it have its own voice overall it is a pretty silly movie that isnt among the best from dc but is still a fun way to pass the time
Oct 31 2022,positive,i have no idea what the critics are talking about i had so much fun watching this film its not perfect but i totally feel as theres bias when it comes to dc attempting to make great superhero flicks see this film for yourselves and have a great time i know i did
Oct 31 2022,positive,awesome movie and plot with a lot of action and nice to see another ethnic superhero
Oct 31 2022,positive,the rock makes an astounding character with a main character beyond the moral limitations of cliche superheroes finding its purpose in a credible way and with great interventions of other support characters each of one a piece of a great team with the classic hero the mentor and the apprentices a must see
Oct 31 2022,positive,dont believe the critics awesome movie with a lot of action and a great story
Oct 31 2022,positive,it was really an awesome movie if youre looking for a good time and knowing youre about to watch a superhero movie
Oct 31 2022,positive,great movie exactly what you want to see in a superhero movie it had lots of good action scenes and i think what is underrated about the film is how it also gave other characters like dr fate and hawkman to shine all while keeping black adam as its main focal point it also has a good plot which keeps the movie fun and interesting
Oct 31 2022,positive,honestly didnt expect much from this movie i only wanted to see it for the rock but like i was blown away the acting from some of the minor characters is kinda iffy tbh but the main cast the ones you actually want to see is very good especially the villains and the rock himself the fights scenes actually hit hard every punch feel heavy and the cgi is top notch so good see it if your looking for a great time
Oct 31 2022,negative,literally walked out of the theater on this moviejust endless actionso boring  another fast an furious movie with the rock lol
Oct 31 2022,positive,great action but wonky story stay for the end will make you excited for the next one
Oct 31 2022,neutral,decent movie as introductory superhero movies go but not worth the price of seeing a movie after 6pm
Oct 31 2022,positive,its illuminating the critics for most part give most marvel movies top reviews but dc gets not love this movie is solid and way better than shangchi or the eternals the rating of regular movie goers is spot on hey critics stop riding the mcu fan boy wave and get your head out of the sand 
Oct 31 2022,positive,this movie was entertaining i hear some people picking at it but for someone like me who doesnt analyze a movie to death  but instead just watch and either enjoy it or not i thought it was had good action and the story line which had a little twist to it had me interested the whole time im not a comic book guy and i knew nothing about this character but i do like super hero movies and this was one of the best ones ive seen this year so far
Oct 31 2022,negative,wow another movie where the rock plays the rock how very original every movie dwayne johnson appears in he plays it the same its weird seeing the same character in so many movies what is the reason i am confusion     honestly if i could give it less than 1 star i would the entire movie was choppy at best the storyline goes back and forth trying to make black adam the villain is he a villain nah theres another villain it was a hot dumpster fire
Oct 31 2022,positive,magnificent movie they really deliver to the fans what they asked for from beginning to end action without limits the story will give for an excellent part    thank you i had a great time
Oct 31 2022,positive,great action and good storyline nice assist from other heroes which made it worthwhile not quite marvel caliber but better than expected much better than shazam
Oct 31 2022,negative,bad actors  classic dc movie no real sequence and fights so predictable
Oct 31 2022,positive,definitely just saw it for the second time and for a dc super hero movie it was exactly whats needed to jump start everything back in the right direction must see for so many reasons
Oct 31 2022,positive,the first day i read a horible  review about this moviewas not sure what to expect fyiloved itaction packed was wondering what movie that person watched  great job dc
Oct 31 2022,positive,i loved the fun dialogue good pacing  i always love the rock  the child actors did a great job
Oct 31 2022,positive,oh no i must give up my power  oops we should not have forced that on you  easy to spot but very enjoyable
Oct 31 2022,positive,i really liked it had lots of action and was funny in some spots my son really enjoyed it as well it will be one i add to my collection
Oct 31 2022,positive,critics should stop being bias this is a popcorn action movie that delivers what it intends to
Oct 31 2022,positive,its a great movie critics need to stop being so up them selves
Oct 31 2022,positive,it was a great movie  full action  and the best stars of the word  obviously talking about henry too  yesss superman its back 
Oct 31 2022,positive,wow the rock did an astonishing job on this movie and the fight scenes were action packed its a really great dc movie
Oct 31 2022,positive,an exhilarating ride of action
Oct 31 2022,positive,as a longtime comic fan this was a great movie i love the direction that dcu is going with this and excited for the future 
Oct 31 2022,positive,this movie hits the main concept of a superhero movie while establishing the fact that the main character isnt even a hero just amazing from the filmmaker it was beyond enjoyable to watch and there was little to no boring moment scenes each scene was linked perfectly to the others just outstanding
Oct 31 2022,positive,the rock is epic other actors was good
Oct 31 2022,positive,loved this movie a lot definitely a must see i dont agree with the critics are saying about it
Oct 31 2022,positive,this is an awesome movie the action in the movie is very good
Oct 31 2022,positive,cool action special effects were ok story was just meh and i feel like i should have cared more than i did about a character dying at the end but i justdidnt    cool concept but i was mostly disappointed in the execution still fun to watch though it passed the time shrugs
Oct 31 2022,positive,it was very good i went there expecting a good movie and ended up with a great movie i actually went twice to the cinema awesome superhero movie
Oct 31 2022,positive,it was quite interesting to view the dark side of a super hero for change  the fight scenes were good
Oct 31 2022,positive,i didnt love it nor did i hate it i was bored by a little less than half of the movie the fighting scenes gave me a live action version of the injustice games which redeemed the movie for me i was entertained
Oct 31 2022,positive,great movie the plot twist is mind blowing
Oct 31 2022,positive,fun engaging and action packed black adam feels like a film that dc created to show dc fans like myself another timeline and another part of the dc universe dwayne johnsons role as black adam was a very different role for him considering he has never played a super powered character
Oct 31 2022,positive,entertaining and fun  a great start for a new antihero
Oct 31 2022,positive,it was amazing  my grandson and i went  i loved it as much as he did
Oct 31 2022,positive,i was pleasantly surprised by this movie after seeing spiderman i was worried super hero movies were all heading in the wrong direction i enjoyed this and so did the other 4 in our group
Oct 31 2022,positive,black adam was excellent my favorite aspect was how well integrated all the side superheroes were to the movie they neither stole adams spotlight nor were underwhelming the plot was perfect for an antihero such as black adam as well my main knock against the movie was the occasional light humor that i felt took away from the movies darker tone adam set in the beginning
Oct 31 2022,positive,this was a ton of fun i have no idea why the critics gave this a low score story was fun characters were explained and developed as much as i would expect it set up a future to learn more isnt that what its supposed to do the action was nonstop and we had a great time watching this in imax hoping dc can carry this momentum and fun into future projects excited for the future
Oct 31 2022,positive,i went into this movie with low expectations of superhero movies as of late especially with marvel pumping out mediocre films but i can honestly say i enjoyed this one a lot of cgi obviously but not a bad story line dwayne johnson played the character well and did a decent job as director
Oct 31 2022,positive,action great storyline
Oct 31 2022,positive,its not the rock its black adam no self expositions no hi i am bs enjoyable fun and electrifying pun intended and it has jokes too but does not distract you from the thought or intent of the scenes watched it with the wife and we enjoyed it
Oct 31 2022,positive,edge of your seat action at every turn best acting by rock in any of his other movies this is likely the top 3 dc movies to date
Oct 31 2022,positive,disliked all thus sound you can feel what the action
Oct 31 2022,positive,it had a few funny moments tons of action black adam had multiple abilitiessuperpowers a few teary moments very entertaining the whole time the only down side was actually the justice society were annoying for most of the movie lol
Oct 31 2022,positive,excelent very entertaining wonderful from beginning to end it is spectacular good effects  dwayne johnson and pierce brosnan great job
Oct 30 2022,positive,great story line action packed and very entertaining  love dwayne johnson he rarely disappoints  looking forward to the sequel
Oct 30 2022,positive,black adam rocks  the cast is perfect especially the rock and pierce brosnan  see it on the biggest screen possible 
Oct 30 2022,positive,amazing everything id expect from a dwayne johnson movie along with the quality of my friends who were part of the production 
Oct 30 2022,positive,really good movie all round
Oct 30 2022,positive,strong story with lots of action well done
Oct 30 2022,positive,a great super hero movie this is not perfect but is better than the recent super heroes movies
Oct 30 2022,positive,i loved it  then again  i love everything the rock does
Oct 30 2022,positive,dc has needed a new character and movie to interest audiences  they finally are on to something  a little disappointing that they will be brining superman into the next one  black adam can certainly stand on his own for a couple of movies without the former dc supporting cast
Oct 30 2022,positive,the movie was great plenty of action from beginning to end but i didnt like the fact that after being buried for 5000 he wakes up and he speaks perfect english 
Oct 30 2022,positive,critics are too critical of the rock i thinkits great a movie
Oct 30 2022,positive,i enjoyed the hell out of this movie  they dialed the camp to a minimum compared to shazam or even aquaman  they leaned into the antihero aspect of the character and managed to keep blood to minimum but it is still very violent  it really is just a straightup action flick some character development but nothing significant in that area  so if you really just want an enjoyable action flick then this is for you
Oct 30 2022,negative,i was not prepared for just how relentlessly dumb this movie was going to be cliche and cheese turned up to the max acting and storyline was more hilarious than any of the jokes were able to land it was like being stuck on a roller coaster for way too long all that being said if youre into action for actions sake then this hits the nail on the head
Oct 30 2022,positive,it was long and kinda boring
Oct 30 2022,positive,great film dwayne johnson was perfect for the role tons of action great story and exciting post credit scene
Oct 30 2022,positive,i found it entertaining but i just didnt know enough of the history of bblack adamshazam  and the other characters to really get into it
Oct 30 2022,positive,absolutely loved every minute of it
Oct 30 2022,positive,a great addition to the dceu
Oct 30 2022,positive,the movie was in deed fun but need so work for black adam 2 going to see it once more this week
Oct 30 2022,neutral,it seemed to move slowly in the story line  the fight scenes seemed too long and involved the special effects were great
Oct 30 2022,positive,no nonsense top action dc movie u are in for a treat
Oct 30 2022,positive,black adam was amazing this movie was action packed fun and hilarious the entire cinema was in fits ow simultaneous laughter the storyline was immaculate if anyone says otherwise they are lying ill definitely be watching again if you havent seen it you should
Oct 30 2022,positive,a lot of copy paste from marvel movies and plots but all in all a great experience and  luckily  a little bloody was worried its pg 13 but glad it was not
Oct 30 2022,positive,perfect movie idk why anyone wouldnt enjoy it also it does have a post credit scene
Oct 30 2022,negative,they should have taken some of the enormous amounts of money they must have spent on computer generated special effects and  redirected those funds to have hired better writers who would have known how to craft a more cogent story line
Oct 30 2022,neutral,it was okay the fight scenes were fun and the justice society of america was the only outstanding parts of the movie thats why i think that it doesnt feel like a black adam movie more like a justice society movie the rock is mediocore at best in this
Oct 30 2022,positive,very entertaining film
Oct 30 2022,positive,glad to see finally get a movie right my favorite dc movie since wonder woman i would definitely recommend you see it for yourself
Oct 30 2022,positive,really good movie  not the outcome i was expecting which made it that much better
Oct 30 2022,positive,amazing movie no words can describe
Oct 30 2022,positive,wow so much fun i smiled at so many parts and hawk man was great drfate was great black adam was amazing badass stop what you are doing and go have some fun and see this movie 
Oct 30 2022,positive,movie was entertaining for the most part however this is just another rock movie story not that great rocks performance is the same in every movie his dialogue is so bad too like his tone in his voice is the same throughout the whole movie kid actor pretty bad and a lot of the jokes were not hitting at least give him the black adam widows peak and pointy ears instead of just making him look like the rock not the worst dc movie but i dont think im gonna watch this again lol
Oct 30 2022,positive,amazing super hero movie action fantasy fun but not a stupid comedy
Oct 30 2022,positive,it was ok in my opinion but it was awesome
Oct 30 2022,positive,little too long but we enjoyed it a bunch
Oct 30 2022,positive,good background story of black adam and great lineup of characters this movie opened up the possibilities of new dc movies to branch off into and continue kids loved it
Oct 30 2022,positive,i like the movie very much
Oct 30 2022,positive,put a smile on my face watching this movie it will be fun to see whereif the story might go from there the rock was born for the role
Oct 30 2022,positive,dcs best blockbuster title to date
Oct 30 2022,positive,black adam cause xplosions and awesome deaths and laughs and old school cheesy dialogue and raw entertainment on the big screen and generic storytelling absolutely enjoyed myself   7510
Oct 30 2022,positive,dwayne johnson did an amazing job portraying black adam the director missed the mark though lots of corny scenes and the storyline needed more depth
Oct 30 2022,positive,shazam is a good popcorn movie it wont blow your mind or give you a new deep philosophical meaning to the world or yourself but it is enjoyable and entertaining which is all i want in a movie
Oct 30 2022,positive,this movie is amazing funny action perfect popcorn movie
Oct 30 2022,positive,it was ok great action but again the story was weak the charters were not developed
Oct 30 2022,negative,story line confusing  the rocks usual humor and intensity was not there  tedious man posturing between main characters was silly and added nothing to story  special effects were not special
Oct 30 2022,positive,absolutely fantastic the action scenes were done very well and had me wanting more i especially loved the scene where black adam declared that it was black adamin time and proceeded to black adam all over the room
Oct 30 2022,negative,it had a few great moments but ultimately it falls flat weak script and story multiple bad characters as far as acting and a few characters are absolutely unnecessary to the film there are so many plot holes and consistency issues within this one movie its entertaining enough but its not a good film
Oct 30 2022,positive,it was really good dwayne johnson did an amazing job he made this movie
Oct 30 2022,positive,overall i enjoyed it lots of new characters though without backstory not as good as marvel d johnson was really good and his character was great to watch cgi of the villain was a little lacking
Oct 30 2022,positive,no back story till over 12 way thru the movie it was okbut im not a comic book reader so the characters were a mystery to me
Oct 30 2022,positive,it was a very good movie
Oct 30 2022,positive,i was pleasantly surprised with this movie i really enjoyed it
Oct 30 2022,positive,this movie was all around great the cgi is ages ahead of anything we have seen the story was well done with a great twist enjoyed 100

Oct 30 2022,positive,it is exactly what it an action superhero movie dont go in expecting the godfather and you will not be disappointed
Oct 30 2022,positive,action packed and just a really good hero movie still confused as to why it was rated so badly by rt see it for yourself and enjoy the ride
Oct 30 2022,positive,such a fun film could have some improvements
Oct 30 2022,positive,loved the story loved dwayne johnson
Oct 30 2022,positive,its a nice film with action drama and one fantástic moral message
Oct 30 2022,positive,there are points where it seems formulaic in the beginning and where some of the heavier moments dont quite land but the cast the cast was what made it very very entertaining to watch led by pierce brosnan the man has still got it and the rock who plays a hilariously dry humored anti hero along with everyone who does a great role in keeping the movie interesting    you can tell a lot of care went into playing the characters right and that kind of effort should be rewarded especially when the result is a very damn entertaining movie
Oct 30 2022,positive,the story was amazingly writen and well paced in my opinion i was afraid of how the dwayne the rock johnson was gonna perform since he doesnt do much dramatic more serious roles but i loved it wasnt super comical but whenever there was a funny scene or interaction it was hilarious
Oct 30 2022,positive,i love a good action movie and this was it
Oct 30 2022,negative,worst movie i saw this year i walked out and ive never done that at a movie 
Oct 30 2022,positive,it was a great movie the whole cast did an amazing job
Oct 30 2022,positive,great fun at the movies action packed popcorn movie will be purchasing the 4k blu ray when it releases that mid credit scene too wow 
Oct 30 2022,positive,good story and fighting

Oct 30 2022,positive,the best dc movie i have seen in years the rock didnt disappoint and the movie moves along well with loads of action and fun
Oct 30 2022,positive,loved the movie going to rewatch it
Oct 30 2022,positive,pretty good basic story and performances from everybody no nonsense
Oct 30 2022,positive,great special effects  good humor  and the rock  what more can i say
Oct 30 2022,positive,too slow towards the end
Oct 30 2022,neutral,aldis hodge sarah shahi and the and i heavily use air quotes here supporting cast were the highlight of this movie overall its what i would have expected of a dc movie with this particular cast and i used my movie pass to watch it  but i was glad that i went during the day and had seating next to and in front of me to stretch out i would have loved for siblings and parentskids to speak to each other in their native tongue but it wasnt awful
Oct 30 2022,positive,this movie played like a comic book if you like a big screen comic book this was awesome great action if you want more realistic see a marvel movie i really liked it for what it was
Oct 30 2022,positive,a bit more serious for dwayne johnson but overall still a great watch nice little cameo at the end of the film as well
Oct 30 2022,positive,the last act appeared kind of nowhere but aside from that movie was great good cgi great action scenes amazing acting and a story that felt somewhat fresh to me i highly recommend watching it
Oct 30 2022,neutral,the only good things of this movie are drfate and the post credit scene
Oct 30 2022,positive,fun funny lots of action
Oct 30 2022,positive,enjoyed the movie keep your attention
Oct 30 2022,negative,how can anyone like this utter rubbish
Oct 30 2022,positive,must watch  better then thor and eternals
Oct 30 2022,neutral,i expected it to be nothing but a fun popcorn flick and to an extent it was action was awesome theres lots of it and most of the cast were great in their roles unfortunately the writing is so atrocious that when the rock or jsa wernt smashing things i was angrily rolling my eyes
Oct 30 2022,positive,an absolutely thrilling experience that brings to life a much maligned comic book character  the rock and the writers in general showed their love for these characters and for the dc universe in general  there were some wooden moments to be sure but that will come with most movies and the key characters were all flawless and enjoyable
Oct 30 2022,positive,the movie was amazing it was jam packed with action and great story telling  the acting was amazing and it was perfectly cast
Oct 30 2022,positive,if any movie needs to be watched in a theater this is one of them action packed from beginning to end and the special effects were incredible
Oct 30 2022,positive,is not a masterpiece there are some facilitations of the script the villain is not good but it fulfills its role being a superhero movie with amazing special effects incredible action scenes and the characters are pretty good too the atom smasher and cyclone are forgettable in conclusion this movie is perfect for fans
Oct 30 2022,positive,the movie is far from perfect but it has solid cgi glorious fight scenes and an understandable plot  the problem i saw somethimes is the tone changing abruptly but its super watchable enjoyable and inofensive
Oct 30 2022,positive,i like the movie it was awesome and i hope they make a new one
Oct 30 2022,positive,loved the story line and the special effects
Oct 30 2022,positive,just a sunday movie waiting for the movie is goin to safe dc universe superman
Oct 30 2022,positive,i always judge films on whether i would watch again unfortunately this is not one of them maybe follow up may be a bit better
Oct 30 2022,positive,amazing the movie if its good the fight scenes are perfect the script i didnt like it very much but its worth going to the cinema to have fun
Oct 30 2022,positive,solid and 1010 a milestone of something exciting coming
Oct 30 2022,positive,its just a good film i recommend it
Oct 30 2022,positive,action packed movie the rock as black adam is a badass
Oct 30 2022,positive,went with my son who was all excited about the booms the action and of course dwayne johnson  for my part i was quite surprised to find actual self awareness in an american super hero movie that is taking place in a middle eastern country with ancient history being terrorized and robbed of resources by a rogue mercenary force the intergang  it could not have been clearer iraq or syria were meant in desperate need of a hero of their own culture to free them from the neocon intergang  i have to deduct half a star for the messed up finale though where the choices of the protagonists barely made any sense and too much was stuffed in like too many spices
Oct 30 2022,positive,it was a great movie with a great story
Oct 30 2022,negative,it sucked story wasnt interesting and all together it was just a mess
Oct 30 2022,negative,wasnt for me end credits worth sticking around for
Oct 30 2022,positive,great movie this was a very fun way to spend 2 hours of my life wayne johnson owns this role completely the setting and backstory are interesting stellar action  humor i laughed a lot is it perfect of course not but the critics slamming on this show are completely outoftouch with normal people dont miss the postcredit scene

Oct 30 2022,positive,entertaining with lots of action worth the ticket will be interesting to see how he extends into the rest of the dc universe of movie after this
Oct 30 2022,positive,this movie was nonstop action from beginning to end
Oct 30 2022,negative,this might have been the worst dc movie i have watched the action is okay saves from the bad acting and wonky cgi i cant even see them building something on top of this story
Oct 30 2022,negative,ridiculous poorly written and a very unsettling origin story

Oct 30 2022,positive,the movie was interesting at times elongated to get to specifics in getting to the point of the story
Oct 30 2022,positive,good story with plenty of action and excellent special effects
Oct 30 2022,positive,i loved  i never seem to agree with the critics  great fun film with lots of action   its the type of movie i was expecting and thats what i got

Oct 30 2022,positive,everything that you want out of a superhero movie
Oct 30 2022,positive,enjoyable movie actions were so good 
Oct 30 2022,negative,lousy cheesy and predictable story terrible acting specially by the rock one of the worst movies of the year

Oct 30 2022,positive,one of the greatest cinematic experience ever
Oct 30 2022,positive,the movie was great even when people say it follows the same superhero movie story dosent mean it wasnt a great movie 810 for sure
Oct 30 2022,positive,good movie fun for everyone
Oct 30 2022,positive,it was a great addition to the dc universe powerful storyline and great cast only thing i disliked is that it felt like a stand alone film
Oct 30 2022,positive,zero idea how anyone under rotten potatoes could have given this a bad rating 
Oct 30 2022,positive,not boring funny jokes normal acting
Oct 30 2022,positive,great movie there wasnt a dull moment in the movie were it dragged always kept you on your edge of your seat but im little confused on this movie maybe down the road it will explain it more on as to how we have now have two shazam
Oct 30 2022,positive,love the introduction at the end the movie itself was very good they held on somewhat to the story line cant wait for the next one
Oct 30 2022,positive,excellent movie from start to finish

Oct 30 2022,positive,the pecial effects were good
Oct 30 2022,negative,terrible movie waste of my time and money i was hoping for something different especially with the hype portrayed commercially in my opinion it was the same old origin story you could see in any other comic film except this one didnt hold up nor keep my attention
Oct 30 2022,positive,action packed after credit scene brought me life
Oct 30 2022,positive,entertaining with basically non stop action typical dc movie where many characters are introduced with zero back story  hard to care much about them when you know nothing about them
Oct 30 2022,positive,great movie a must see tons of action
Oct 30 2022,positive,much better than anticipated a lot of action some drama and some humor nice mix
Oct 30 2022,negative,uhg im not trying to be critical but this movie is not for everyone its boring at most and cringe sometimes watching this later free on tv somewhere would be better not worth the money and risk going to the theater  
Oct 30 2022,positive,one of the best superhero movie of all time
Oct 30 2022,positive,was a bit cheesy during first half but was still overall fun time got better as it went
Oct 30 2022,positive,just watched the movie today its extremely good amazing cast and plot cannot wait to watch it again
Oct 30 2022,positive,instead of adam call him jahmaal
Oct 30 2022,positive,this movie is pure action fun dwayne johnsons performance was great the critics are taking the movie way too seriously  and i just wouldnt trust the people who gave shehulk a good review
Oct 30 2022,positive,a typical superhero movie dwayne johnson is just super as always to hell with the opinions of critics you just need to relax watch the movie and decide for yourself
Oct 30 2022,positive,great film ignore the critics and go watch it was great in 4dx
Oct 30 2022,positive,the best superhero movie ive seen in recent times fight power destruction and comedy in the right measure
Oct 30 2022,positive,i loved it very good film just what dc needed right now go see it yourself ignore the haters
Oct 30 2022,neutral,good action and solid acting but it is another movie solely relying on cgi and green screens
Oct 30 2022,positive,dc is doing a great job introducing new characters with pretty solid storytelling
Oct 30 2022,negative,poor  goofy writing packed scenes that make parts of the film hard to follow awful acting at times and weird plot points are what let this movie down for me i was really hoping this would be a good dc film but it really let me down and im losing hope in dc hopefully james gunn can save it
Oct 30 2022,positive,the movie was great and very entertaining me and my fiancée enjoyed it very much 
Oct 30 2022,positive,me and my sister really enjoyed it
Oct 30 2022,positive,dont listen to the nerds and their negative reviews most of them dont follow dc and they just throwin their 2 cents
Oct 30 2022,positive,the critics dont always get it right the audience wanted an actionbased antihero movie and thats exactly what the rock delivered not everything is an arthouse piece nor should it be
Oct 30 2022,positive,movie was amazing great action and amazing new characters added to dc universe 
Oct 30 2022,positive,great origin story for a side character in the dc universe keep the movies coming now dc
Oct 30 2022,positive,ive been waiting for this movie since the rock said hed make it happen years ago after seeing it it did not disappoint he was born to play black adam and embodied the character in a way no one else could the action was awesome effects fantastic and humor well placed with great timing and dont get me started on the after credits scene  i cant wait to go see it again and purchase it the day it come out
Oct 30 2022,positive,the script was all over the place but a fun movie
Oct 30 2022,positive,good asss movie  it was awesome 
Oct 30 2022,positive,its very good love how different a hero black adam is action is great also really like all the cast choices for the other heroes
Oct 30 2022,positive,the rock plays the rock in this movie  this movie has the thinnest of plots but some great action scenes i found myself bored and just waiting for the next fight scene  its just on
Oct 30 2022,positive,good movie overall couldve been better
Oct 30 2022,positive,the action was great and black adams ruthlessness was captured perfectly
Oct 30 2022,positive,though nowhere near as gamechanging as i think its marketing would lead you to believe black adam does find dwayne johnson and his jungle cruise collaborator jaume colletserra subverting a few of the usual superhero subgenre trappings here and there the most notable of these is of course the degree of antiheroism displayed by the titular character make no mistake no huge lines are crossed here but the wrathfulness is undeniably fun to watch nonetheless this thing moves quite briskly as well  sometimes to its own detriment with that though i can say i was never bored while watching this theres always something going on a lot of which works other things dont a few of the side characters are a bit grating a portion of the humor doesnt land effects waver in quality on occasion johnson brosnan and hodge are quite good though in the end id say black adam is perfectly decent  and admittedly dumb  fun
Oct 30 2022,positive,the best movie ever i loved the jsa and i cant wait for part 2
Oct 30 2022,positive,amazing movie with great pacing an appropriate amount of comedy and a lot of action
Oct 30 2022,positive,this movie was a blast to watch it manages to keep you at the edge of your seat always that special cameo at the end was everything one could have asked for
Oct 30 2022,positive,actionpacked super backtobasics superhero movie since they modified his backstory hes less villainous than his comic counterpart and appears more like an antihero    the digital effects are great but it takes away from the rocks usual brand of action its not bad but blurs the action away also the usual charm that he brings in all his movies is completely gone which is sad because its another reason i like watching his movies    it does mean a lot of the supporting cast and their personalities shine really well perhaps it was done on purpose the story is mostly good the main villian was soso but in the end it was a great movie and still worth watching
Oct 30 2022,positive,it lived you to the hype its a must see
Oct 30 2022,positive,other than just being pretty fast paced it was actually a really good movie
Oct 30 2022,positive,much better than expected the shazam world has the right idea action packed movies with humor plus we finally have someone who can take in superman and the rock was great in this 
Oct 30 2022,negative,not funny  very boring  terrible story line and i do like the rocks movies but this 1 stunk
Oct 30 2022,positive,if you like superhero movies this is a must see i hope theres a sequel in the works
Oct 30 2022,negative,the action is so loud and monotonous you long for a break but when it comes  its so dull you go get another ice cream
Oct 30 2022,positive,great movie critics were wrong as always
Oct 30 2022,positive,full of action good story
Oct 30 2022,positive,i liked it the kids liked it good job blending the dc universe together
Oct 30 2022,positive,it was a really fun and action packed movie it also had really good cgi bring on the new wave of superhero movies
Oct 30 2022,positive,black adam isnt the best dceu movie but after watching it i think dwayne made dc take one step and goddamn pierce bronson is amazing as doctor fate and i wanted to see more about the justice society    my point is that even the critics dont say the same black adam helped dc to know what fans really want       understand warner
Oct 30 2022,positive,we loved the action and humor also loved that it was kid friendly
Oct 30 2022,positive,i loved the movie dr fate is the character that i liked the most on the contrary the woman and her son are the weakest it has its flaws but its the best ive seen from dc and also from marvel this year
Oct 30 2022,positive,this movie is entertaining the movie critiques are trying their hardest to bring it down but it does well what its supposed to being an action packed spectacle
Oct 30 2022,negative,i dont believe the audience loved this movie rottontomatoes switched the scores 90tomatoes  40audience this movie sucked even both boys thought so11 and 7 hated it
Oct 30 2022,positive,the rock absolutely killed it as black adam it is a step in the right direction for the dc universe i cant wait for the next appearance of black adam and a certain someone shown in the end credits
Oct 30 2022,positive,was it the best super hero movie no was it awesome hell yeah it is an introduction to what should be the evolution of the dceu its was a rollercoaster of good and bad writing and lack of character development dceu has a chance to come out strong with future projects with this foundation there is so much potential im excited to see whats next for the dceu
Oct 30 2022,positive,this movie was awesome im not super into dc so i cant tell you how how this movie was to the comics but i loved it
Oct 30 2022,positive,loved the movie love the rock plenty of action definitely give it two thumbs up
Oct 30 2022,positive,this movie is awesome some scenes dragged on too long but overall it was great
Oct 30 2022,positive,i love it finally dc thank you great special effects
Oct 30 2022,positive,the critics did a horrible job at reviewing this film the story was great pierce bronsans job on dr fate was phenomenal the story was great and the characters were awesome aswell good dialogue and understanding of the film aswell also henry cavill is back as superman lets goo
Oct 30 2022,positive,a good movie that should have been better given all the positive elements working in its favor the visuals are solid and the acting is fine for the most part where this really feels underwhelming is in the many plot holes that really shouldnt have been that difficult to fill given the amount of time spent developing this film i have no idea why this was so poorly written in places all that said this is still an enjoyable movie that is well worth watching
Oct 30 2022,positive,fun full of action  charaters where more real and i look forward to the next chapter
Oct 30 2022,neutral,this was a strange movie based on the critics reviews i had not planned on seeing it however as the audience rating increased and a dearth of movies worth seeing in october i decided to invest in watching it  the storyline was somewhat decent enough but not well explained and the chronology throughout was a mishmash  the script the acting the cinematography and the editing were all secondrate at best   if you are bored because there are have not been enough decent movies in the autumn of 2022 then go see it but do not go with any expectations of a joker or batman depth and certainly not a marvel calibre but go because you want to be in a theatre postcovid
Oct 30 2022,positive,the rock really turned dc around 
Oct 30 2022,positive,an absolute visual treat loved it
Oct 30 2022,positive,good character development and lots of action
Oct 30 2022,positive,noise and flash take away from the characterizations and story  for children not adults  actually the noise and flash are not good for children
Oct 30 2022,positive,love the action scenes the slow motion more in detail action scenes in particular
Oct 30 2022,positive,action packed great story worth the ticket
Oct 30 2022,positive,such a great movie even my daughter liked it and she dont like superhero movies
Oct 30 2022,positive,was a fun thrill ride from start to finish im excited to see where dc goes now with this laughs were peppered nicely through the film and didnt feel forced wanna see a number 2
Oct 30 2022,negative,unfortunately i cant give a rating because just as the movie was about to start the theater caught on fire what are the odds of that happening luckily no one was hurt or injured
Oct 30 2022,positive,overall it was entertaining it was refreshing to see dc make a comeback with marvel on the decline henrycavilismysuperman
Oct 30 2022,positive,very good great graphics
Oct 30 2022,negative,poor acting stupid premises long drawn discussions this is the dumbest superhero movie ever dr fate trying to do dr strangenot not sure if they borrowed the the x mens blackbird as well as prof xaviers mansion and since when did hawkman ever have super strength to stand toe to toe with black adam
Oct 30 2022,positive,great action and the rock was made for this character
Oct 30 2022,positive,fun and original with a darker approach so its refreshing from classic hero movies but i am not so fond of major roles being given to kids that dont have experience with acting so im giving 4 out of 5 stars
Oct 30 2022,positive,the movie is outstanding 10010
Oct 30 2022,positive,absolute blast what we need right now
Oct 30 2022,positive,black adam was such an amazing experience if your a dc fan you got to watch it
Oct 30 2022,positive,great action throughout the movie great evening with my grandkids
Oct 30 2022,positive,that shoot was amazing man
Oct 30 2022,positive,can you smeeeeeeeeellllllllwhat the kid credits scene is cooking
Oct 30 2022,negative,it was very typical of the genre    but it just seemed like an excuse to highlight dwayne it didnt succeed
Oct 30 2022,positive,was awesome my and the family loved it
Oct 30 2022,positive,what the superheroes fans always want is a fan service movie here we have that at a 90 i think the more purist maybe wont like the origins and motivations of the characters but overall it will meet a lots of the expectations
Oct 30 2022,positive,10 yrs ago i wouldve loved this movie the dialogue was kind of cheesy action was great and pacing was okay dc continues to throw in new characters without any space to develop their stories to build connection to the audience still was quite a watchable movie
Oct 30 2022,positive,my family and i loved the movie great job dc
Oct 30 2022,positive,really like the rock in this role move had a lot of action and liked the story line a lot
Oct 30 2022,negative,this movie was not worth seeing in the theater predictable i would not recommend we walked out halfway through
Oct 30 2022,positive,excellent visuals brilliant johnson character he was born for this the storys good action set pieces are bit bayesque and humorous which is nice rather than being too bleak deffo needs a trilogy recommended for fun heartwarming ride tell them the man in black sent you still laughing
Oct 30 2022,positive,it was okay just a little too long
Oct 30 2022,positive,great movie great picture cant wait for the next one
Oct 30 2022,positive,didnt like how they kept trying to make adam a hero and how the origin story changed shazam is his rival not superman but it was a nice story i liked it
Oct 30 2022,negative,my god worst superhero movie that i have seen in forever is negative possible on ratings and would like my money back if possible
Oct 30 2022,negative,super predictable corny and drawn out
Oct 30 2022,positive,enjoyed the film one of the better dc shows
Oct 30 2022,positive,great movie one of he best dcu movies to date 
Oct 30 2022,positive,i enjoyed the movie lots of action and special effects the rock was great
Oct 30 2022,positive,okay way better than i expected i would definitely recommend
Oct 30 2022,positive,this movie was the definition of ok definitely not accurate to the comics but the cgi was solid the acting was good some characters annoyed the hell out of me
Oct 30 2022,positive,dc brought their a game with one
Oct 30 2022,positive,wry action packed with a little mixed in comedy
Oct 30 2022,positive,it was funny and action pack
Oct 30 2022,negative,  the expert movie reviewers are correct  the story was creative but the execution of the script was very poor  it wasnt funny nor understandable more than half the time  the superimposed face of the rock on his doubles body was a ripoff  in fact i dont think the rock showed his real body at all and thats all i wanted to see
Oct 30 2022,positive,great movie n a couple of laughs
Oct 30 2022,positive,very good movie action packed
Oct 30 2022,positive,if you love comics see this movie this was a another really good comic book movie by dc sold acting a good storyline action amazing visual effects this has everything simplistic that most of us look for when it comes to the comic book stories that made the genre what it is today my mother even loved it and she has no idea who this character even is lol
Oct 30 2022,positive,a great movie especialy trama for me is so good
Oct 30 2022,positive,the action and end scene were amazing
Oct 30 2022,positive,the effects and graphics
Oct 30 2022,positive,lots of action enjoyed the movie maybe a little to long for me
Oct 30 2022,positive,tons of action    the story lacked a bit of depth but the hero line up action and the rock as black adam made it all worth it
Oct 30 2022,positive,action packed as you would expect from a rocks movie amazing effects impecable costume design predictable story with a couple of interesting twists badass villain but lacking personality all in all dont expect an oscar drama story is a flashy superhero movie with a lot of slow mo and fireworks totally in tone with the dc universe and that also opens the door for very cool stuff to come
Oct 30 2022,positive,great action and humor
Oct 30 2022,positive,i grew up reading comics in the 80s and as a kid i love the end of the world scenario recent hero movies tries to be too smart or too funny which in the end leads to a boring film this movie went back to basic a little humour story great characters and most important action pack rollercoster ride and its fantastic
Oct 30 2022,positive,this is a perfectly fine superhero movie there is no agenda there is no woke political messaging and that is why the critics are trashing it it is not the greatest movie ive ever seen but is a perfectly fun way to spend a couple of hours watching superheroes beat each other up watch really good cgi and see a fun movie something which has been sorely lacking lately in films for those of us who are not woke i think it is very important we go support this
Oct 30 2022,negative,its like a 1000 mini action clips stitched together eventually it becomes boring to watch
Oct 30 2022,positive,great action good story i think they could have let the rock have a few more comedic lines
Oct 30 2022,positive,the movie was great action packed and no woke bs marvel could learn a lot from this movie
Oct 30 2022,positive,i loved the beginning the middle and the ending nothing but action
Oct 30 2022,positive,a lot of science and truth about history and about how theirs is no such thing as wrong or right   because all correct comes the all  allah

Oct 30 2022,positive,very fun and entertaining i absolutely loved it
Oct 30 2022,positive,it was great to see dc making enjoyable movies again  but when did hawkman get so powerful  dr fate was a real joyand that stinger at the end of the movie  keep it up dc

Oct 30 2022,positive,just plain fun cant wait to see more of these characters

Oct 30 2022,positive,just a fun movie to watch sets up other good potential movies i couldnt make a movie any better not to judgemental i would go see it again
Oct 30 2022,negative,special effects were top notch the actors did what they could with it pierce brosnan was really good some of the jokes were good lighting was good thats about it that was good so if you love special effects this is a great movie really if you care about story plot logic directing or writing then maybe just skip this one
Oct 30 2022,positive,non stop action a different take on a hero great movie
Oct 30 2022,neutral,a lot of action a lot of slow motion scenes sometimes cringy most of the attempt at comedy fell flat
Oct 30 2022,positive,alot of people compare marvel and dc which is not a good idea because marvel is more like kid or funny its more like the office  series like all jokes dc is more true like batman and joker new ones even this shows how what these heros go through these are widely two different audiences this is a good movie and it deserves the respect it does
Oct 30 2022,positive,the movie was phenomenal  creative special effects and the power endured was overpowering to its opponentsenjoyed it

Oct 30 2022,positive,walked in knowing i was going to like this movie walked out loving it i definitely need to see this movie again definitely need to watch in imax
Oct 30 2022,positive,great comfortable seating les populated probably for the increase cost of ticket the enormous screen and digital processing are incredible one thought perhaps a person running projector can equalize the sound level to gauge different crowd settings to match noise level and comfort
Oct 30 2022,positive,awesome movie by far the best one ive seen all year
Oct 30 2022,positive,dc stepped their game up with black adam the rock was great he a believable superhero and the supporting cast was great to i  would have given a 5 star if the villain would have been better he was not terrible i would have liked to seen more of him but this is definitely one of better dc movies
Oct 30 2022,positive,just a great movie overall
Oct 30 2022,positive,loved it it didnt try to do too much and knew it exactly what it was as a movie the rock was born to play this role black adam sets up an interesting future for the dcu

Oct 30 2022,positive,it was just ok  love watching 2 of my favorite actors dwayne johnson and pierce brosnan  but it was more childish and repetitive than i expected  it kept me entertained
Oct 30 2022,positive,it was okay the movie could have removed the two kid heroes and nothing would have been lost the atom kid was actually pretty annoying fight scenes were good story was okay i would not pay to watch it again but i would watch it again
Oct 30 2022,positive,fantastic movie i really enjoyed this with my kids and am already waiting for the sequel the rock may always be the rock in his movies but the rock made a perfect black adam and the film was 100mph from start to finish wouldnt hesitate to see multiple times experience it in theaters
Oct 30 2022,positive,very enjoyable action packed and no agenda being pushed just a good comic book movie
Oct 30 2022,positive,awesome movie i dont know whats in critics minds but this movie is worth getting over 85 ratings
Oct 30 2022,positive,good movie just the inclusion of the devil type villain wasnt all that pleasing
Oct 30 2022,positive,overall was goodwish zack snyder did the movie  to much of young kid in the moviegood action    loved superman return of henry 
Oct 30 2022,positive,the rock has delivered the goods the new dc hq has hit pay dirt with the new direction of dc movie making the adults are back in charge
Oct 30 2022,positive,it was awsome it was great movie of all time
Oct 30 2022,positive,40 by the critics  another payday from marvel eh  this movie was a solid 4 stars  fast paced action packed cool characters and good foundation of a storyline  these so called critics are all paid off by disney sad   at the same time they would rate these cooker cutter marvel movies 90  never trust the critics
Oct 30 2022,neutral,this movie is not great sorry to say the pacing is way off and there are some big plot holes and the plot could be a bit more polished but i like a couple of the characters and the action was fine so i guess this movie is ok 510
Oct 30 2022,positive,this is the redemption arc for the dceu
Oct 30 2022,positive,good movie and excited to see superman versus black adam
Oct 30 2022,positive,great story and twist and great ending in my opinion
Oct 30 2022,positive,great action movie it was made for the rock
Oct 30 2022,positive,amazing casting and lots of character depth that made the story not feel rushed but well done
Oct 30 2022,positive,great effects slow story line but great overall
Oct 30 2022,positive,black adam is awesome honestly the best superhero movie ive seen since spider man no way home and avengers endgame
Oct 30 2022,positive,its a great movie but definitive kind of boring with great special effects but not interesting story to tell take another way to show us this characters i another way but i thought it would be different but i totally recommended to burn some time and make it funny
Oct 30 2022,positive,dwayne johnson is in his element and does not disappoint i laughed and laughed and laughed  my favorite since iron man
Oct 30 2022,positive,loved it a must see the rock was great
Oct 29 2022,negative,this was a very boring movie i actually fell asleep
Oct 29 2022,positive,lots of action and very enjoyable
Oct 29 2022,positive,a lot going on in the story line a bit to follow  but overall a lot of crash boom bang and sometimes thats all you need
Oct 29 2022,positive,great action pack superhero movie
Oct 29 2022,positive,first ignore the critics they are clueless as usual i love the movie i have seen it twice the movie has a good story is well thoughtout and with a nice flow there is plenty of hardcore action dwayne looks good kicking ass this movie has plenty of really good fights that are done really well the cgi in the movie is really well done i loved the characters doctor fate and hawkman and i thought that black adam was excellent this is not a perfect movie but for a superhero movie it comes pretty dang close
Oct 29 2022,positive,it was great loved all the action and killing
Oct 29 2022,positive,dunno what critics expected but the movie was everything you could ask from a superhero movie    a good origin story a good mix of supporting superheroes and a great tiein with the rest of the dc universe    nonone dimensional black adam too he develops over the movie
Oct 29 2022,positive,loved this movie the rock was great i couldnt think of a better black adam a little more character development wouldve been nice
Oct 29 2022,positive,the movie is by the standards that dcwarner had accustomed us a breath of fresh air in terms of superhero movies  i can say without problem that the film starts quite well it raises many things that will be relevant to the end from the beginning except for a couple of details that perhaps could have been better explained   the second act is definitely the best in the film you can see the effort they put into the special effects and the scenarios qandak definitely feels alive with people reacting to the things justice society and black adam himself do although i think there may have been more onscreen extras at times which only sam raimi in spiderman could do  for the end i think it is satisfying you feel the tension in the tense moments you even manage to empathize with characters who had been very rough during the first two acts but i think this is where my biggest problem with the film is  im not quite sure how doctor fates helmet is supposed to work maybe i havent read the comics enough but as far as i knew i thought you had to put on the helmet to have the powers maybe its just something i think they could have explained better but other than that as i said the ending is satisfying    by the way the postcredits scene is definitely otherworldly i was unlucky enough to get a spoiler on tiktok before going to see the movie but when i saw her i literally fell on my ass on the floor in short it is worth seeing i do not know what else they expect to go see it at their nearest cinema
Oct 29 2022,positive,no time to blink no time to get bored no time to think the movie is a perfect mix of action dark humour and an awesome cast
Oct 29 2022,positive,amazing movie best movie ive seen in a long time i went and saw it twice i night go see a third time black adam is my new favorite hero yes hes an hero in my books
Oct 29 2022,positive,great action packed movie with some funny parts
Oct 29 2022,positive,a very excellent movie enjoyed it
Oct 29 2022,negative,it was just an okay movie no real surprises or plot the rock played a version of a character he usually plays i like the rock just wasnt wowed
Oct 29 2022,positive,this was a very good movie that dc has done in a while i didnt compare it to nothing just watch it and enjoy
Oct 29 2022,positive,thought movie was good funny and full of action its a super hero movie
Oct 29 2022,positive,i liked  it was a little repetitive and some of the characters were bland but i took my kids to it and they all loved it and i enjoyed it as well  wasnt coming looking for the godfather
Oct 29 2022,positive,fun set up make sure to wait to mid credits
Oct 29 2022,positive,perfectly funny plenty of good action with the fight scenes having dwayne johnson and henry cavill together even for a few seconds was amazing
Oct 29 2022,positive,very decent movie great action and good graphics it was a fun watch
Oct 29 2022,positive,really exciting and well paced lots of world building and telling a story that spans thousands of years dwayne johnson portrayed a frightening antihero with immense power that really resonated on the big screen
Oct 29 2022,positive,very solid movie needed in the dceu
Oct 29 2022,positive,thoroughly entertaining family movie dwayne johnsons and pierce brosnans performances are just excellent
Oct 29 2022,positive,if you try to take it too seriously it will inevitably fail to impress as a viewing experience its excellent and incredibly entertaining as art its not good because its not trying to be art in the first place the action is visually compelling and well put together   people complain that theres too much action but i think thats not entirely fair the film uses violence as a language as its core to tethadams character to be violent this results in a lot of punchy moments in place of dialogue or as supplements to dialogue that shouldnt really be considered action within the context of the film that being considered it is still a very actionheavy movie but not excessively for an action movie  a lot of people say the plot is confusing or overabundant but it just isnt other than the first 10 minutes the exposition feels natural and spread out well over the course of the film you really dont need the help of any outoftheater explanation to fully understand the plot as long as you pay attention perhaps too much plot to put on in the background as its definitely made for the theater experience and it expects that level of attention
Oct 29 2022,positive,pierce brosnan and dwayne johnson were born to play their characters i just wish that they didnt nerfed dr fate
Oct 29 2022,positive,great visual effects
Oct 29 2022,positive,absolutely loved this movie superb action very clever political undertones re suppression and exploitation of peoples that resonates with a relevant current conflict it was different from other superhero movies decent character depth for black adam however the support characters were very poor dr fate was an interesting character but didnt explore him enough go watch it
Oct 29 2022,positive,excellent plot and loaded with action
Oct 29 2022,positive,this is a great addition to the dceu the story is a bit cliched but comes with a twist very enjoyable and the after credits scene promises a lot
Oct 29 2022,positive,great storyline fight scenes were amazing  mid credit scene was mind blowing
Oct 29 2022,positive,good family entertainment
Oct 29 2022,positive,this was an amazing movie and the story line was great id definitely pay full price again to see this movie
Oct 29 2022,positive,lots of action was good to see more dceu characters be introduced
Oct 29 2022,positive,story was all over the place
Oct 29 2022,positive,i loved fhe action and visuals it was amazing
Oct 29 2022,positive,great movie action from start to finish
Oct 29 2022,positive,i always love movies with the rock so this was expected but it was really really good and enjoyable to watch i cried
Oct 29 2022,positive,this movie was amazing loved the whole cast the rock did an amazing job
Oct 29 2022,positive,absolutely surprised me how well this movie was made checks off all the boxes for an actionoriginsuperhero movie
Oct 29 2022,positive,very entertaining super hero movie with no agenda to push in my face  so refreshing to be just entertained at a movie lol
Oct 29 2022,negative,terrible in every way plot story acting two hours i wont get back
Oct 29 2022,negative,movie could have been so much better but again dc screwed it up  movie started off pretty decent but just went downhill from there  the only positive thing about this movie was the post credit scene thats it  dont waste your money wait to stream it
Oct 29 2022,positive,the whole movie is packed with action and amazing cgi
Oct 29 2022,positive,what an action movie should be
Oct 29 2022,positive,great movie and cant wait for black adam 2
Oct 29 2022,positive,how come the rottentomatoes critics will rate any marvel garbage like she hulk over 80 but rate black adam 40 thank god for audience rates
Oct 29 2022,positive,great movie lots of action very surprising post credits scene
Oct 29 2022,positive,black adam is an amazing spectacle and viewing it has its ups and downs but when it comes down to it it is a good movie the justice society sold the movie to me pierce brosnan was fantastic as doctor fate and hackman was a conflicted hero who i enjoyed to have onscreen atom smasher was a blatant rip off of a pg deadpool but brought some good laughs either way but the best part was the titular hero dwayne johnson i absoulutely loved and i think dc finally found its feet by making their own humour instead of stealing marvels and to have a cherry on tophenry cavill as superman
Oct 29 2022,positive,honestly pretty good pacing was a bit off and it was hard to connect with any other character except black adam but the action was good and the story made enough sense for a superhero story
Oct 29 2022,positive,an entertaining film from the beginning full of action and impressive sequences recommended to have a good time
Oct 29 2022,positive,great movie everything i wanted it to be
Oct 29 2022,positive,so this should be marketed as pierce brosnan and mo amer featuring rock the  but whatever  what an awesome action packed movie with no woke things or any politics just solid entertainment  oh yeah and black bird person was cool very robotic so fits in the rick and morty timeline
Oct 29 2022,positive,good pacing for the movie i really like it and i really like how they did the story for the character
Oct 29 2022,positive,too much action and killing
Oct 29 2022,positive,action nice story left room for a sequel love that they hit and explained that gray area of heroism some people think they are heroes and doing right when they swoop in the hero is the one who stands up and does what needs to be done
Oct 29 2022,negative,you cant do action just for the sake of action  needs a much more cohesive story  it should take you on a ride  this ride had no direction
Oct 29 2022,positive,far better than i expected  dwayne johnson nailed this performance  it was far more subdued than i anticipated  some great supporting cast members although a few weak ones  i was actually moved by a few of the moments and laughed out loud at others i found the overall film thoroughly entertaining  one of the best superhero movies yet
Oct 29 2022,positive,theres lots of youtube videos that will explain all the new characters if youre not a comic book fan just sayin
Oct 29 2022,positive,loved it the special effects action storyeverything was awesome
Oct 29 2022,positive,absolutely epic i havent been a big dc movies fan but this was great not politically correct 0 woke 100 amazing
Oct 29 2022,positive,i went with my daughter and she really enjoyed it except for spiderman she hasnt really liked the latest tv shows and movies in the superhero genre but this movie got her interested again     black adam is a better than average superhero movie with great characters who carry the show it did have some pacing issues and seemed to drag on at the end which lost it a star but i left excited to see where they take black adam in the future
Oct 29 2022,positive,dc just cant win they tried their best but instead of going after compelling story investment they went for the corny joke amidst amazing special effects and characters that are just too far fetched love the rock but he cant win the all
Oct 29 2022,positive,very entertaining movie nice use of characters  the false finish to get to the end didnt care for nice post credit scenes
Oct 29 2022,positive,loved this project from dc dwayne brings a new but fresh approach to the dceu as a whole and i am loving it i can definitely smell what the rock was cooking in this dc project
Oct 29 2022,positive,worth a watch in the cinema 
Oct 29 2022,positive,amazing hero or anti hero movie black adam is a 1010
Oct 29 2022,positive,black adam has set a new bar for action in superhero movies i went into the cinema without having much expectations owing to the critic ratings id seen earlier but i came out having seen one of the best superhero action movie of all time i dont recall the last time i had so much fun watching a superhero movie it had everything that superman movies needed to have
Oct 29 2022,positive,positives the action is awesome and dwayne johnsons portrayal of black adam is consistent with the comic book character  negatives the musical score is much too moody and intense for most of the film and the storytelling tends to be a bit choppy and disjointed  overall the film doesnt live up to all of its hype but johnson still delivers a solid performance in a mostly fun action romp
Oct 29 2022,positive,this is an action film  if you are looking for plot well thought out puzzle solving to be challenged in your thinking  this may not be the film for you
Oct 29 2022,positive,the movie was entertaining from beginning to end  action action action
Oct 29 2022,positive,ignore the critics and naysayers this is a good movie well worth the price of admission
Oct 29 2022,positive,black adam is kind of me am hoping for when i go to watch any superhero movie it was full of action and the cgi was great all of the characters were awesome the suit of hawkeye helmet of doctor fate and the main villian were some of the other wow factors of the movie go watch it it is a pure fun i was missing this in superhero movies for long time marvel is going unorthodox way with each movie thats not actually working for most of the viewers like me while dc is slowly getting momentum to become fan favorites
Oct 29 2022,positive,has a lot of action
Oct 29 2022,positive,not sure what critics are seeing but black adam was a good movie certainly as good or better than much of what marvel and dc have put out recently
Oct 29 2022,positive,black adam was absolutely mesmerizing dwayne johnson killed it
Oct 29 2022,positive,great action and story highly recommend
Oct 29 2022,positive,the movie was amazing  i have been waiting years for this show and the rock delivered on his promise  nonstop action and black adam kicking some you know what  he gave the fans what they wanted imo  excellent cgi as well  cant wait for the next one
Oct 29 2022,positive,the movie was pretty good lots of action  the signature dwayne the rock johnson charm definitely better than majority of the previous dc movies but they have a long way to go to catch up to disneys marvel universe but its a good step forward the single mid credits scene is definitely worth waiting to watch
Oct 29 2022,positive,i loved everything about the movie it was action pack all the way through
Oct 29 2022,negative,when i got tickets to black adam i had high hopes that it would be a good movie i mean what could be bad about a movie that has dwayne the rock johnson as its lead actor i can tell you that i was deeply disappointed with this movie the writing was a clusterfuck of emotions at one point black adam kills someone in a very brutal way but only a few minutes later the movie tries getting a few cheap laughs out of the viewer with limited success i might say the writing is incoherent and at times confusing the story is hard to follow because the directors tried their best to make the audience laugh even when it didnt feel appropriate when they tried being a movie with a huge budget i of course expected stunning vfx although the vfx artists who worked on this movie did an incredible job it clearly fell apart in the editing process i ask myself if the movie was confusing to me do to the poor writing or the poor dizziness inducing editing that jumps all over the place  the color grading was lacking at best instead of embracing the colorfulness of our earth the movie was plunged in a lightbrown color that made everything seem more washed out and ruined visibility in most scenes    overall i thought that black adam was a movie that fell short on a lot of points and tried making up for the bad writing and editing by casting dwayne the rock johnson in the lead role
Oct 29 2022,positive,awsome movie cant wait for number 2
Oct 29 2022,positive,great movie loved the latest dc characters cant wait for dcs next release
Oct 29 2022,positive,best action movie ive seen in a long time much better than disney marvel very clean and what you would expect from the rock no social agenda hidden behind the script just a really great actionsuperhero film pretty good storyline as well cant wait to see the sequel
Oct 29 2022,positive,a great theatrical experiencedwayne johnson and his action avatar keeps you in awe action sequences are top notchit will be correct to say that this flawed writing and screenplay is saved by action sequences and rocks charisma
Oct 29 2022,positive,refreshing to see a super hero movie that felt real and without fluff  loved the rock as black adam  whole movie was great
Oct 29 2022,positive,loved the movie dont forget to stick around for the scene in the middle of the credits
Oct 29 2022,positive,liked the movie but felt story line was a bit confusing
Oct 29 2022,positive,idk what everyone is bitching about black adam is given an appropriately dark backstory  and it turns out he was a slave had his heroic son murdered in front of him and doesnt feel like being the hero he has a lot of barelycontrolled rage which given that the rock was a heel for years in the wwe is entirely appropriate to both the actor and character    the b team is mostly uselesscomedy relief until the end of the film which along with the teenage kid was kind of annoying the triangle hands symbol would have had way more impact if it had been a secret sign kept hidden out of fear of being arrested instead it seems kind of stupid for them to be doing it    amanda waller is as hateful as ever pretty unbelievable that they try dictating terms to an asyet unstoppable force hawkman was unbelievably arrogant throughout most of the film yet they call him the hero    overall it was pretty good entirely rewatchable and a pretty solid storyline  best effort ive seen in years from dc
Oct 29 2022,positive,way bettter than expected
Oct 29 2022,negative,whilst the action was non stop it lacked any kind of heart behind the story no moral compass for the origins dwayne johnson played a comic book version of himself for the role of black adam and moved mostly by cgi   it is a harmless film to see but dont expect to come out of a screening being more intelligent than when you went in
Oct 29 2022,positive,freaking awesome maaan
Oct 29 2022,positive,the little kid had bad acting and so did his mom  the rock was badass andaba al cien la piedra 
Oct 29 2022,positive,a lot of action and good special effects
Oct 29 2022,positive,wow amazing movie best dc movie 
Oct 29 2022,positive,superhero whos judge jury and exocutioner
Oct 29 2022,negative,didnt get to watch movie there was a fire in theater and we had to evacuated
Oct 29 2022,positive,tldr black adam is a fresh soul in the dc universe with amazing visuals interesting characters and a capturing storyline black adam immerses you in its conflict between godlike beings with their human imperfections    what can i say best movie by far in the dceu or shall i say the dcu  honestly i never read any black adam comics nor knew of him till i watched supermanshazam the return of black adam in 2019 but this movie man it really is something  first things first the plot it takes on the story of the introduction of black adam to the new modern world where his mentality ideas and goals are neither heroic nor optimistic but rather selfish and acts on personal virtue and vendetta that are mostly influenced by the injustice and tyranny his dead son faced black adam sees that evil people those who preach control and superiority over others should be eliminated and killed  pretty much as every other antihero  and throughout his way his views are meddled with the acts of people he meets along the way like the jsa that on the other hand considers him a threat for as they share an opposing view to black adams through their conflict they find a new common enemy sabbac who leads both parties to take him down once and for all  the movie offers incredible visuals as well something that every scifi movie should nail considering its what makes them what they are  the characters were truly amazing dwayne and surprisingly for the first time really does act not for a second there did i feel its another generic dwayne the rock johnson role out there pierce brosnan is straight out dr fate out of the comics and the rest of the cast really did nail their roles but i wish they focused more on their introductions that seemed a bit underwhelming and also the entire sabbac arc that felt very rushed also wished they focused more on the relationship between fate and hawkman the same way they did with the subtle chemistry between cyclone and atom smasher  the comedy felt smooth and right on time not overused nor it is forced as well as varied black adams comedy shines best at his ignorance of modern matters and atom smasher at his genuine clumsiness fate at his charismatic nitpicking and hawkman at his continuous arrogance and his accidents with atom smasher  the movie is definitely a good move for dc towards a brighter future and might be should be considered what dcs movies that have the same tone as black adam should thrive for
Oct 29 2022,positive,black adam is a good movie definitely deserves better then the critics gave it its all cgi but its good cgi pierce brosnan and aldis hodge are excellent
Oct 29 2022,positive,overall good movie  disliked both teen characters  added nothing to the story at all dhould not have been included  alsowhy kill off dr fate
Oct 29 2022,positive,just what it advertisespopcorn moviejust enjoy dont get too seriously involved the rock is always fun to watch
Oct 29 2022,positive,i hate super hero movies but this was dope
Oct 29 2022,positive,amazing action sequences brilliant visuals and impressive acting performances   definitely doesnt deserve all the harsh criticism it is receiving i bet if this was an mcu film the critics would have milked the tiniest details into praises
Oct 29 2022,positive,well acted loved the special effects
Oct 29 2022,positive,very formulaic didnt much like the auxiliary characters
Oct 29 2022,positive,loved it always a fan of the rock and was not disappointed
Oct 29 2022,negative,black adam is an expensive knockoff indian action movie with american actors dc still makes the same mistakes in the movie where even dwayne johnson ends up as someone different we see again that story is not bought with money
Oct 29 2022,positive,5th time seeing it phenomenal movie

Oct 29 2022,positive,loved the action and the rock on screen as an antihero loved the post credit scene as well
Oct 29 2022,negative,i literally dont know what to say it felt more like a train of stuff steaming toward you than a film seriously this was early 00s superhero garbage cgi was the only commendable thing so im giving 1 star to talented teams behind it i want 2 hours of life back

Oct 29 2022,positive,one of the best dc movies its a must see fantastic cgi crazy good action
Oct 29 2022,negative,the cgi and hero clashes were the only redeeming qualities plot holes kill your ability to feel for characters and dwayne johnson is the rock in a hero costume
Oct 29 2022,positive,the little boy was corny and didnt know how to act
Oct 29 2022,positive,mcu fan boys and girls will trash the movie those with an open mind and are fans of superheroes and comics in general one joy the action in the movie itself by far the best dc movie since the batman trilogy this is truly a start where dc can be competitive with mcu
Oct 29 2022,positive,the movie is awesomethe rock is started an era
Oct 29 2022,positive,very entertaining outing by the rocks black adam other characters could use a bit of polish cgi was too tier banter was spot on  funny looking forward to black adams role in the overall dc world

Oct 29 2022,positive,action all throughout the movie and cool story
Oct 29 2022,positive,i waited from long time too see this movie after i saw rock insta post that he is appearing as black adam really loved the movie
Oct 29 2022,positive,great action flick and a pretty solid plot twist but they always have to throw in some unnecessary goofball humor to lighten the mood it didnt need to be shazam we already got that sequel
Oct 29 2022,positive,good movie cant wait for part 2
Oct 29 2022,positive,the movie had plenty of action i enjoyed seeing dwayne johnson and such a big role he had a big personality to match the world and it was all around enjoyable

Oct 29 2022,positive,awesome movie the rock was perfect for the role
Oct 29 2022,negative,flimsy plot  boring  about an hour too long  real disappointment
Oct 29 2022,positive,i dont understand the hate for this movie i really liked it  im a marvel fan and i thought this was really good  he actually kills people anti hero stuff  the action scene were well done  i liked the rocks acting in it  the only thing i wasnt a fan of is hawkmans acting 
Oct 29 2022,neutral,started with promiseuntil the annoying teenage boy was introduced this led to several plotholes and an unneeded cgimess of a villain that was introduced to take it to a twohour runtime feel free to leave before the demon gets introduced and youll walk away feeling satisfied
Oct 29 2022,positive,this was a fun movie to watch ignore the critics
Oct 29 2022,positive,filled with fun action and enjoyable comedy black adam has tons of exciting suspense
Oct 29 2022,positive,once the rock shows up on screen it is a non stop action packed thrill ride comic book fans must see
Oct 29 2022,negative,possibly one of the worst movies i have ever paid to go see the whole film is messy action scenes with no tone and no heart continuous and unnecessary scores playing throughout the movie become a distraction as theyre over used classic movies use orchestras to build suspense picture the imperial march star wars then fade out as quality story and dialogue plays out when theyre playing the entirety of the film they have no impact on the emotion of the story also they plane looked like a penis so so so bad
Oct 29 2022,positive,one of my favorite super hero films simply due to acknowledging the antihero theme my 12 year old gave this a huge thumbs up
Oct 29 2022,positive,action start to finish and 2 hours flew by all enjoyed it and a nice break from having to think too much
Oct 29 2022,positive,in a nutshell  nearly 5000 years after he was bestowed with the almighty powers of the egyptian gods and imprisoned just as quickly black adam is freed from his earthly tomb ready to unleash his unique form of justice on the modern world    this superhero movie is a perfect example of the gigantic chasm between how film critics and audiences experience movies  critics hate it giving it a low score of 39 on rotten tomatoes while audiences are loving and praising it with a 90 score    that being said everyone agrees that this may point to a new beginning of superhero stories for dc movies  the film was directed by jaume colletserra  the writing team includes adam sztykiel rory haines and sohrab noshirvani    jaume colletserra also directed dwayne johnson in the movie jungle cruise in 2021  i recommend it    ive never read comic books but i know that fans have huge expectations for their movie adaptations  id love to hear what you think of this movie  comment down below   personally i prefer marvel movies over dc  how about you    things i liked  ive been a huge fan of dwayne the rock johnson for many years and am thrilled that he is finally a superhero  he looked bigger than life in this action flick and did a fantastic job with the material he was given  he also produced the movie  the great cast includes aldis hodge pierce brosnan noah centineo sarah shahi quintessa swindell marwan kenzari and bodhi sabongui  the humorous moments are subtle but always welcome  there are some entertaining oneliners  theres almost nonstop action  some of the cgi is very good and believable  it would definitely look the best on a large screen  keep watching during the rolling credits for another scene with an exciting cameo from a favorite superhero who says black adam we should talk  loved it     things i didnt like  some of the cgi looked super fake  so much exposition  there are many scenes where people have to talk to explain whats going on and what the backstory was all about  captain marvel also invokes the acronym shazam but the letters in the word stand for completely different things than they do for black adam  even with all of the action i found myself a little bored at times  if you dont enjoy superhero movies you definitely wont enjoy this one  its filled with cliches and even a few copycat moments from marvel     tips for parents     so much violence  so much destruction  some profanity     themes  heroes  family  freedom  violence  justice  darkness  power  fate    you can see the full review on the movie review mom youtube channel
Oct 29 2022,positive,i am  a marvel person but after this movie i think i will turn to a dc person  i never liked the rock but honestly he was born for this role   amazing amazing amazing
Oct 29 2022,positive,better than expected dc doing better
Oct 29 2022,negative,fun and visually appealing action sequences dont make up for an utter lack of logic in the story and poor chemistry between most of the heroes the longer answer is this movie has an awful script especially for taking over a decade to make the action tries to make up for it but unless you sleep between those set pieces i dont know how the story doesnt have you laughing at how nothing makes sense and so much is contrived which incidentally will be nearly all the laughs as i thought only 1 intentional joke landed the whole movie it also should bother most comic book fans with the changes including black adam having an unclear origin distinction between him and shazam something not muddled in the comics and i still cant figure out why they chose not to do the comic origin or close to it and if you care about dr fate he got the mix of silver surfer treatment from ff2 rotss and venom in sm3 where his powers work differently than the comics in a negative way to the character and story and the character is inexplicably always removing his helmet clearly to give the actors face more screen time wait for this to be ok streaming unless you think its worth it to see the action on the big screen with surround sound 
Oct 29 2022,positive,based on past dc movies i kept waiting for black adam to fall apart and just become blah it didnt entertaining movie better acting and story than most of the past dc movies my own opinion black adam is on par with wonder women and then shazam if you watch it i would suggest going in without thinking too much of what dc movies have been or wanting to compare it to the marvel movies
Oct 29 2022,neutral,so so movie i appreciated the humor but the long drug put fight scenes were tedious and far too many of them
Oct 29 2022,positive,saw it tuesday thought it was great cant wait to see it again
Oct 29 2022,positive,what a breath a fresh air a good ole fashion super hero flick was it amazing no was it terrible no was it fun yes  rock for knocking some sense into dc
Oct 29 2022,positive,when i saw the huge discrepancy between the critics low score for black adam juxtaposed against the very high audience score i knew that this would be a great movie and it was  likewise i always run in the opposite direction from any movie where i see skyhigh critical ratings combined with a low audience score my system proves to be uncannily precise i suggest others try it you wont be disappointed
Oct 29 2022,positive,the rock carries the movie just like any other  the storyline is somewhat weak but he makes the rest of the movie fun
Oct 29 2022,positive,i am extremely impatient when it comes to investing my time in a movie i had read the critics reviews of black adam and seen the teasers and trailers i am not a dwyane johnson fan but i wanted to judge black adam for myself so i got in my car and drove to the nearest cinema paid my money and found a descent seat and watched black adam without any expectations but ready to walk out  first and foremost black adam is a superhero movie and in that regard i was not disappointed and i certainly did not feel like walking out the back story of black adam and justice society were compelling black adams relationship with the mom and her son was an element i did not expect and instantly drawn to given that black adam is supposed to be a murdering superhero the back story of the nemesis was compelling did not drag on and the final showdown brought the movie to an awesome conclusion however when superman appears at the end and tells black adam we have to talk it was absolutely powerful  i love this movie and look forward to the sequel
Oct 29 2022,positive,5 out of 5 stars black adam is an awesome superhero film that is big action packed and it delivers a big blockbuster film dwayne johnson who is producing and starring in the film has been dedicated to this project for years its finally out in the big screen and he takes the project and delivered it to his fans they can expect a big blockbuster action film and delivering the anti hero dc character the plot is good showing adam dwayne johnson brought back in the present time when a group of mercenaries are after a crown which can resurrect evil adam takes justice into his own hands and is on the search for the crown with the help of adrianna sarah shahi while the justice society lead by hawkman aldis hodge is on the hunt to stop adam from leaving a huge body count the film is non stop action with one set piece to another the action sequences are big and exciting the visual effects are great dwayne johnson delivers with the role along with aldis hodge noah centineo quintessa swindell and pierce brosnan with there roles in the justice society sarah shahi did great as well marwan kenzari as the villain was also good the film is exciting and it is one fun entry in the dc franchise with giving a fast paced direction which it may over shadow any development to any characters and story it is one adrenaline fueled direction that will put the audiences into a wild action ride that makes you want to see it again there is a mid credit scene that will have the audiences cheering for another film
Oct 29 2022,positive,its a fun action movie
Oct 29 2022,positive,not the best i have seen but fun unlimited
Oct 29 2022,positive,hands lots and lots of hands you want to see someone get given the hands this is the movie for you
Oct 29 2022,positive,all characters were interesting and worth getting excited about black adams background and motivations are presented in an entertaining way adam smasher and cyclone are just okay no problems or anything great about the presentation of the characters hawkman and doctor were well done but kents death was underwhelming moreover the fight scenes with all the characters were awesome must watch in theatres but doctor fate and the main villain were just okay i expected more from fate the main villain was the worst part of the film his design was bland and boring too much red as for the rock he did an amazing job as black adam cant wait for sequels and crossovers with the man of steel and jl good movie fun action simple story
Oct 29 2022,positive,i really enjoyed the story line i wished they leaned heavier into the antiimperialism aspect though the action was great as well as the character development
Oct 29 2022,positive,great movie lots of action
Oct 29 2022,positive,as far a dc movies go it was easily the best decent storyline great post credit scene viola davis was the best actor with the least air time
Oct 29 2022,positive,ignore the negative feedback this film has it all dwayne johnson rocks as the anti hero and the supporting casts do their role justice a must see for true comic fans dc has the potential to be better than the marvel universe
Oct 29 2022,positive,certainly the best superhero movie of the year lots of action and zero woke ive never been a big fan of dc movies but this one certainly came to break paradigms it reminds a lot of how marvels films were in their golden age that is before being bought by disney and being completely corrupted by the excess of woke which no one can stand anymore
Oct 29 2022,negative,my kid got sick during the previews and fandango wont refund our tickets
Oct 29 2022,positive,best movie of the year  glad to finally see an action movie that did force political ideology on the masses of people who are absolutely sick of the politics trying divide us as a nation  a must see for everyone  absolutely would watch again
Oct 29 2022,positive,loved it good one time watch 
Oct 29 2022,positive,awesome movie where the rock has shut the mouth of all critics and save dc universe future  good movie just watch
Oct 29 2022,positive,second time watching in a week my family and i loved the movie
Oct 29 2022,positive,story was average but the action was dopeno laggy scenes for medont miss the mid credit scene
Oct 29 2022,negative,this is a bad movie i dont understand liking it or more accurately i dont understand not liking black widow eternals and love and thunder but liking this movie its objectively bad its bad when it somes to sound mixing and visuals to editing dialogue its just bad sure cyclone looks beautiful in slow motion and brosnans kent is really charming but that doesnt excuse the movie they are in
Oct 29 2022,positive,fun movieno woke stuff
Oct 29 2022,positive,if you havent watched it skip my comment first hour dragged on then it finally started picking up definitely predictable wasnt bad but wasnt the best either ill be watching the next one for sure because my favorite dc hereo will be in it  
Oct 29 2022,positive,previous films in the dceu have been very disappointing with lazy writing and bloated films that had storylines that were superficial with no payoff and felt empty or were moved along by coincidence after coincidence where even the heroes were just along for the ride and other superherocomics movies have been flat out terrible looking at you morbius     so i was skeptical that i would even enjoy this movie but dwayne johnson made me want to give it a chance i am glad that i did    the action was good and not so shaky cam or convoluted that i could barely keep up with what was happening the action is also consistent fun and sufficiently intense start to finish     the three main leads dwayne johnson aldis hodge and pierce brosnan were all very good in their roles i never thought i would like hawkman so much sarah shahi is a very good actress and remains one of the most beautiful women ever the way her role was written felt uneven but was also understandable based upon the plot the side characters atom smasher  cyclone were generic comic relief and for my wife and me they were only good in small doses we did not care about the characters and their disney channel feel seemed out of place in what otherwise felt like more of a serious gritty comic antihero flick    overall i am glad that i gave it a chance i have hope that dwayne johnson can save the dceu the way that blade saved marvel years ago
Oct 29 2022,positive,fun to watch predictable hawk man is a new addition  enjoy rock
Oct 29 2022,positive,i loved it by far the best dc movie in at least 10 years widely recomended
Oct 29 2022,positive,i didnt  think i was allowed to laugh  turn my brain off and have fun for a dceu movie
Oct 29 2022,positive,best dc movie i watch so far looking forward to seeing the flash
Oct 29 2022,positive,i like the story line is pretty close to the comic books the end after the credits   the next movies will bring in shazam kid well we shall see
Oct 29 2022,positive,this movie was awesome for the dceu actionpacked thrill ride
Oct 29 2022,positive,its a great movie so entertaining those marvel bot critics just hate everything about dc comics
Oct 29 2022,positive,dwayne johnson gave an awesome delivery as black adam its unexpected new and amazing lots of things happening with the actions the emotions and the characters but some of the aspect in the story just ruins the fearsome character of black adam this movie might not change dceu that much but this is just the beginning of the things that are coming its an amazing origin
Oct 29 2022,positive,too long it dragged
Oct 29 2022,positive,black adam was good but i didnt like fate of dr fate
Oct 29 2022,positive,not bad at all really surprising since all the reviewers were weirdlysuspiciously caning it compared to other most recent dc films this one is actually watchable and rewatchable ill give it a 45 and an 810 looking forward to the future of dc films for the first time
Oct 29 2022,positive,in like the good graphic
Oct 29 2022,positive,its a very good movie for fans and not fans of the dc universe because is full of interesting moments and characters that in my opinion makes the movie better
Oct 29 2022,positive,it was good but it could have gotten a bit more from the good crew and a little less time on long fights
Oct 29 2022,positive,usually like movies with the rock but i guess there is always an exception  almost walked out
Oct 29 2022,positive,the best dc film no junk only fun and action
Oct 29 2022,positive,hes the man of the people and the people love him also the movie is good
Oct 29 2022,positive,absolutely amazing way more than i expected phenomenal cast looks like it would be a great addition to the marvel avengers and that would be out of this world
Oct 29 2022,positive,the best superhero movie of dc universe finally something fresh and dwayne johnson has taken the role in high quality standards great action scenes cant wait to go see again black adam 1010 
Oct 29 2022,positive,great movie lots of action and suspense perfectly cast loved it
Oct 29 2022,positive,honestly went in expecting very little left thoroughly entertained strangely what made it wasnt the main character but a cast of very colourful and fun supporting actors a lot better than the other recent superhero outings ive seen
Oct 29 2022,positive,i loved everything about it the storyline the action  but i think they could have made the final battle a little more exciting sabbac didnt give me enough excitement  but apart from that it was a wonderful film
Oct 29 2022,positive,i think the plot is alright similar to typical hero movies but the battle scenes are a lot of fun it appeals to me a lot no grievances
Oct 29 2022,positive,if this is the way dc are headed ill be watching all of their movies  black adam is a fun entertaining movie dj is solid as black adam kinda has that t2 vibe if it was a longer movie they could have leant into that more   i liked all of the justice society pb was great as dr fate and realy liked this version of hawkman   i think i want a hawkman centric movie
Oct 29 2022,positive,had everything i wanted in a comic book movie fuckings amazing action and cgi the rock killed it as black adam and the story was beautiful with a good twist and the end credit made me happy again
Oct 29 2022,positive,it was fun such a lift up for us this year after watching that thor disappointment
Oct 29 2022,positive,exchanges between hawkman and black adam
Oct 29 2022,positive,for being a popcorn flick its actually quite amazing right behind mos and tss for me loved brosnan  hodges performances the rock is pretty badass as well weak villain and not as many connections historically to the jsa as there was in the comics but overall is still pretty good
Oct 29 2022,positive,extraordinary action
Oct 29 2022,positive,this movie really a hardcore fantastic action movie  i love the visual effects the movie is incredible this is far better than the reviews by the critics
Oct 29 2022,positive,surprisingly i actually loved this movie
Oct 29 2022,positive,if im going to be completely honest was it the most original superhero movie know but with the heart and commitment the rock had for this movie its hard not to see how hard he tried to make this movie as entertaining as possible and the actors were all awesome the fx were top notch as well to me it just felt like the writing could have been better for the main villain and maybe not been so easy to see coming when it came time to bring out his final boss form and from there on you knew what was going to happen way before it did  super solid action sprinkled with well timed comedy is more then enough reason to go see this tho
Oct 29 2022,positive,deep story and good character development 
Oct 29 2022,negative,this movie is 50 xmen and 50 avengers with terrible cgi and worse acting i like the rock but not in this movie he was too robotic and the other actors are much worse
Oct 29 2022,positive,really great we loved it dc headed on a right direction
Oct 29 2022,positive,one of the best movies ive ever seen amazing theme btw keep up the good work dc
Oct 29 2022,positive,too many things that threw me off that didnt make sense to me
Oct 29 2022,positive,get movie me and my family love the movie best movie we have seen for a long time and for the critics that said it was bad you should fire yourself and get someone else to do your job the critics are now little babys and scared but for the movie keep making them rock ill watch it
Oct 29 2022,positive,in my opinion it is one of my favourite superhero films rock gives his full potential to the film just love it
Oct 29 2022,positive,great movietwo words enough for it
Oct 29 2022,positive,solid action packed movie  enjoyed till first to last of the movie
Oct 29 2022,positive,i loved the movie it had action but also drama as well dwayne johnson did amazing with the black adam role and so did the other justice society of america heroes only atom smasher kind of felt out of place the presentation of the villain did not connect with me he was forgettable because we didnt understand the why and how he just came in and became the demons champion
Oct 29 2022,positive,just watched the movie and ohh man definitely a must watch movie that is meant to be seen in cinemas for sure hands down the rock kicked ass in it
Oct 29 2022,positive,fantastic movie i am super impressed by the direction that dc is going in on their movie front this movie really got me immersed and to care about the characters it is something that i have not seen in many superhero movies recently i look forward to what comes next for black adam and the dc universe in general and thats something that i never thought that i would say
Oct 29 2022,positive,this movie packs a punch and delivers a well needed introduction to more dc characters thats the fans have been waiting to see on the big screen black adams only fault is that it leaves you wanting to more the dceu can build so much off the past few films released and the ones to come black adam fits right in the fold black adam is action packed the right amount of cheesy humor and not only lets dwayne johnson shine as the leading man but gives new blood performances and veteran mainstays to dazzle the screen tremendous visuals and settings give the story great balance while looking deeper into the world of dc 910 in my book
Oct 29 2022,positive,the rock obviously but it was funny and acting packed and emotional the whole family loved it
Oct 29 2022,negative,is there anything less than a one star for a movie
Oct 29 2022,negative,the best movie ive ever seen sarcasm
Oct 29 2022,positive,bro the plot of the movie is okayish but the characters and the theatre experience is phenomenal movie is lit
Oct 29 2022,positive,the villain is as forgettable as the one in suicide squad
Oct 29 2022,positive,doctor fate stole the show hawkman was awesome black adam is one of the best dc movies behind man of steel
Oct 29 2022,positive,fun movie with good special effects and action  johnson is fine as black adam   but the movie is definitely flawed
Oct 29 2022,positive,loved this movie cant wait to see it again
Oct 29 2022,negative,horrible  scene after the credits made the whole movie
Oct 29 2022,positive,definitely needs a sequel with dwayne the rock johnson
Oct 29 2022,positive,it was such a refreshing superhero movie to watch reason being it had allll that superhero action youd get from a typical dc animationhonestly cant wait to see how the dcu picks up after bahopefully we get to see more dr fate
Oct 29 2022,positive,this movie was exactly what i wanted it to be superhumans being super powerful if this is the future of dc movies then i have high hopes
Oct 29 2022,negative,this movies main flaws are that it has too many characters and not enough direction not to mention its mediocre villain at times cringe worthy sfx and stupendously boring final battle even dwayne johnson who usually elevates blockbusters with his physical presence and likability was unusually wooden
Oct 29 2022,positive,good action good effects okay story not the best but far from the worst if you like the dc movies give it a shot
Oct 29 2022,positive,fantastic less dark more fun and entertaining bravo more super hero movies like this
Oct 29 2022,positive,not sure why paid critics are hating on this movie saw it and was thoroughly entertained
Oct 29 2022,positive,the movie is action packed fun beautiful cinematography and a fun time
Oct 29 2022,positive,very enjoyable movie overall simple storyline with some great action and fighting sequences pierce bronson stole the show in every scene his character was in solid entry into the dceu 7 out of 10
Oct 29 2022,neutral,there was no story whatsoever and what was a semblance of story was poor the action scenes were a nice change from normal dc fare in that you could see what was happening everything just felt rushed like this just needed to happen so they can add the character to the rest of the dceu
Oct 29 2022,positive,loved it it was amazing
Oct 29 2022,positive,action packed throughout absolutely one of the best movies ive seen in a while
Oct 29 2022,positive,visuals and actions are fantastic  dwayne johnson is like he is born to play black adam role i loved his attitude at many scenes story was quite good they narration of blackadam is impressive
Oct 29 2022,positive,awesome movie great action and doesnt succumb to the woke movement that have destroyed movies for the past 2 years dont listen to the critics probably one of dcs top films and the audience score really shows it
Oct 29 2022,positive,this critics are being paid or what i cannot understand how can be such difference between critics rates and peoples a lot of terrible movies and series highly rated and  viceversa
Oct 29 2022,positive,movie was great action was awesome
Oct 29 2022,positive,i thought it was a fun movie lots of action just the right amount of humor  i am one of those people who is sick of the rock being in every movie but he was perfect as black adam just like arnold was the perfect choice for playing a terminator lots of easter eggs too i might even go see it again this weekend
Oct 29 2022,positive,this is one of the best superhero movies ive ever seen the action was amazing the storyline was well laid out there was never a dull moment i cant wait for the followup
Oct 29 2022,positive,the movie was great my son and i really enjoyed it
Oct 29 2022,positive,everything perfect except boring story
Oct 29 2022,positive,i really loved the movie enjoyed every bit of it        it was worth watching and i am excited for the future projects for black adam  having rock as a super hero was long due and finally its here    yippee  
Oct 29 2022,positive,dwayne johnson as the title role is amazing and ruthless
Oct 29 2022,positive,let me just tell you i was amazed every minute the movie played cant tell you how well the rock did he killed this movie  cant wait to see more of dc
Oct 29 2022,positive,lets call it what it is this isnt high art and it shouldnt be judged as such what it is however is the most fun youll have with your pants on its a cinematic big screen loud funny romp from start to finish we bought a good time when we got the tickets for this movie and black adam absolutely delivered ive got action explosions the motherfudgin rock come on   watch it take your friends take a stranger enjoy life with a fun loud movie that takes your mind off of everything and leaves you with the question how many normal human sized legs would it take to make one of the rocks thighs christ theyre huge anyway really enjoyed it solid flick
Oct 29 2022,positive,maybe ive just watched a lot of movies but this one was played out for the very beginning you knew what was gonna happen in the first 2min dwayne the rock johnson plays himself per usual the movie was rushed but felt more rushed because of the music selection that never ended the lines were very repetitive and too much slomo i will say the action was what you wanted and it delivered on that to a t i would def watch again despite all the negative opinions i had for the movie
Oct 29 2022,positive,love it such a great movie
Oct 29 2022,positive,its a movie full of action i love all the jsa members and movie was awesome
Oct 29 2022,negative,the rock tried so hard to be the next superman antagonist black adam will eventually fulfill the characters full potential only if its released from this painfully rubbish set of shackles that the filmmakers called a screenplay idiotically predictable ideological messages are getting so old now that i wonder when this script was actually green lit
Oct 29 2022,positive,love but interesting and good
Oct 29 2022,positive,all around great movie cant wait to see how the next movie unfolds
Oct 29 2022,negative,from my point of view this movie was extremely violent  i got a headache and needed to go to the park to clear my mind  i do not recommend at all
Oct 29 2022,positive,great movie incredible action with a decent storyline it was definitely overhyped but still a great movie
Oct 29 2022,positive,great movie better than expected started a little slow but ended well lots of action and some humor made this movie very good hoping more dc films start being like this
Oct 29 2022,positive,i liked it one of the best dc movies only thing id put above it is superman and zs jl he was an antihero with a complicated past coming to terms with the new world and how he fits in it i think it fits perfectly with the times today because we arent all good or all bad plus only 2 white people in it so thats always a bonus when its not whitewashed for hollywood it had humor that was a bit corny but thats what made it cater to the young audience fight scenes were well shot imo but one scene had a lot of slow mo parts of somebody getting their ass kicked wont say who how the movie concluded was kinda foreshadowed but still satisfying  acting wise  there were two characters i felt like couldve been left out the movie but again thats who brought the corny humor and brings in the youngins but not essential to the plot at all dwayne did good as an anti hero he barely smiled which i feel like is a 180 for him because hes always smiling and goofy in movies we got to see him play someone serious they brought in hawk guy and dr fate which i liked they did a good job with quietly setting up future movies and plots without taking over the current plot
Oct 29 2022,positive,one of the best dc movies ive seen it definitely brought the comic to life
Oct 29 2022,positive,loved the character of dr fate story wise movie is ok but the role played by all the superheroes is just awesome dc jas done justice to all the super heroes in the movie full of action and the post credit gave a super hype for the next part of black adam
Oct 29 2022,positive,a typical antihero becomes the actual hero comic book made movie story not bad not great no real surprises or plot twists just some good entertainment it had some promise with the premise a small invaded country being stripped of its resources rallies behind a hero the justice league thinks is really a bad guy complete with a ripped off batman line of not the hero they deserve but the hero they need what was really unnecessary and through me for a loop was minor spoiler all the satanic imagery and literal red devil with horns that shows up as the big bad guy the rock has to fight in the end but ultimately this movie had some good one liners and did a decent job of confronting a morally superior policing force jl and asking why they get to decide whos good and whos bad 
Oct 29 2022,positive,all i can say is i have a new pet rock and his name is dwayne johnson or as i like to call him well you get it this movie isnt about the hero you expected but the one you deserve mary poppins meets walking tall and a spoon full of sugar makes the sweet cold justice go down in the most delightful way
Oct 29 2022,negative,tired old predictable  and those were the actors  the plotline was even worse    i really like the rock and he is fun to watch but even he couldnt save it
Oct 29 2022,positive,absolutely fantastic the action sequences are more impressive
Oct 29 2022,positive,fun action packed movie
Oct 29 2022,positive,great action mid acting
Oct 29 2022,positive,a little long needed to intro justice society better
Oct 29 2022,neutral,its clear that the writers were trying to tell a compelling story with the character but the action takes front stage and makes the movie feel much longer than it should
Oct 29 2022,positive,got me hyped from beginning to end
Oct 29 2022,positive,i mean lol the writing isnt great and if you stare long enough the plot has so many holes and yet it totally works it just does and i dont fully understand it dwayne johnson is great pierce brosnan was absolutely brilliant and the rest of the cast did a fantastic job selling their characters and the story throw some jokes in there some almost nonstop action and it just absolutely works
Oct 29 2022,positive,love it can wait to get it on bluray
Oct 29 2022,positive,great superhero movie bringing in plenty of cool charecters good story good action and amazing graphics

Oct 29 2022,positive,went in expecting not to really like it especially since i havent liked any of the dc movies since man of steel husband really wanted to see it though being a big fan on the rock was pleasantly surprised it was an overall fun comic book movie yes there were some cheesy parts but absolutely loved pierce brosnan in it acting was overall pretty good and of course the end credit scene made me excited for the next movie that they were laying the groundwork for if youre looking for something deep this is not the movie for you but if youre looking for something entertaining that is an unabashed comic book movie this is it 
Oct 29 2022,positive,nice origin film for black adam entertaining and with decent pacing

Oct 29 2022,positive,awesome movie  it was freaking bad azz
Oct 29 2022,positive,here we find a great origin movie with a simple script but that fulfills its role the rock was born for this role mister fate and hawkman are wonderful on screen i highly recommend
Oct 29 2022,positive,i just saw this movie today it is a great movie full of action nearly the entire way through the dcu really found its tone and cadence with black adam it has a great mix of fun serious and comic adaptation i dont know where the critics are coming from but this is a great comic book movie this is also a great action movie for anyone not into the comics dj has a dominating presence on the screen and i cant wait to see how the new dcu unfolds from here
Oct 29 2022,positive,dc is stepping up best dc movie i have seen since man of steel
Oct 29 2022,positive,decent enough to watch for second time

Oct 29 2022,positive,one of the best dc movies i have seen
Oct 29 2022,neutral,nonstop action but i expected more from dwayne story was a sometimes hard to follow a little more humor would have made it more fun i wouldnt see the sequel
Oct 29 2022,positive,overall the movie was pretty good i felt like there were certain moments within the movie that were forced definitely one of the better dc films however i wish dc just tried a little harder to make those moments less cringe overall though not a bad movie to reignite the dying flame of the dc universe
Oct 29 2022,positive,literally best dc movie in the entire franchise i dont even know why they made other movies aquaman who
Oct 29 2022,positive,thiis move was amazing the one negative thing i have to say is it should have been r rated that would have been better but none the less 5 minutes into the movie people already getting killed

Oct 29 2022,negative,didnt like the story line couldnt keep track of the story
Oct 29 2022,positive,it is awesome at first i thought dwayne doesnt fit for the role but boy was i wrong he did a great job casting black adam and the ending gave me chills
Oct 29 2022,negative,movie was very corny but im mainly giving the 1 12 starts for all of the satanic symbolism the rock did good tho
Oct 29 2022,negative,it was just really bad the acting was subpar and the plot was pointless i knew going in it was going to be an over the top comic movie but it was just so poorly done
Oct 29 2022,positive,very entertaining nonstop action
Oct 29 2022,positive,it was a very enjoyable movie
Oct 29 2022,positive,such an incredible ride from beginning to end the characters were given plenty of time to be built throughout the action was fierce and black adam had phenomenal moments lines fights all of it the critics got this one wrong for sure
Oct 29 2022,positive,the movie was spectacular i cant wait to see black adam vs superman
Oct 29 2022,negative,actual poo literal human faeces

Oct 29 2022,positive,was very long but good did bring out my autism tho
Oct 29 2022,positive,i loved the new dc characters this movie added to the big screen the after credit scene with superman made me feel like a kid again for the most part i usually agree with the critics but not this time i am not sure why they are giving it such a low score but it is a must see for any dc fan also seems like the snyder verse isnt dead just yet
Oct 29 2022,positive,this movie is a fresh of breath air from the drivel from marvel movies recently  the action pieces in this film are amazing and dwayne johnson play black adam perfectly dc superhero films are making a comeback against marvel
Oct 29 2022,negative,if you believe that a human or whatever he is suppose to be can throw a 10 ton rock 30 miles or jump in the air faster than a jet like earth has no gravity then this is for you
Oct 29 2022,positive,i really liked how we had an even use of heroes and anti heroes when the moment came for heroes to seemingly take the limelight black adam reminds you whose movie it is
Oct 29 2022,positive,pleasantly surprised this movie has really good visuals and and a pretty good story line the fight scenes were really entertaining
Oct 29 2022,positive,here we go again the movie was generally good perhaps with another actor taking the mantle of the leading man it would have been better but we are grateful for what its protagonist has achieved for the dc universe  i think the movie was underrated when it is very good despite everything    the script had many faults perhaps some flavor was missing mostly in the villain story his motives and desires were absurd that didnt help the plot he is a villain that we will easily forget  the scene editing the cgi the action scenes and the costumes did their homework dazzle the audience    a round of applause for brosnan as dr fate hodge as hawkman and the rest of the heroes with whom the protagonist shared scenes and understand that everyone will want more from them and above all thank you for giving the fans what they want yes we are talking about the longawaited return of henry cavill as superman now thats a real new hope that will maintain the hipe in the fans
Oct 29 2022,positive,cringe level 5 compared to dr strangers cringe level 7 and justice league cringe level 9
Oct 29 2022,positive,full of action much better than expected  cant wait to see what james gunn adds to the dc universe
Oct 29 2022,positive,to be honest this movie is way more serious interesting and exciting than shazam one of the best movies 
Oct 29 2022,positive,suits actually dont miss 
Oct 29 2022,neutral,so bad it was fun and pretty good the rock was an appropriate actor for the role
Oct 29 2022,positive,fun to see more dc characters on the big screen
Oct 29 2022,positive,this movie kicks so much ass black adam was like if an 80s schwarzenegger movie got made with todays technology and special effects and budget my son and i loved it
Oct 29 2022,positive,movie was better than expected
Oct 29 2022,neutral,the movie was decent but not enough humor mixed in and they spent so much time pushing the narrative of whether hes a hero or not that you start to wonder why anyone wants his help
Oct 29 2022,negative,i never wathced this movie yet but i love rock the john dwayneson
Oct 29 2022,positive,i liked the actors in the movie it was however a very dark movie im used to seeing dwayne johnson in a more light spirited movie pierce brosnan was absolutely a dream i liked the movie but i wish it wasnt so dark oh well he saved the day so i guess it was worth it 
Oct 29 2022,positive,had a great time from beginning to end  tons of action and the plot rolled out pretty fast  and kept moving along  really fun movie with way more heart than expected
Oct 29 2022,positive,despite what the critics are saying this is a very good superheroor at the least a very good superantihero movie i have no idea what most of these professional idiots or selfappointed culture curators are thinking with their thoughts about this film its certainly not perfect but its entertaining and tells the story it promises to deliver what are they expecting with this genre shakespeare give me a break and go watch some arthouse garbage this is enjoyable entertainment for the masses dwayne johnson reels in his big personality to play the title role with shades and tints despite the title there is not much black and white here characters make strong arguments for their actions be they heroic or a little more vengeful pierce brosnan aldis hodge and sarah shahi are very good in their roles in particular brosnan steals every scene hes in i would love to see more of his dr fate and the midcredit scene was very satisfying i appreciate the work johnson and his producing team put in to make that happen they went about the bad decision of dcs former movie boss and found a way to give many many fans what they wanted congratulations mr johnson i look forward to the next adventure of black adam
Oct 28 2022,positive,excellent movie critics got it wrong 
Oct 28 2022,positive,one of the best dc movies that i have ever seen
Oct 28 2022,positive,colour by the numbers is just fine if you can stay between the lines
Oct 28 2022,positive,i loved it the rock in rare form
Oct 28 2022,positive,same rock movies same acting in all his movies im big i have muscles i have the same stupid face nothing new not bad nor good but ok either this or watch ryans world on youtube gonna be rocky boy no other options
Oct 28 2022,positive,this film has good visuals the storyline is easy to understand even though this film is still in the process of introducing the character of black adam itself   this is one of the films that shows a lot of epic battles and spoils the eyes
Oct 28 2022,positive,packed full of action comedy and thrills the whole way through dc is finally catching marvel and with this momentum can take them off of their throne as the new leader in comic book movies
Oct 28 2022,positive,fast paced enjoyable and the mid credit scene sets us up so well great movie and fans love it critics seems to be expecting something elsebut we dont care well done dwayne the dc universe should lift from here 
Oct 28 2022,positive,amazing movie loved the cast and the fight scenes were amazing
Oct 28 2022,positive,very fun fights  pancadaria do começo ao fim kkk
Oct 28 2022,positive,painfully mediocre good action set pieces but a bad script with some questionable acting choices the kid mostly at least its not boring
Oct 28 2022,positive,i recommend the audience to watch the movie you wont regret it one thing ive been realizing for some time is that if the critics say its bad the movie is good
Oct 28 2022,positive,the plot was somewhat predictable but the action and characters kept me interested and entertained which is what a movie like this is supposed to do looking forward to part 2 the rock needs to get with shazam though like for real
Oct 28 2022,positive,my tweens loved the action great special effects  enjoyable storyline and comic relief  the rock suits the role
Oct 28 2022,positive,the action was great but there was no real story it was set in one little town and there was no development throughout the film wasted opportunity tbh but a lot better than the woke fest marvel has been pushing down our throats
Oct 28 2022,positive,i went to see the movie with my son i had low expectations but that quickly changed when black adam went on a killing rampage definitely unexpected for the rock however this movie adds a new depth to the scale of performance he can deliver
Oct 28 2022,positive,gotta like it when the rock plays a bad guy
Oct 28 2022,positive,awesome action movie this is some kind of an old school superhero experience but with up to date cgi dc has returned from a long journey thanks to the rock and henry c  sorry marvel you are no more now its time for dcu to shine 
Oct 28 2022,positive,its the rock being an antihero in an action film and magic im definitely going to buy it when i comes out thats my personal opinion though
Oct 28 2022,positive,funny action packed and visually stunning 
Oct 28 2022,positive,movie was amazing i love the back story well put together and the action is on point i heard great reviews on the movie and after watching it they were right
Oct 28 2022,positive,the movie was a awesome and i cant wait for a sequel to happen also never listen this is why you should never listen to critics because sometimes they dont know what theyre talking about
Oct 28 2022,positive,great movie will see again
Oct 28 2022,positive,i like the movie it definitely brings out dc vibe but the story should have ended when someone went underwater they could have made 2 part for this movie instead prolonging it so much i dont wanna watch movie for more than 145 minutes with end credit scene included
Oct 28 2022,negative,bro i made this account in 2 minutes and left this feedback
Oct 28 2022,positive,i know people are getting tired of superheros but this is one of the best of dcs offerings
Oct 28 2022,positive,a great movie that delivered action and comedy cant wait for the series
Oct 28 2022,positive,i thought black adam was great another super hero the story was good and the action was superb
Oct 28 2022,positive,wasnt expecting much but overall it was a really good movie i can nitpick some things in the movie but it was good and worth going to
Oct 28 2022,positive,theres a screeching in the throne room  theres howls of pain from the palace  theres countless people huddled beneath the mightys domineering prowess  theres saving a people all for yourself  then theres freeing the people to serve no one else    its the gods thunder in a mortal man  not virtuous nor perfect not kneeling to the kings of old or new neo libcon malice  checkpoints and mandates and armies crashing down heroes stick their noses in while blind to those on the ground    this isnt the way it should be  self aggrandizing  perfect lineage and ideology cowards  justified justice justly still trying to control devils wearing gold and lace so smug and bleeding proud    weak    menace of intentions good yet  heroes too power seek but sometimes its just given  erupts from places unbidden sometimes the call to do the right thing doesnt come from the perfect or balanced    let the angels rumble fearfully for a gift they gave thats lost gods kingdom let it crumble along with devils greedy wrath    our land belongs to us on earth  our land belongs to none  no crown or throne over   we the people  this is the dreadful song    that the powers that be   can always be wrong   in angel wings or devil skins  to each of them give none    hierarchy pity party  cry more and crave that throne  but if we break the princes cage  well well write a liberated song    your throne is for the birds  your ambitions be ash in wind  your commandments need not your preside  down with invaders whims    the people hold the truest gold  the right in us is heart  the dispensers  necromancers  reanimating their worthless worth    behold your crumbling palace devil  behold your shattered kingdom god  behold the only power truly  was us  the suffering sods    fate beyond your pantheons  will give to any gifts  and old power   be but dried flowers  a curiosity in books   to be pressed    some people see a way to break  a way to bend  to rule  but the only path  thats got a life    is the one was never ruled     mark hurdiss    this is seriously a poem about a chuffing superhero movie go watch black adam     pretty obvious why critics hate it 
Oct 28 2022,positive,i enjoyed the plot and the i didnt see that coming segment very interesting concept i am a believer that the righteous  must become as the unrighteous until order is restored and all returned to normal
Oct 28 2022,positive,i loved it so much true dc the rock makes a legend
Oct 28 2022,positive,revolutionary it has been a long time since ive seen such a brutal hero movie
Oct 28 2022,positive,this movie shows the work that was put in it i believe it was an exciting and thrilling experience its one of the best dc movies to date
Oct 28 2022,positive,loved this movie  action humor great lead actor supporting cast and villain    everyone just needs to watch it
Oct 28 2022,positive,the movie has good acting soso plot amazing visual and very good cgi its good i recommend if u want a movie just to pass the time
Oct 28 2022,positive,simple and straightforward storyline which worked perfectly fine for this type of film with great action and vfx a fun time at the movies for comic fans and general moviegoers
Oct 28 2022,positive,i thought it was a good movie it had good character development i can say that the action in the movie was great special effects was topnotch only downfall to it was corny scenes
Oct 28 2022,positive,very fun and enjoyable movie after a heavy day work easy and straightforward
Oct 28 2022,negative,even dwaynes charisma couldnt saves this film from the horrible dialogs and terrible storyline dc needs better writers
Oct 28 2022,positive,black adam is the number 1 movie in the world the sheer masculinity each line spoken by dwayne johnson is enough to keep any viewer interested also pierce brosnans dr fate was truly chilling the other actors did great too and even more minor roles were executed to perfection
Oct 28 2022,positive,alright plot good action i like the balance between seriousness and comedy all in all a good direction for dc
Oct 28 2022,positive,absolutely loved the moviea good balance of catchy dialogue action and humour
Oct 28 2022,positive,black adam revived dc hawkman was a frustrating character to try and like and i didnt care for the over saturated hero talk from the team in the beginning the forced funny music montage in the first fight scene left a sour taste the first fight was insanely good until that moment dwayne johnson finally broke his reputation of being the rock in every role very solid movie from dc after so long
Oct 28 2022,positive,left the cinema thinking marvel now looks like little cute puppies with no balls this is the benchmark of badass big action and a superp counter narrative on the antihero dc finally landed a real blow
Oct 28 2022,positive,this is just a good old fashion superhero slug fest with witty banter exciting action where the only message is enjoy the show  this is a refreshing break from dull preachy unhero movies that have been thrown out there for the last few years
Oct 28 2022,positive,loved this movie so much so action packed and idc what anyone says negative about the story just forget all biases and be a child again
Oct 28 2022,negative,full of missed opportunities  very disappointed  the only thing that got me excited was the post credit trailer after the movie  maybe a second chance for black adam to show us what hes got
Oct 28 2022,positive,fun to watchcould replay for hours another brilliant performance from dwayne 
Oct 28 2022,positive,great filmgreat movie with exciting action throughout excellent special effects and a lot of fight scenes everything people want to see in superhero movies
Oct 28 2022,negative,yea poor acting didnt draw you in i feel asleep quarter the way though it
Oct 28 2022,positive,this was ok but another example of how warners doesnt know what it wants from the dceu why would you introduce a cinema version of the justice league with only hawkman excellent dr fate why pierce brosnan and then two clevel background characters i know its actually because the rock didnt want attention diverted from him but whos running the asylum i dont know much about black adam and unfortunately didnt learn much from the film except his brutality which is fine but brutality doesnt make me want to see him again the absolute best moment of this movie was after the movie ended when cavill showed up there were only a handful of people in the audience when i saw black adam and the response was palpable just like when wonder woman showed up in batman v superman with her shield and swordand that guitar riff the best part of the of that movie its obvious warners doesnt have a plan hopefully james gunn takes charge and sorts out that mess dc has a huge stable of great characters and story lines just no one driving the boat
Oct 28 2022,negative,i want to say i love the rock i wanted to love this movie but its a waste of time action for actions sake but boring
Oct 28 2022,positive,an entertaining superhero movie i dont know what the critics were feeling or why they hated this movie but honestly i had a great time watching this in theaters i will own this own this movie when it comes on dvd bluray andor 4k
Oct 28 2022,positive,a paint by numbers comic book movie that executes on all fronts  is highly entertaining
Oct 28 2022,positive,ok i dont want spoil but its a really good movie the post credit scene is really good i hope this magic continue et start a real dcu i want more movie like this
Oct 28 2022,positive,ok  so black adam is a pretty good movie  the superhero movies we have seen this year kinda felt downgraded but black adam was comparatively good  its full of action sequences and the visuals and cgi are also pretty nice  the key role of this movie is definately black adam  hawkman and dr fates character  i didnt like some character  the dialogue delivery from isiss actress didnt really felt emotional to me  atom smasher and cyclones characters were average  and they didnt did justice to dr fates character overall its a 355 from me    in a nutshell    pros    action  vfx  cgi   hawkman  black adam  dr fates character    cons    poor storyline  fight in the end felt less climatic  some characters felt poorly written eg isis  atom smasher  cyclone
Oct 28 2022,positive,i really dont know what the professional critics have against this one okay it was outrageous but it was entirely entertaining
Oct 28 2022,positive,it is the best and interesting movie of dc after shazam
Oct 28 2022,positive,best dc movie since the nolan trilogy hands down hopefully this is a turning point for dc universe
Oct 28 2022,positive,amazing fore action but wasted potential unfortunately
Oct 28 2022,positive,ive never agreed with critics anyway first movie in theaters since 2020 it wasnfun heroes that ive never seen on the big screen brosnan as fate and dwayne as black adam were my absolute standouts felt very much like watching a dc animated movie more please
Oct 28 2022,positive,i thought it was a really good movie  there is lots of action and they do explain why he is not exactly a good guy but can be so sometimes  it is a comic book movie so why expect high art from it  it is not that  it is simple fun
Oct 28 2022,positive,i thought it was very entertaining
Oct 28 2022,positive,best superhero movie since avengers end game top 3 all time the rock was epic great effects and superman returning at the end topped it off will be watching it again v soon 
Oct 28 2022,positive,awesome movie i feel like dc is finally getting back on track and heading in the right direction definitely need to give it a try
Oct 28 2022,positive,great origin story im more of a marvel fan but i was enjoyed what they did with this movie the rock was awesome
Oct 28 2022,positive,very interesting storyline i do like that its not another squeaky clean hero also the twist was very interesting as well didnt realize it was going to be so violent but thats on me overall i give it four stars
Oct 28 2022,positive,was it derivitave and not the greatest storysure  considering the genre and overall quality of effects it was just fine as a superhero film  especially with the intro of superman at the end 
Oct 28 2022,positive,great action great acting from dwayne johnson and pierce brosnan especially few complaints though one being too many slowmo shots another being the dialogue in certain parts being a little off
Oct 28 2022,positive,i thought is a good movie overall would recommend it to anyone who likes dc
Oct 28 2022,positive,the criticism is bought how is it possible that she hulk has more votes in favor than black adam the criticism is shit just like the current marvel movies they are bought
Oct 28 2022,positive,a perfect leave your brain at the door movie  i loved both the action and the humor
Oct 28 2022,negative,1 black adam returned after 5000 years and just immediately adjusted to the changes around him there was no akwardness and he seemed to just know about everything in the modern world including riding an airplane  2 dr fates sacrifice scene was a wasted opportunity to connect with the audience due to no character building would have been better if we were shown the relationship built between he and hawkman first it left the audience with questions instead of feeling the emotions of the scene   3 a lot of elements were taken from other superhero movies a lot of similarities the movie lacks originality  4 the country was overtaken by a foreign company and everyone seems to be just ok with it unrealistic  5 very week antagonist no character building just all of a sudden turned into a demon  6 cgi was great  7 fightaction scenes were great  8 acting was respectable
Oct 28 2022,neutral,great action scenes soso plot overall fun and enjoyable movie
Oct 28 2022,positive,although many may disagree but dcu is in the right track black adam doesnt hold back to show its behind suicide squad 2020 and 2020 justice league  while you expect to see the basic hero plot this shows that not everything is as it seems black adam shows that this new age of heros is going to be a blast showing the capable power of what holds ahead accompanied by a nice kiss from the end credits
Oct 28 2022,positive,loved the movie i have never written a review before but i thought i owe this one a review because the critics are trashing it the jsa was amazing too and i wish we could see more of dr fate cant wait to see a sequel to this movie with perhaps superman
Oct 28 2022,positive,black adam is a breath of fresh air after having to watch comic book movies slowly die due to politics and releases that dont consider the feelings of those who respect the art of comic books the action is heavy and the message is clear some monsters require a monster to keep them in check
Oct 28 2022,positive,an actionpacked film and really enjoyed the rock as black adam  would recommend to audiences of all ages
Oct 28 2022,positive,its a shallow but entertaining popcorn flick worth a watch
Oct 28 2022,positive,great story and action packed
Oct 28 2022,positive,great action comedy was welcome but not overdone
Oct 28 2022,positive,this movie is a very good entrance for the caracther and the postcredits scene is one of the best in the superhereo movies  and the special effects are much better than marvel
Oct 28 2022,positive,a decent movie plot made sense and the actions sequences were good
Oct 28 2022,positive,the rock was irrepressible and as always the rock made the picture  but the rest was kind of a jumble of halfbaked superish characters ostensibly part of the justice league but without the usual cast of alist superheros   hawkman was annoyingly sacrosanct  lots of normal overthetop smashing and clobbering  i was ok and ready for its ending  then it kind of restarts with a secondary plot  after that i was really ready for it to end when it did
Oct 28 2022,negative,the action and special effects were good but i felt the story line was predictable and the comedy lines were lacking  going to see the rock is always a treat and i dont expect to see a stellar acting job but i typically leave dc movies wondering why they cant find the same caliber of writers that marvel seems to find  i did like the first wonder woman quite a bit and feel that aquaman was good  the test of a good action movie is whether you are willing to watch it again and im not willing to spend time watching this movie again
Oct 28 2022,positive,awesome best postcredit scene ever
Oct 28 2022,positive,there was a lot of action which is something i love
Oct 28 2022,positive,if you want a nonstop actionpacked comic book movie this is it the rock made a spectacular job in making a movie for the fans the story could have been better but at the end its a must watch dont listen to these critics
Oct 28 2022,positive,my high rating for the film is a response to critics because the film is more than wonderful free from unnecessary agendas and nonsense and it is safe to watch and i personally will watch it every time with my family
Oct 28 2022,positive,its been a long time since ive seen such an entertaining movie this brutal one the rock is great
Oct 28 2022,positive,i dont know what the critics are complaining this movies was freaking amazing the action and vfx was top notch and if im gonna be honest here lol dwayne did a great job as black adam but i was here for the jsa dr fate and hawkman were amazing seeing them in live action brought tears to my eyes cyclone and atom smasher were great too all in all a very entertaining movie 910
Oct 28 2022,negative,the rock acting was child throwing fit 
Oct 28 2022,positive,love this movie so much
Oct 28 2022,positive,very good action movie
Oct 28 2022,positive,action scenes are well done dialogue not so much
Oct 28 2022,positive,great superhero movie lots of action and cool flashy cgi great introduction and story to black adams origin dont listen to the snobby critics its a superhero movie what do you expect
Oct 28 2022,positive,i was pleasantly surprised by the heart that was put into this movie also dr fate is the bomb
Oct 28 2022,positive,watched it on diwali with some old childhood friends whom i met after long years we got more than we expected went with an open mind and it was beautiful of a movie i am going to rewatch it again love the theme love the bgms love the characters love the attitude the movie presents
Oct 28 2022,positive,loved it action packed from start to finish must see
Oct 28 2022,positive,old school 90s superhero vibe from start to finish a nice change from what has become the norm especially where it comes to marvel outings dj is funny and empowering throughout a good start for the character which they can only build upon lets hope wb think about the future of dc and build from this rather than run scared when they dont get the same numbers in as marvel wb have a lot of redeeming to do and need to restart from the ground up hopefully this kickstarts and aids a soft reboot which will finally give us a new superman movie with henry cavill the man deserves to show us his own take on the granddaddy of superheroes
Oct 28 2022,positive,awesome movie one of the better dc movies
Oct 28 2022,positive,this movie was straight flames perfect characterization and fan service
Oct 28 2022,positive,great came back for dc great action scenes and great fights pro critics are really wrong this is what we as dc fans want so see we now live in a world that we can choose wha to watch thank you dwayne johnson for listening to the real and bringing back henry cavill
Oct 28 2022,positive,action pack movie very marvel like but with its own twist the rock and the entire cast was greatly
Oct 28 2022,positive,nothing special nothing new   still fun to watch solid entertainment
Oct 28 2022,positive,can watch once better than phase 4 marvel 
Oct 28 2022,positive,the critics obviously dont have clue great fun film what the movies should be about entertainment
Oct 28 2022,positive,starting out strong with the action really enjoyed the story as a person who is not well informed on the dc universe the story was easy to follow the the heroes of the justice society were cool black adams overwhelming power was fun to watch nice change to have a hero who instead of trying to be youre typical hero he is youre get it done kind of guy need more of that in movies and real life go see this movie
Oct 28 2022,negative,sorry to say that the story was weak basic formula thats been seen over and over again just another superhero movie wish they wouldve taken more risks i really had high hopes 
Oct 28 2022,positive,action if we compare origins movies well this is another one of them but its fresh and fast to watchall hater can justo go and watch she hulk
Oct 28 2022,positive,bad script good movie 
Oct 28 2022,positive,the best dc movie thats come out and dwayne johnson just makes it so much better
Oct 28 2022,negative,movie was terrible some good action but bad script and lazy writing
Oct 28 2022,positive,im a marvel girl but dc did good on this one saw it in 4dx and it made it even better
Oct 28 2022,positive,i liked so much this movie the movie is very entertaining and i enjoyed it the specials effects make the action scenes dynamic and entertaining i liked the music too but the guion has too much comedy so makes it weaker and i was waiting for something a little of bit darker but i liked
Oct 28 2022,positive,there are so many superhero movies out there already  this one is surprisingly quite enjoyable  love it
Oct 28 2022,negative,i dont know whats worse about this moviethe movie itself or the rocks constant posting of fake narratives that it changed the game  dont trust the rock he will spin anything to make it sound good
Oct 28 2022,positive,i loved the action this movie had and i loved dr fate but this moviecould haved done more in developing some of the chracters but in all i enjoyed this movie
Oct 28 2022,positive,overall fun and a good time also proof that professional critics are lost in movies today   grew up with the comic version but i dont get hung up on that yeah he may not have the accent or pointy ears but the rock fits the bill and the supporting cast is great as their characters stoked to hopefully see more of hawkman too good fun not slow and not to fast and great action scenes
Oct 28 2022,positive,when black adam was flying it was surprisingly unrealistic seems like in 2022 wed have the tech to do better
Oct 28 2022,positive,damn those paid and political critics stuff like that thats makes the future of movies doomed this movie were great and the rock brought the best of it to the table
Oct 28 2022,positive,the visual effects were amazing
Oct 28 2022,positive,black adam review minor spoilers pros the supporting cast hawkman dr fate amanda waller atom smasher cyclone and adriana are the the ones who shine in this movie dwayne johnson does a decent job of actually not playing himself for once but he is actually a pretty quiet character and doesnt really have a ton to stay hes actually about as quiet as batman which is a nice change for him the other characters however are scene stealers and honestly outshine him which doesnt bode well for the leading man fight scenes and music this film has some of the coolest fight scenes in the dceu especially between hawkman and black adam the film has some awesome shots of these characters it makes you feel like you are playing injustice pretty cool with some awesome rap and rock music definitely worth seeing as a dc fan fan service the film shows you that this definitely lives within the dceu of course i cant tell you who you see and dont see but we all know dwayne johnson regardless of how we feel about his acting delivered and promised what he felt fans were owed it was because he advocated that we got what we wanted you know what im talking about cons storytelling and location i am not familiar with the origin of black adam so i was extra confused i felt the plot and story were lacking kind of stupid the entire movie literally takes place in one spot it feels like for a movie with a bunch of people who can fly leap jump and spin they sure dont leave town the plot wasnt amazing stupid pagan spirituality involved the movie has a lot of dark magic and the villain literally is the devil ha he has horns hes red and breathes fire and has the satanic star branded on his chest from a christian perspective that is something we do not take lightly in a superhero movie someone also says out loud that it doesnt always take a white knight to defeat him the devil dumb guy but something darker while yes you can defeat the devil without being a saint anyone knows you cant defeat evil with evil it was the good in black adam obviously and not black adam alone the film had some great scenes and some stupid ones it was worth watching but may or may not be worth buying on dvd 710 
Oct 28 2022,positive,you are the hope of dc universe please continue carry dc universe at your back the rock my man you did it the rock you rock everyone and you knock at the door of the enemy now theyre shaking in fear
Oct 28 2022,positive,love it entire family enjoy it  fight scene especially with the jsa was awesome lots good talent on display right thru
Oct 28 2022,positive,overall its a great movie good fight scenes storyline is also good probably the rocks best movie so far
Oct 28 2022,negative,i think i am tired of the rock now this movie sent me over the edge plus too much kandar in the film they hardly had different locations it was so dejavu    the antihero thing is fresh hollywood and their righteous hero act is disgusting but the plot story character development was just so bad that was all they had
Oct 28 2022,positive,fun action packed black adam is an exiting comic book popcorn flick one of the best dc movies to date
Oct 28 2022,positive,its a goode movie to pass time watching it
Oct 28 2022,positive,great movie the rock was cool pierce brosnan was cool i had a great deal of fun at the movies normally i cant stand noah centineo but i could tolerate him in this movie i would like to see more of aldis hodge everyone else was okay oh and quintessa swindel was cool
Oct 28 2022,positive,if you remove the child actor  this film would be soooooooo much better  and dont let the townspeople speak  at all  then  it would be near perfect  as usual with a dc hero movie  you know people have died but you dont even hear a groan as the camera passes through a marketplace  at least this time  we see people have died but it doesnt seem to phase anyone  hero or civilian    i can forgive all that because the rest of the film is strong enough for me to have enjoyed the film and to want a sequel  especially with superman  wishing the hawklike character whose only talent appears to be having a bad attitude would have been plucked off screen but alas  maybe well get lucky  ala ironman  and have him replaced with someone who is more of a human being and can act
Oct 28 2022,positive,very entertaining good acting go see it
Oct 28 2022,positive,great movie i really like that best of the year
Oct 28 2022,positive,it was more then i expected i loved hackman and the jsa
Oct 28 2022,positive,so cool much better than boring thor love and thunder
Oct 28 2022,positive,amazing movie they really went above and beyond the rock does care about what the fans want also amazing to see doctor faith in action 
Oct 28 2022,positive,dc teaching marvel how to make a hero movie pseudo or antihero whatever  now that dc seems to have come to its senses again and we hope that marvel has it back hopefully we can get back to having fun with concepts from hero movies and others as they are not like identity agendas try to force useless messages forgetting quality of the work
Oct 28 2022,positive,a thrill ride from start to finish with exciting action scenes and many humorous moments sprinkled in amongst the super hero moments go see it for yourself
Oct 28 2022,positive,this movie rocked a movie made for dc fans instead of wasting time on back stories for the supporting cast we get just the right amount of time to explain who they are and what they can do but very much fully developed characters that were ready to be placed straight into the mix the cgi looked great especially in black adams opening scenes low key hats off to how well this film did their world building giving us a back drop the likes never seen before    the rock and supporting cast did a wonderful job giving us likeable and interesting characters to watch mixed with a balanced amount of humour that allows the film not to take itself to seriously while being entertaining hope wb keeps giving us more of this dceu rather than the reboot rubbish the likes of robert pattinsons batman
Oct 28 2022,positive,excellent  lots of action some dry humour and post credit scene
Oct 28 2022,positive,great movie so many new actors flanking a couple of great ones with great acting  story line and powerful sound effects you cant go wrong sitting on the edge of your seat in anticipation of what was to come next good a must see this fall enjoy
Oct 28 2022,neutral,not bad but could be much better there is no message just pure comic book fun  which is rare in 2022 dc is heading in a right direction
Oct 28 2022,positive,everything was good post credits were bomb too
Oct 28 2022,positive,one of the best movies of dc top 3 easily action packed good fights good story once again shows that the critics dont know what they are saying
Oct 28 2022,positive,entertaining movie good visuals and action sequences good introduction to the character its pg13 due to the violence so it is not recommended for young children theres hope for the dc comics extended universe
Oct 28 2022,positive,it has all the staples of a good superhero movie and it had more depth than most marvel movies with character losses that made you feel for them also loved the reference to the good the bad and the ugly
Oct 28 2022,negative,3 people in the theater i was the last to walk out i lasted about 45 minutes before i couldnt tolerate this dung pile any longer
Oct 28 2022,positive,absolutely epic i have no idea what these so called movie critics watched the way black adam behaved was extremely accurate to the character and everything in the movie makes sense the rock definitely did his homework thumbs way up
Oct 28 2022,positive,movie was amazing and a must watch and of course professional trolls literally suck and doesnt know tf their tastes are these days
Oct 28 2022,positive,many people will call this movie dumb that it is a fun action movie with every generic trope there is and they would be right this is a dumb movie but at the same time it has something very interesting to say about the morality of interventionism and the hypocrisy of the international order of things its critique of super heroes generally and how they ignore the mundane evils of the world is a fascinating dilemma one which the movie is in constant dialogue with that is the heart of the movie its painted over with some of the most tired and overused genre beats of super hero cinema its sandwiched between the clunkiest of exposition and capped with a laughably prosaic finale it even has a sky beam hahaha  there is a fascinating movie in here that makes it easy for me to forgive its many flaws at the very least its still fun even at its worse its filled with excellently shot action sequences and incredibly entertaining fights despite it all i really did enjoy this one and am excited to see where the story goes from here
Oct 28 2022,negative,boring after an hour heavy action with bad music and story is bad
Oct 28 2022,negative,very poor selection of actors bad directing bad script and the jokes in the movie are very old
Oct 28 2022,positive,thats what i call a comic book movie
Oct 28 2022,positive,sooooooooo good great fight scenes great backstorycharacter development great unforced humor absolutely worth the watch and i will be watching this again for sure
Oct 28 2022,positive,dont get me wrong i like dwayne johnson but i am getting tired of seeing him on every movie thats been coming out its time to give someone else a chance lol
Oct 28 2022,positive,i like that he was a bad good guy yes we need a sequel
Oct 28 2022,positive,good storyline action scene and build up well done
Oct 28 2022,positive,i think he played the pet of black adam just perfect  it was all action loved it

Oct 28 2022,positive,greatest movie ive seen in a long time
Oct 28 2022,positive,one of dc best movies in a while and in some ways unapologetic starting to really side eye the review from critics its clear theyre a biased and not trying to hide it anymore some of the reviews from the professional critic side is nonsense many of the same people hated this but loved she hulk smh    give it a watch for yourself dont take it too seriously very enjoyable watch
Oct 28 2022,positive,what a great action packed movie one of the rocks best films for sure dont listen to the bias film critics who are trashing the film its funny theyll praise a marvel film and bash a dc film dont believe me go look at the history of both marvel and dc youll find im right

Oct 28 2022,negative,it was just ok rock did fantastic  i enjoyed his personality and facial expressions he was believable the hawk character was annoying and seemed to be on 1 mode
Oct 28 2022,positive,great movie good action scenes good characters just the right amount of humor and even a few winks for the audience really fun
Oct 28 2022,positive,i liked it  im glad i went to see it  just a standard movie for another superhero  lots of action  lots of new heroes added into the dc universe  i look forward to another black adam movie
Oct 28 2022,positive,i did it for the rock

Oct 28 2022,positive,its what it is a fun movie  of course it has his flaws just like every other movie in human history ive enjoyed almost every minute
Oct 28 2022,negative,another disney tier and marvel stylized movie
Oct 28 2022,positive,i realy enjoyed the film enjoyed a lot this version of antiheroe and the square version of law in third workd countrys we are tires that law only is good for people in charge black adam is the antiheroe we need
Oct 28 2022,positive,a dc movie through and through will certainly see again in theaters before streaming it
Oct 28 2022,positive,my expectations werent very high that said i was incredibly happy with this movie its genuinely very enjoyable and fun it doesnt talk down to the audience and is what it is  need more just fun entertaining action movies
Oct 28 2022,positive,great action packed great pacing great acting the three main components you will see and experience in the first 30 minutes of this film im absolutely relieved of all the traumatizing horrible marvel films this year but im glad this was the one to cleanse me of the rubbish every character here has theyre distinct feel and connection to you the rock was amazing and dr fate stole every scene he was in great film
Oct 28 2022,positive,entertaining movie pierce brosnan is amazing as doctor fate
Oct 28 2022,positive,dwayne johnson as a super hero rocks see what i did there

Oct 28 2022,positive,we really enjoyed dwayne johnson as black adam lots of action and special effects
Oct 28 2022,negative,oh mywhere to begin mr johnsons acting was awful his wwf days produced more believable dialog and emotion yet another movie ruined by his terrible acting and lack of personality on screen the chemistry between characters was non existent and all around everything was brought down by his performance the cgi was decent but it was pretty bad on the level of the black panther and wakanda forever cgi what could have been
Oct 28 2022,positive,great movie unlike all other dc movies had good laughs even more action and great graphics with bloody scenes
Oct 28 2022,positive,stunning visuals great action scenes and new hopes for the dc universe what a refreshing experience the rock and pierce brosnan stand out but seen that the justice society is now a thing is just amazing
Oct 28 2022,positive,great action as the rock does great story a great dc movie dc is not marvel dc is a much darker universe will see again for sure mid credit scene is a must see after that no more scenes so leave lolthey couldnt have picked a better black adam especially going forward to mix into the dcu
Oct 28 2022,positive,great simple and fun film the plot was lacking
Oct 28 2022,positive,the action was top tier we got to see dwayne johnson and not the rock act and bring a different perspective into the anti hero universe
Oct 28 2022,neutral,75 of this movie is pretty goodok 25 is terrible ditch the corny lines and villains make a movie thats about more than the action dc needs to figure out if they want to make good movies or movies that pay the bills
Oct 28 2022,positive,good movie it didnt feel like 2 hours alots of action
Oct 28 2022,positive,not the greatest superhero movie ever but it still better than the last several marvel offerings the backstory is a bit light but thats not really what im looking for in a movie like this wall to wall action is the name of this game
Oct 28 2022,positive,as a superhero movie it provided the action  and charm youd expect but it also provided an intriguing storyline im excited for this next phase of dc
Oct 28 2022,positive,the movie was great and very true to how he would had been portrayed in the comics  cant wait to see what happened to dr fate
Oct 28 2022,positive,nonstop action with a great story

Oct 28 2022,neutral,wellthat was interesting
Oct 28 2022,positive,it was a pretty good movie  i mean of course it was not perfect the script could have been better  there were some cheesy lines etc but everything else was pretty good i liked the fact that it was very  fast paced  great action scenes  very good visuals  and surprisingly very good background score definitely worth watching  end credit scene was dope as well
Oct 28 2022,positive,i went in with little few expectations but man dwayne johnson did a spectacular job
Oct 28 2022,positive,dont be told what to think about the movie by the critics go watch this film and have a good time
Oct 27 2022,negative,its the rock in a costume doing typical superhero movie stuff  only decent parts were jsa stuff
Oct 27 2022,positive,finally showing heros with human qualities must see
Oct 27 2022,positive,i really enjoyed the movie
Oct 27 2022,positive,well worth seeing lots of twists and turns be sure to stay for the closing credits for a surprise very entertaining
Oct 27 2022,positive,good action movie but a little obvious sometimes if you want action without too much thinking it is your movie  if you want a good scenario with a perfect storyline and timing you might be a bit disappointed
Oct 27 2022,positive,love the action the actors the origin of the story kept me wanting to see more  just a good movie for me
Oct 27 2022,positive,its good not great
Oct 27 2022,positive,really great dc movie the majority of the movie was kept serious marvel movies to me have always made everything to a damn joke serious fighting someone lays down a joke unrealistic i like the fact that dc does not do that 
Oct 27 2022,positive,the story was okay good enough to move the movie along its path the action was great and the comedy was also great minus a few corny moments i didnt like in the end i would definitely go see this one again which isnt something i would do often for most movies lately
Oct 27 2022,positive,a lot of action loved it
Oct 27 2022,positive,it was funny and had great action  even some laughs  surprisingly fun

Oct 27 2022,positive,very entertaining watch no regrets i came for dwayne johnson and stayed for the aftercredits very pleased
Oct 27 2022,positive,if they included some real gore i would have loved it even more    overall very refreshing with amazing action
Oct 27 2022,positive,must watch dwayne johnson kill people
Oct 27 2022,negative,great set and cinematography  let down by poor dialogues and amateur acting
Oct 27 2022,positive,very very good popcorn movie pity the marvel paid critics didnt like it but my lot had a lot of fun was very impressed with the hawkman and dr fate cameos they wernt there for tokenism and added to the story
Oct 27 2022,positive,pretty much everything youd expect the only issue is that black adam is never depicted as a true villain he is constantly straddling the line of heroantiherovillain but never standing firmly on the ground of one of those categories i can only assume the reason of this and my assumption is that dj is so focused on having a positive image that he simply had no desire to go full villain pretty generic super hero premisestory which is refreshing when youve got marvel constantly trying to dip their toe into new flavors of super hero movies they prioritized the action of the movie while leaving the storyline somewhat hollow the reason it works is because the action is so damn good that the faults in the plot are easily dismissed the slowmo scenes are a little overbearing but still entertaining seeing a hero just indiscriminately kill people is refreshing that aspect is reminiscent of deadpool but without the humor dwayne is fucking massive in this movie too its not exactly an accurate depiction of tethadam but he makes it work really well when you see him towering over dr fate and hawkman it really emphasizes that this man has the power of a god and that he isnt afraid to use it they pretty much ripped off the premise of t2 judgment day with the hero protecting the kid and the mom but they made it work kudos to dc this is a step in the right direction
Oct 27 2022,positive,awesome perfect wonderfully i have no words to describe the movie its the movie of the year thank you so much the rock
Oct 27 2022,positive,this was so exciting to watch
Oct 27 2022,positive,the movie was a solid effort better than just about everything since spiderman no way home the child actor left something to be desired but overall it was worth the price of admission more than i can say for some recent fare looking forward to seeing the rock reprise the role
Oct 27 2022,positive,movie was pretty good overall the rock will never win an oscar but does a good job  i enjoyed it and recommend going to see it
Oct 27 2022,positive,i liked a lot of how the action scenes were done and a lot of good fights scenes also a couple funny moments sprinkled in issues were the classic cliches but overall not a bad movie
Oct 27 2022,positive,good action little darker than most superhero movies but as expected from dc was  a little different than most in a good way
Oct 27 2022,positive,beautiful well made film well produced great special effects good acting and lots of action
Oct 27 2022,positive,i just watched the movie today and it was by far the best ive seen in the past 3 years and i may be biased because as an iranian the movie was even more enjoyable freeing the people of that country from tyranny felt very relatable the people of that country fighting with the skeletons felt very similar to the iran protesting videos ive seen in the past month though i would suspect this was done on purpose  considering the shops had persian words on them the main actress in the movie was an iranian actress in addition to the timing of the release of this movie and the fact that their country used to have a monarchy they did a good job on not showing anything islamic so that they wouldnt go down for islamophobic even if that was not their intention to show the movie like this with the demon being the dictator the movie itself was 910 the cgi was perfect fight scenes perfect loved the sound track acting and barely any cringe comedy finally a movie worth the ticket i paid for ill definitely buy the blu ray upon release to rewatch it ive watched thousands of movies and yes i like stupid generic action my favourite movie of all time was the avengers but this just outdid it for me probably biased though
Oct 27 2022,negative,its like dc are in a rush to make a terrible movie the only way this film made any sense was becasue it rested on implicit comparison with marvel and an implied character development dc havent actually provided  just knockoff dr strange knockof falcon knockoff antman knockoff storm etc
Oct 27 2022,positive,very interesting movie and it kept our attention the whole time
Oct 27 2022,positive,dont listen to the reviews
Oct 27 2022,positive,despite the mediocre reviews i enjoyed black adam for its mix of camp and action as well bringing a suicide squad type hero with superman level powers into the mix the film itself is not groundbreaking and its actually the supporting characters rather than black adam who steal the show dwayne johnson as the titular character isnt much different than what he normally portrays but its good to see him in a darker role
Oct 27 2022,positive,love the moviethere was nothing i did not like
Oct 27 2022,positive,the best film of the year  comic book fans will love it
Oct 27 2022,positive,im not the biggest fan of the rock but this movie was a solid 8 out of 10 for me best dc movie in a while
Oct 27 2022,positive,great action sequences  weak on the story front though
Oct 27 2022,positive,black adam was a very fun movie very happy to see other superheros as well
Oct 27 2022,positive,great movie love end credits cameo
Oct 27 2022,positive,better than what i expected visual effects were above average plot was seamless had a couple cheesy moments otherwise would have been a 55 for me im a marvel fan
Oct 27 2022,positive,when you realize that the criticism of experts has no credibility at all
Oct 27 2022,positive,screw the critics  audience tell the truth it was refreshing and entertaining best dc movie ive seen in a while
Oct 27 2022,positive,the rock was excellent as the character
Oct 27 2022,positive,movie made for fans not critics congratulations dc
Oct 27 2022,positive,very  fun to watch  nice costumes  leading rock
Oct 27 2022,positive,pretty action packed  i like have a bad guy wish he was more bad  heres a break down and i am not sure why dc cant get this right  the idea of the movie was ok  not sure if dc was just trying to enter more characters into the universe but besides hawkman and dr strange i mean fate the other two were there for no reason  i was glad there wasnt a forced love story but the plot got scrambled up  intergang wasnt evolved enough  a good story takes a better bad guy  the bad guy sucked the end fight scene was dumb especially with the sacrifice of    it just was thrown together and was about the action  its a mindless movie to take away a couple hours  way better than love and thunder though
Oct 27 2022,positive,i realy liked the movie must see
Oct 27 2022,positive,need snyderverse with black adadm n part 2
Oct 27 2022,positive,really entertaining  nothing mindblowing but a lot of fun especially dr fate  i would rate this a 3 but lately focusing on the fans and being fun is something rare so it gets a 45
Oct 27 2022,positive,one of the dceus weakest films since 2016s suicide squad i liked ww84 blow me black adam isnt terrible the actings good the visual effects are mostly great i laughed a few times and i do like the opening action sequence which felt like a horror movie pierce brosnans dr fate is the best part of this entire film where it falls flat is in how the pacing was far too fast for my liking the villain sucks it doesnt dwell as deep as it shouldve regarding antihero ethics and the action pretty much peaked when they started playing paint it black the rest of the action isnt awful but it feels underwhelming also the iconic shazam villain is kept out of focus in his own movie to make room for the justice society whom were expected to just accept them as having always been in the dceu and the tiein comics dont explain that they were formed in the wake of the justice league defeating steppenwolf or anything like that if thats what you were wondering the movie wouldve been better off being titled black adam and the justice society maybe warner bros feared such a title would lead to another birds of prey fiasco i cant bring myself to hate this movie largely because i appreciate that after 15 years the rocks wish of playing this comic book character finally came true and am understanding that with the critical acclaim of the suicide squad and the batman some tough act to follow reactions are to be expected but i sadly came out of this wishing that i saw super pets instead it had a temporary rerelease where i live
Oct 27 2022,negative,simplistic story with many unnecessary branchs sid the story fights that could have been amazing were slowed down too many times justice society was amazing but felt like it was a poor way to add them to the universe the dcu is disjointed and nothing is being setup which is why they are making changes it was an okay movie but stop over hyping it hold the industry to better standards of storytellingwriting
Oct 27 2022,positive,that was an awesome movie  and the post credit scene boss level win
Oct 27 2022,positive,fantastic movie it felt fresh and original yet it also seemed very classic easily the best dc movie yet though really that isnt saying much in and of itself truly wonderful thanks for the great entertainment dtrj
Oct 27 2022,negative,after about the 50th time i saw the trailer i still kept saying why just why this is yet another typical hollywood cgi laden movie with no story character arc or purpose in other words  why well money is my usual answer anytime i ask that question and seeing it made 110 million last weekend i kinda have my answer i am glad to see others feeling the same way about this piece of garbage as i do the upside is i didnt have to pay 15 to see it for those who do save your money and buy a book
Oct 27 2022,positive,movie was great love the cgi and vfx used it was all about action from start to the end
Oct 27 2022,positive,nothing i didnt like what an entrance and epic story   love to see more total glad i went to the cinema to watch it
Oct 27 2022,positive,pretty good for a dc movie 
Oct 27 2022,positive,it was exciting and kept our interest
Oct 27 2022,positive,black adam is a very well made movie from its script the setting the characters very well treated and adapted and if we compare it with the rest of superhero productions it is one of the best unfortunately some critics have qualified it from their personal desire  critics that when seeing their profiles really shouldnt be too biased and rightly so its a good movie within the superhero genre  many critics are but thanks to these other rotten t it is no longer reliable to have a review and the world already sees it that way
Oct 27 2022,positive,this movie overall was incredible the visuals fight scenes music all were great dwaynes performance was great exceeded my expectations by a lot dr fate and hawkman as characters were great as well all the others however didnt really live up to them they werent awful by any means just not as good as the main 3 the kid sorry i dont remember his name throughout the movie never sounded like a kid he was way better spoken and sounded more like an adult though most of it thats my only complaint to be honest overall 9710
Oct 27 2022,positive,incredibly fun not the best story or acting if they removed the young kid the movie would be much better honestly but cant say this enough its soooo fun
Oct 27 2022,positive,this movie was utterly phenomenal  massively entertaining
Oct 27 2022,positive,best dc movie ive seen so far
Oct 27 2022,positive,great dc movie worth the wait cant wait to see it again
Oct 27 2022,negative,i came away feeling that a meh so what couple of hours had just been wasted the only character who meant anything was skateboard boy the justice crew were judgemental and unpleasantly single and closed minded dwayne johnsons dialog was unenlivened by any hint of humour apart from a couple of plays on sarcasm  leaving him stony faced and ponderously pacing whenever he wasnt crucifying his opponents with lightning or flying off into the next melee   oh yes and dont go for the 4dx cinema experience i was praying for the movie to end before my neck suffered terminal whiplash it was an exercise in endurance   i have been to many 4dx movies my best experience was the latest mission impossible movie as tom cruise battled with a crashing helicopter sliding down a snow covered slope   the worst every fight scene in black adam where violent motion was substituted for subtlety and finesse as if all of the guard rails had been removed in the battle to create the mostest 4dx experience   sadly for me just like dreadful 3d movies that broke occular laws destroyed what should have been a lucrative premium 3d cinema experience after the first avatar movie opened the door so this experience has slammed the door shut on contrived dc movies  and 4dx to boot
Oct 27 2022,positive,this movie was a lot of fun it had some superhero troupes that have been overdone but the action was fresh and exciting the supporting cast and characters were great solid b
Oct 27 2022,negative,was not a fan of the devilish imagery with one of the characters  i feel that if it wasnt for dwayne johnson being in the movie it wouldnt have been tolerable
Oct 27 2022,positive,i went in with low expectations after hearing the critics reviews but about half way through the movie was wondering if i was watching the same one they did  i thought it was great  it had the right amount of everything  badass action scenes check  lol moments check  engaging plot check  interesting new characters check  whats not to like
Oct 27 2022,positive,good movie compelling story a little too heavy on the cgi tho
Oct 27 2022,positive,better then i thought it would be great story didnt want it to end
Oct 27 2022,positive,i really enjoyed that i hope dc keeps this up
Oct 27 2022,positive,it was an amazing theatrical experience the vfx and cgi were out of this world this movie really captures the potential of every character and the battles were extremely epic i wish they worked on the plot and the dialogues a bit more but overall it was one of a kind fun experience
Oct 27 2022,negative,if you genuinely like this movie i have zero trust in your movie taste 
Oct 27 2022,positive,any comic book fan that actually knows comics would see that this movie was portrayed pretty well black adam was imprisoned for 5000 years fighting a hardcore battle for freedom comes back in todays society not know what is going on with the exact same mentality with no time to really adjust dwayne the rock johnson puts the nail on the head by acting out violently and not being made into a slave and making you see that he is an antihero     the action sequence scenes are a perfect dose of testosterone fueled mayhem with of course a few minor one liners to add a chuckle or two     i think audiences could really relate with how black adam feels about life and acts the way he does once the plot twist is revealed     i personally loved the film i think dj did the character justice and was definitely what the dc universe needed
Oct 27 2022,positive,just the rock in a amazing movie
Oct 27 2022,positive,this film delivers exactly what id say ant and expect decent story no oscars to be won but non stop action and outstanding characters  especially pierce brosnan anyone scoring down this film went in with the wring expectations simple
Oct 27 2022,positive,entertaining from start to finish one of the most action packed hero films ive ever seen
Oct 27 2022,positive,best dc movie of all the rock is perfect fort the part and brosnan too marvel should just learn no other words needed
Oct 27 2022,negative,bad writing bad acting trying to do one liners like marvel great action scenes 
Oct 27 2022,positive,kept moving at a good pace with still getting a good background on what and why things are happening
Oct 27 2022,positive,one of my favorite characters shazamblack adam compine with the rock of course i was excited about this movie i was expecting something more of it
Oct 27 2022,negative,a lot of production value so thats cool but the whole premise and story line leave a lot to be desired also gives the feel of taking ideas from marvel knock off black panther random comedic relief good old school tracks not to say this is bad but theres nothing unique about the black adam film still go watch it looks like they put a lot of effort into this
Oct 27 2022,positive,great movie  didnt expect to like it this much
Oct 27 2022,positive,liked it very much overall speaking of only the black adam he stole the hearts of many and the show as well
Oct 27 2022,positive,a lot of action some funny moments but i liked the story and what is going to lead up to others movies with black adam
Oct 27 2022,positive,black adam was surprisingly good i went in with low expectations but both the movie and the rock surprised me the rock isnt the best actor in the world but he did a good job portraying black adam the writing pacing dialogue and humor in the movie was also good the other characters in the movie were all wellwritten and portrayed well as well also inclusion of the justice society made the story way more entertaining and enjoyable im happy to see the rock finally have a huge hit like this and i hope he continues in this role to have more success he deserves it
Oct 27 2022,negative,i would have liked this movie more if it wasnt for the blatant woke casting  i am all for diversity but they made hawkman into a black guy  i am all done with these super hero movies until they can scale that bs back some
Oct 27 2022,positive,you gotta commend dc a little for their ability to pivot and focus on what has worked in the past it doesnt necessarily mean the movies will be good per se but at least it feels like theyre on their way to a formula that might actually consistently work this was my impression of black adam its essentially a spinoffcrossover of ideas from shazam and the suicide squad two of dcs most recent successes    this movie actually has a pretty good theme especially when it comes to its takes on colonialism and imperialism it has some interesting things to say about the us military liberating middle eastern countries though the themes could have been explored much deeper    what the movie lacks is consistent tone it tries to have the quirky funny quippy mood of shazam and the suicide squad but it also feels like it wants to be dark and edgy and why you would cast the rock for an edgy role i cant begin to speculate it doesnt do either of these very well so it ends up somewhat unsatisfying it also introduces a lot of characters weve never met before and none of them get as much screen time or backstory as they should have    also i know dc has a rich history of comic book heroes that have been around for a long time but its legitimately distracting how many of these characters feel exactly the same as recent mcu characters weve seen doctor fate atom smasher hawk man these feel like cheap ripoffs even if theyre not intended to be    its messy and unpolished but pretty entertaining with a few good ideas to back it up far from dcs worst this is a good one for popcorn munching and not thinking too much about what youre watching and stick around for the midcredits scene which has some continuityconfirming goodness
Oct 27 2022,positive,i enjoyed the movie from start to finish dwayne the rock johnson does a fantastic job portraying black adam and im looking forward to movies to come with black adam in it 5 stars
Oct 27 2022,positive,great film go with the audience score critics are  clueless
Oct 27 2022,positive,rotten tomatoes always quick to do everything they can when they woke movie is getting a bad rating lets see if they do anything about the fact that critics hate movies that dont have work agenda in it with that being  said id give it 710 its really just an action movie with alot of fighting
Oct 27 2022,positive,it was pretty good definitely plenty of action i think they missed on a few back story opportunities though there was never any indication that hawkman is any older than he looks when in fact he keeps getting reborn to find his wife who is hawkgirl
Oct 27 2022,positive,awesome just awesome those critics should criticize themselves for giving this movie a low score
Oct 27 2022,positive,the movie was great and delivered what you would expect from a film like this not all films have to be some profound piece of cinema or push an agenda  for me its nice to see a film that lets you get away and escape nagging real world issues because of that best film of the year for me
Oct 27 2022,positive,the movie is great its undertoned with a little light for an antihero brings the dark side of the real dc comics understandable pure action although its fast pace it gives an indepth feel of the protagonist power since dc cinematics have been slow bringing out movies i understand they wanted to make many easter egg of what is to come which im excited for since dc is more realistic than marvel rate 4 star but adding 1 star for what i expect for the next this is a good start for the revival of dc cinematics
Oct 27 2022,positive,one of the best dc movies ive ever seen
Oct 27 2022,positive,it was a classic superhero movie there were moments at times t you would hear cheap cliché but the action and dwayne johnson portrayal was just impressive and im looking forward to the next adventure for the dc universe
Oct 27 2022,positive,i loved the movie i always liked dc better because of their darkermore violent ways of movies more realistic to me   i just wish the movie wouldve stayed rated r but maybe later  hopefully new management will pay off
Oct 27 2022,positive,a bit cheesy but amazingly action packed
Oct 27 2022,positive,the movie is quite entertaining the rock is amazing as black adam theres a lot of action and that was what i sign up for critics are no fans they hate the movie for free the movie was made for fans do not expect to watch something worth an oscar or the dark knight trilogy its just a superheroantihero movie with a lot of action scenes as it suppose to be the cgi is on point also
Oct 27 2022,positive,the movie was amazing especially the actors i select the production and how they acted it doesnt have bad effects like other superhero movies the truth would see it again and i think it is a great start to the dc universe the critics do not know or will know the good perfection does not exist and will not exist 
Oct 27 2022,positive,black adam movie is the best
Oct 27 2022,positive,black adam was an amazing experience as a comic book superhero geek i thoroughly enjoyed this movie
Oct 27 2022,negative,they missed big here they could have leaned into the rocks poor acting by making him not able to speak the language or know the customs of modern civilization wanted more shazam lightheartedness and got lightturdedness
Oct 27 2022,positive,i loved it glad to see dc coming up to par with marvel movies
Oct 27 2022,positive,action action and more action thats all i can say
Oct 27 2022,positive,it was great
Oct 27 2022,positive,i feel this movie brings what alot of people have been wanting to see for a long time more action with a decent story line and a super hero that doesnt take prisoners
Oct 27 2022,positive,overall very entertaining movie theres no surprises the movie is very predictable but its still good enough for what it is
Oct 27 2022,positive,great fun time at the movies the rock is perfect in the role this is a passion project of his and you can tell
Oct 27 2022,positive,critics once again have no idea what they are talking about great movie and i usually hate dc movies
Oct 27 2022,positive,really enjoyable far superior to thor love and thunder
Oct 27 2022,positive,the beggining of dc the end of marvel
Oct 27 2022,positive,love it great action  fun but not too fun
Oct 27 2022,positive,typical rock action film with all the thrills and chills
Oct 27 2022,positive,this was a great movie  worth all the years of waiting
Oct 27 2022,positive,incredibly entertaining super hero movie for a change the rock still isnt accurate enough to be a believable black adam hes still a little nice for the interpretation of the role  pierce brosnan absolutely kills it as dr fate i hope they bring him back its nice to see a lesser known hero like atom smasher being used while the movie still does have a few woke issues but the overall quality of the material is very entertaining dont worry about some plot holes its a movie i liked man of steel very much despite the few plot holes which i think people over reacted to highly recommended go and watch
Oct 27 2022,positive,very very very cool no need to say that the movie is well carried by the always charming and even here comical dwayne johnson the other actors including pierce are mere decorations but what makes this movie really great are the top of the art visual effects in fact i would say that among all the action movies of the dc and marvel universe this was visually the most impressive and most perfect since thor ragnarok ill definitely watch this one again very soon 810 points
Oct 27 2022,positive,if you are expecting academy award lever story or acting then this movie is not for you it was a very fun movie and as long as you keep expectations low youll have fun with it 
Oct 27 2022,positive,much better than expected i had fun watching this for sure
Oct 27 2022,positive,it is better than i expected definitely better than wonder women and  jurassic park in my humble opinion the rock is a dark hero and i like it better than all those white hero
Oct 27 2022,positive,great movie one of the best character intros ive ever seen
Oct 27 2022,positive,movie is op have experience it in theaters only to believe mebgm is nxt lvl it feels like no cgi is used in movieoutstanding work from dceu and the rockexclusively made for theaters
Oct 27 2022,neutral,the film fails to pick its moments on when to be serious and when to be comedic while its overly entertaining with nonstop action anything else outside of the action seems to be a total distraction to the film there is no denying the stars shined as expected even if it means they would outshine others in their scenes yikes
Oct 27 2022,positive,its an entertaining and enjoyable movie experience in theaters great action and it was fun throughout never felt bored at any point in the movie if this was 2006 where we all didnt expect deep life changing super hero movies rather just entertaining blockbusters then this would fit the bill also im sure if marveldisney produced this instead of wbdc the critics wouldve been much more favorable bottom line def worth seeing in theaters for a fun experience
Oct 27 2022,positive,so much action superman is back
Oct 27 2022,positive,i honestly loved it   it was fun fresh and the rock and mr bond made it fun to watch  126 minutes of pure joy i would watch it again any time
Oct 27 2022,positive,loved the movieit had a very different vibe from other dc moviesand black adam as the character is now one of my favoritesthanks to the rock for doing such a great workenjoyed my time watching it 
Oct 27 2022,positive,great movie and worth the wait honestly shocked by critics criticism and it kinda seems like theyre getting paid for negative reviews for dc movies
Oct 27 2022,positive,thanks the rock   a fun and entertaining movie  the rock brings us a lot of content and a future plan for our beloved dc
Oct 27 2022,positive,entertainment at its finest this is that grab the pop corn and soda its a fu nmovie to watch and thats it you want a high performance drama go watch something else
Oct 27 2022,positive,what  critics gave it 40  this movie was awesome  finally a movie thats not so freakin pc that it wants to make you vomit  the story kept you guessing lots of action and it felt like something was really on the line the whole time without taking itself too seriouslyif that makes sense watch it and enjoyscrew the critics
Oct 27 2022,positive,great movie some details  but god  the rock knows whats hes doing
Oct 27 2022,positive,the rock best movie yet good representation of black adam great storyline origins and the movie itself is fun to watch the buildup to the next movie is going to be even more amazing the black adam vs superman vs shazam  i am glad finally an actor who actually listens to their fans to make an amazing movie i know many fans in hawaii is very thrilled of seeing such a good movie before the end of the year
Oct 27 2022,positive,it is a sure movie of the year those who dont like check out marvel  she hulk or love and thunder then come back here then judge this movie rt go hll
Oct 27 2022,positive,great movie the rock was awesome would recommend this movie
Oct 27 2022,positive,i liked black adams attitude throughout the whole movie and the portrayal of his powers were awesome alongside his costars loved the story personally
Oct 27 2022,negative,fun to see new characters but everything was introduced with little backstory and there was far too much corniness to take the film seriously
Oct 27 2022,positive,thank you dwayne johnson you deserve all the accolades for this one love every minute of it
Oct 27 2022,positive,this movie combines jokes and action making one of dc best films
Oct 27 2022,negative,if i had known it was going to be suicide squadshazamevery marvel moviei wouldnt have gone lol also the cgi was terrible
Oct 27 2022,neutral,meh sums it up definitely thought i would like it more than i actually did  i had a hard time connecting to any of the characters  the justice league was completely ineffective and useless  dwayne johnson physically fit the role perfectly but i missed his usual humor and animated acting as usual they could have cut out half an hour of breaking buildings and changing locations and i would have enjoyed it more
Oct 27 2022,positive,i had a blast sure its not the deepest thing weve gotten this year but not only are the characters enjoyable but the action is awesome and you really get to care about this world the more its explained   it was fun seeing it in theaters this is definitely one not to pay attention to the critics on my only complaint is i wish there was more  also the fact that it was better than thor love and thunder i seriously cannot believe i am saying this
Oct 27 2022,positive,best movie of superhero ever  this movie revived cinema  also marvel sucks
Oct 27 2022,positive,we were in need of a superhero movie that really respected the characters and the rock did it a film that respects the heroes action from start to finish without worrying about sealing highlight for doctor fate who was sensational and with a post credit that alone is worth the ticket amazing
Oct 27 2022,positive,i knew id like it when the critics didnt the same folks that tried to convince me that captain marvel birds of prey and love and thunder were good it reminded me a lot of ragnorak the story was not convoluted the jokes landed sometimes  it deals with the question if heroes really existed wouldnt they be different have different ideas of what  justice is you know just like everyday people do or would everyone just go along with what superman says i guess this film just wasnt  woke enough they race swapped hawkman but i guess thats not good enough anymore  btw hawkman is pretty cool if only they had a non binary trans pregnant man  if theyd done that then the critic score would be about 90 now  film had some flaws no doubt they all do
Oct 27 2022,negative,this movie must hiring ppl to make 5 star reviews cause this movie is the worst ive ever seen 
Oct 27 2022,positive,definitely worth watching btw everyone should ignore those trolling criticsreviews
Oct 27 2022,positive,great action shown at a breakneck pace it works in the movies favor for the majority of its runtime but hinders it at some points not much depth but an extremely fun popcorn flick with a few surprisingly heartfelt moments
Oct 27 2022,positive,this is a fun superhero movie with lots of great action and a touching family story at its core dwayne johnson is the perfect casting choice for black adam and all the supporting actors particularly peirce brosnan are fantastic in their roles this movie will entertain and keep you wanting more
Oct 27 2022,positive,the best superherp movie 2022
Oct 27 2022,positive,this movie is the best one ever and it is a much watch the storyline is smashing and acting is on fire
Oct 27 2022,positive,it was a good movie albeit it was a little cheesy bit an entertaining movie if you just shut youre critical think part of youre brain down and just enjoy
Oct 27 2022,positive,this is a movie blackadamsweep
Oct 27 2022,neutral,a very fun but bad movie worth seeing
Oct 27 2022,positive,black adam was very tough and no nonsense great movie to go see
Oct 27 2022,positive,full of action very good development and the actors and interpretations 1010
Oct 27 2022,positive,great reset of the dceu
Oct 27 2022,positive,the 4dx theater was awful it threw me around so much i spent the whole movie struggling to keep myself in the seat seatbelts please
Oct 27 2022,positive,this movie is absolutely amazing something so incredible to feel and you know that dc is better than anyone the new age is coming and the critics are so irrelevant
Oct 27 2022,positive,the movie did well to explain the darkness in black adam  what parent would not seek revenge or justice on a family killing also showing the hypocrisy of those who have so called authority but choose not to act  the justice society letting khandar be occupied is such an hypocrisy
Oct 27 2022,negative,omg was this meh  the script was terrible  the dialogue was so expositional  they tried so hard to create banter and chemistry  on screen that at times the actors clearly didnt believe it   no idea why people are rating this movie so high
Oct 27 2022,positive,dceu is back  loved the whole justice society
Oct 27 2022,positive,its beautiful doctor fate 1010
Oct 27 2022,positive,black adam 2022 is awesome dont listen to critics
Oct 27 2022,positive,spoier aheadmovie was absolute fantastic hats off to the rock for the superman henry cavil cameo  i hope the rock changes the dcu future
Oct 27 2022,positive,best movie ive seen in theater in long time definitely worth it the rock dj always delivers so excited about future of dceu marvel is so lame now 
Oct 27 2022,positive,really liked this movie glad i didnt follow the critics advice
Oct 27 2022,positive,its a superhero movie i had a great time and enjoyed the rock as always
Oct 27 2022,positive,its the great one that the main storyline is about fighting as it should be for the superhero movie not dramatic at all i appreciate it 
Oct 27 2022,positive,a reprieve for the dceu the end credits scene says it all 
Oct 27 2022,positive,this was an entertaining and fun superantihero flick  it was simple and campy and it didnt fall on its face or purposefully antagonize fans   black adam is a refreshing glass of koolaid in the desert of aggressively bad superhero and genre material that weve been subjected to over the past couple of years     hopefully the batman black adam and its wonderful creditcameo  indicate that wbdiscovery has finally coursecorrected the dc cinematic universe towards a more successful path to joy and entertainment
Oct 27 2022,positive,although hawkman should of course be caucasian this is otherwise a solid flick the biggest mistake was brushing over how as shown in the comics nabu dr fate prince khufu hawkman and adam knew each other in the days of ancient egypt khufu reigned adam was the muscle and nabu was the court magician to reach modern times khufu reincarnated nabu put his power into the helmet and possesses whomever wears it and adam was put into suspended animation
Oct 27 2022,positive,great movie the rock was excellent  only reason it wasnt a 5 was that the storyline dipped part way in but overall great setting it up for the next run of movies cant wait
Oct 27 2022,positive,finally a movie with a proper superhero who thinks for himself
Oct 27 2022,positive,this is a fine example or professional critics not knowing a good movie when they see one   it is fantastically fun on every level and the rock clearly understands the character   there isnt a single bad performance  and at every turn you are entirely on teth adams side and figure the jsa and waller for morons
Oct 27 2022,positive,excellent and fresh portrayal of a much loved dc character the writers pieced together a simple yet entertaining story to establish the dcus latest anti hero i was also impressed with how well etched out the other heroes were although some may find the character tropes clicheunoriginal i feel they did great considering the limited time for character development given this film was a debut for all the superheroes all in all the audience must be taken into consideration and i am very confident that kids and families will find this movie electric
Oct 27 2022,positive,this movie will go down as one of the best dceu movies and also a turing point for the cinematic universe   excellent action solid story strong female characters without making them woke or looking masculine strong make characters that werent morons and a strong message about standing up for what is right even it means getting a little dirty in the process   910 movie for me
Oct 27 2022,positive,was good fun at the movies maybe black adam could have been more of a bad guy the scenes with paint it black and wild west standoff one were unnecessary but not annoying the mid credits scene was def worth it
Oct 27 2022,positive,awesome movie action from start to finish film like old times the rock is amazing and what a surprise with pierce brosnan
Oct 27 2022,positive,why make it about color and race dont clearly understand how he picked his name we all know hes black the plot was lost he showed a lot of anger and violence to society  i waisted my hard earned money on this first time in a long time i actually hated a movie
Oct 27 2022,positive,vfx are so 2022 of course its a happy ending but everything else is perfect
Oct 27 2022,neutral,some great action and good performances get bogged down by some weird choices characters and acting its like half good half i wish i could fast forward this
Oct 27 2022,positive,amazing movie saw it the 2nd time last night great job dc
Oct 27 2022,positive,it was a great movie my 6 year old daughter loved it and also my 70 year old mother loved it also
Oct 27 2022,positive,its fresh great and epic movie the plot twist in the end is unexpected good i like it
Oct 27 2022,positive,i liked everything
Oct 27 2022,negative,im actually very disappointed with black adam     although there were some decent action scenes that doesnt prevent the films messy and underwhelming plot writing and script with some characters that barely shown or had any opportunity to shine
Oct 27 2022,positive,an awesome watch for suredont listen to all the critics reviews since most of them watch the movie with a critical point of view and dont care if they really had fun or not its not really at their fault either since it is their job to see the movie in that perspective   the cgi sequences are just awesome and combined with the extraordinary background scores by lorne balfe the movie gives a great theatre experience the rock absolutely rocked in the mantle of black adam the story in itself is satisfactory for a solo superhero film returned from the theatre with satisfaction and most of my expectations fulfilled overall had a great time with the family just go for it and black adam will not disappoint
Oct 27 2022,positive,the film brings a very happy experience we want to see heroes acting like heroes dj is the perfect guy for the role henry cavil back crowned the best super ever
Oct 27 2022,positive,its the best movie ever made need to watch
Oct 27 2022,positive,definitely black adam is a hero movie set in the hero movie universe and above all it is an honest movie even with some minor script problems its a breath of virtue at a time when there are so many mediocre movie that dont respect the hero genre are content to make ridiculous humor and lack any symbology we want more from mr fate serious and confronting his vision and eternity hawkman dialoguing with the real meaning of being a hero in a world that is not simple atom smasher and cyclone coming of age and yes we want the urgent sequel to man of steel bravo 
Oct 27 2022,positive,the movie is great and will shape the dceu in an amazing way now with gunn and safran on the top
Oct 27 2022,positive,this movie is action packed and has some intense violent scenes this movie is a spectacle the rock is amazing as black adam the story isnt the deepest in film history but its entertaining i definitely got my monies worth not all superhero movies need to be 3 hours and an introspective about their life
Oct 27 2022,positive,best hero movie i see the rock rules dr fate so amazing too
Oct 27 2022,positive,enjoyed more than i thought i would finally dc on the right path
Oct 27 2022,positive,great movie i was expecting a boring repetitive superhero flicklike all the thor movies and the last 2 iron man flicks this was well paced and had a unique story my theory for the critics hateeither disney has them all paid off or they dont like seeing a middle eastern country although fake rising up against its white oppressors the cast was also not white washed youd think the pc police most critics nowadays would be happy but again disneys   money has a strangleholdcritics have to toe the line
Oct 27 2022,positive,best fight escene ever pure adrenaline the rock was born for this character
Oct 27 2022,negative,it was like watching a cartoon terrible writing basic plot truly awful music score stereotype voice acting and some truly wooden acting the mercenary who releases adam is a great example if you enjoyed shazam you may like this if you didnt youll find this equally hammy and tedious the bad writing was summed up in the cameo at the end we need to talk you wait years for the man of steel to return and you give him that very very poor film
Oct 27 2022,neutral,good for children 1215 who have not yet achieved discriminating taste
Oct 27 2022,positive,great movie and i hope in a stand alone movie with the story of dr fate
Oct 27 2022,positive,brilliant film really enjoyed it   my favourite dc film so far
Oct 27 2022,positive,loved the character chemistry and fight scenes story was also great the rock promised and delivered
Oct 27 2022,positive,way better than expected i believe dc has stolen budget from marvel im becoming a dc fan more and more now the rock stole the show
Oct 27 2022,positive,thought it was pretty entertaining  kind of slow at the beginning but picked up pace quickly  definitely stay for the mid credit scene
Oct 27 2022,positive,this is the best superhero movie ive ever seen the special effects were amazing but that little kid is so fucking annoying i want to break his neck
Oct 27 2022,positive,it was an amazing movie with some mistakes but it works
Oct 27 2022,positive,i watch the movie before knowing the critics now i feel like the critics are way too exaggerated for no reason at all sure i do wish therell be more for the climax but the movie is truly wonderful
Oct 27 2022,positive,the movie is what you exactly expect from a villain turned anti hero i like who they did try to soften the character just to glorify an actors strengths
Oct 27 2022,positive,the story is unbelievable must see
Oct 27 2022,positive,wow is this movie fun its action packed and is good watch for any dc fan and people who want a fun experience at the cinema its obviously not a perfect movie but i left the theater satisfied exactly what i excepted with a movie with the rock
Oct 27 2022,positive,this movie is great i love the daune and he got to play the rock sooooooooooooooooooooooo cool and not the best movie of all time of all the movies ive seen this one is good and its so funny hahahahaif you like movies this one of them so watch it or dont if you hate it but rember to rate 5 stars
Oct 27 2022,positive,its been a while since we had a superhero movie it really did action from beginning to end cgi characters soundtracks anyway the movie in general was very well built waiting for the next chapters the appearance of superman in the post credit left a like i want more
Oct 27 2022,positive,i was definitely entertained by the story acting cinematography and the special effects from beginning to end  overall the movie is great  despite a few ignorant comments in the reviews that parallel the villains in the movie
Oct 27 2022,positive,best superhero movie of 2022
Oct 27 2022,neutral,nice movie thrilling and dark
Oct 27 2022,positive,great action great acting by dr fate loved the movie
Oct 27 2022,positive,totally enjoy it 2 hours gone just like that
Oct 27 2022,positive,pure fun i think its the first superhero movie in the last few years that i actually enjoyed its like a breath of fresh air dwaynes the absolute goat
Oct 27 2022,positive,great movie fun thrilling ride its subtle but there is more food for thought about it afterwards cant understand the critics score versus us the fans clearly their score reflects other issues that have nothing to do with whats on the screen in front of them
Oct 27 2022,positive,cuz its black adam action driven and a cameo to look for
Oct 27 2022,positive,the movie sets up the continuation of the dc universe including superman shazam hawkman and others  dwayne johnson was fantastic as black adam  the back story of characters creation and origin was well told and awesome as well  i loved the movie  i also thought green lantern was great so there is that ha  this movie is big and should been viewed with speakers and on a big screen  fantastic  15 years in the making and very worth the wait
Oct 27 2022,positive,watched the movie will low expectations but i can confidently say its one of my favourite super hero movies ever there are some epic scenes in this and the soundtrack hits hard praying they bring out a second one
Oct 27 2022,positive,the movie is greatbut it felt like the a few portions needed more explanationit kinda felt like the movie just fast forwarded itself at times where there was a need for more explanationbut anyways loved 96 of my time while watching it
Oct 27 2022,positive,nice action pack movie henry cavill superman back 
Oct 27 2022,positive,great film tons of action and potential for the future plus the end credit scene was exciting dwayne johnson is the perfect black adam 
Oct 27 2022,positive,dc films are tough the lack of introductions to characters still carries on you are expected to know who everyone is with only a basic back ground given didnt ruin my experiance but for the uninitiated it may be a problem   i though the rock did a great job
Oct 27 2022,positive,it s interesting how critic reviews are released before the movie is actually in theaters and can destroy it in the process this was a good movie the best not really but definitely not a 40 the rock least charming movie its not supposed to be charming anyway fun movie and dr fate was phenomenal
Oct 27 2022,positive,solid 7510 not new as far as the premise but still fresh from the political direction mcu has currently wrapped themselves in  hope this is a reality check for the people up at wb that they can have and develop their own perspective and trademark as a cinematic universe if they listen to the audience and fans at the end of the day isnt that they make these movies for look forward to more dc movies like this
Oct 27 2022,positive,this movie is a masterpiece and how is this movie got a lower rating than thor love and thunder this movie is better than thor love and thunder in my opinion
Oct 27 2022,positive,not that bad as rotten tomatoes claims to be
Oct 27 2022,positive,probably one of the best dc movies after a very long time there was a huge struggle to get this movie made the way it was intended recommended watch for everyone im so happy that they listened to the fans and finally got rid of the old warner bros execs who were the main cause for the rot in the system the future of dc looks headed in the right direction
Oct 27 2022,positive,great movie a lot of action nice effects and no agenda in it highly recommended
Oct 27 2022,positive,much better than i expected it to be  the rock did a great job and really suprised me by the way he portrayed black adam   my hopes for the dceu are great and cant wait to see more
Oct 27 2022,positive,black adam is simply powerful  dwayne johnson is perfect in the role we clearly feel the anger of black adam   the justice society is incredible hawkman and doctor fate are extremely well done both in their outfits and in their interpretation doctor fate singlehandedly steals every scene he appears in  atom smasher and cyclone are also successful but a little behind it lacks a development of their link with the jsa especially for cyclone  the music is masterful and present throughout the film the special effects are incredible and sabbac is really great   the links with the dcu are perfect justice league the suicide squad peacemaker shazam not to mention this postcredits scene which alone deserves the viewing of the film    an excellent movie an excellent dc  cant wait for the dcu sequel 
Oct 27 2022,positive,i was happily surprised by the movie i think its a good jumpstart for the dcuniverise and i think they did a good job with the storytelling aspect as well i do wanna see more drfate in future movies as well as hawkman both are great characters that have a lot of room to grow
Oct 27 2022,positive,its what dc fans have been waiting for rock pulls off the stoic and menacing teth adam to perfection the action sequences were superb the story flowed pretty well all in all it was super fun
Oct 27 2022,positive,this movie lacks story quality and totally drops the ball on the on some of its character use and purposes action was impressive and the best i have ever seen the rock in anything a great watch for general audiences as well as a great start of the rebirth of the dceu
Oct 27 2022,positive,what i love about this film its everything you want in a dc film dc goodness was epic
Oct 27 2022,neutral,rotten no innovation bad use of the star cast and let down
Oct 27 2022,positive,the pacing was wierd  had good fight scenes
Oct 27 2022,positive,awesome the rock rocks and welcome back superman looking forward finally to more awesome movies from dc
Oct 27 2022,positive,i feel this movie opens dc to such a big universe towards which they could expand the fact that they introduced so many powerful characters and made it all the more sensible at the same time just shows dc has so much to grow for the ends that have been left untouched like dr fates helmet and its successor and the association of justice society and the agency that holds gods just shows that there is so much content for the years to come i feel this movie for me shall be rated as the third best on my list under dc after dark knight and dark knight rises it was an amazing experience and i enjoyed each minute of this dark cinematography 
Oct 27 2022,positive,very nice  fighting is cool
Oct 27 2022,positive,good old fashioned enjoyable movie no politics or other messaging involved dr fate was great as was hawkman you can always count on the rock to deliver a good show
Oct 27 2022,positive,great movie  saw it with my wife and daughter on saturday night  it was so great to see a movie tell a story finally  during the introduction of black adam they showed us how powerful he was instead of writing 5 pages of exposition  this was extremely fun for me to watch  do yourself a favor and go see this in a theatre  so worth it
Oct 27 2022,positive,one of the best movies ive seen in a while thanks next time make rated r
Oct 27 2022,positive,its a solid superhero movie my one gripe is that they could have swapped out one of the many middlemovie fights for some real character development other than that its a fun popcorn flick
Oct 27 2022,negative,movie was a disaster figthing scenes are like from 2000 movie cgi is weak plot is terrible whole story was boring and not logical since the begining of the movie till the end one of the worst superhero movies ever seen
Oct 27 2022,positive,definitely worth seeing
Oct 27 2022,positive,the rock did a great job hes a great actor except he didnt do tht thing w his chest but i was yawning nd shaking my while shorty was sleeping nd snoring
Oct 27 2022,positive,exceeded my expectations only problem being that i was not familiar with the superheroes in the movie and thats probably because i didnt read those comics overall a good movie
Oct 27 2022,positive,loved the movie  with all these marvel movies sucking badly black adam is shining like a star  none stop action movie that kept me at the edge of my seat  more please
Oct 27 2022,positive,the movie was great
Oct 27 2022,positive,i enjoyed it not a groundbreaking story but really engaging characters intense and the family loved it top marks
Oct 27 2022,positive,the movie brings what it promises lots of action beating good fight scenes and black adam actually changes the hierarchy of power at dc the film brings a character who doesnt save strength hits with will and shows that he has power funny moments with jokes of that kind of humor that is not forced  brought superman back all of us dc fans have been waiting for this the movie got me excited to see the confrontation between black adam and superman and for the upcoming dceu and superman movies  i loved dr fate and hawkman i hope dr fate come back pierce brosnan was perfect  a very good movie which delivers the emotion you feel when you see the trailers
Oct 27 2022,positive,good movie i like his electric wizard power
Oct 27 2022,negative,waste of money left mid movie
Oct 27 2022,positive,at worst its a 35 anyone who didnt like this movie is just picky i loved it
Oct 27 2022,positive,what were critics watching when they rated this under 40 this movie is really good action pack superhero film that would not try hard with silly jokes as others are doing
Oct 27 2022,positive,its really awesome making  technically strong   visual treatrock made   black  adam as real  totally the movie of the year  waiting for adam vs superman clash
Oct 27 2022,positive,had a fun time and enjoyed seeing my favorite dc characters on screen
Oct 27 2022,neutral,weve seen it all before very formulaic if youve seen any other super hero movie youve seen this one
Oct 27 2022,positive,movie exceeded my expectations really delivered during the third act with amazing visuals and a decent story stick around after the credits for a surprise the fans wont soon forget definitely would recommend anyone who is skeptical to see it for themselves
Oct 27 2022,positive,its a comic book movie i liked it better than most of the dc movies ive seen batman v superman was a complete mess this was awesome compared to that or 4 hours of batfleck or the sleeper that was the batman movie critics have to start putting these movies in the proper context they also need to pick up a comic book gotta go gonna watch it again
Oct 27 2022,negative,gunn cant take over fast enough to fire whichever writers made this mudpie this was worse than watching wrestling one liners i dont blame the rock or pierce for not being able to push this donkey of a film uphill to the promised marvel valley of good superhero flicks you couldnt get me to care about these characters anymore than a one episode badguy from got or hotd please fire everyone responsible for this and pair the rock up with superman and anyone that wrote for anything captain america or put this franchise in proper ruins
Oct 27 2022,positive,one of the best dc movies ive ever seen dont believe the critics because the movie is high testosterone without sealing and militancy and a lot of action worthy of the movies of these genres of heroes and antiheroes
Oct 27 2022,positive,lots of action and special effects story line could have been better
Oct 27 2022,positive,great character development awesome effects good overall story tempo
Oct 27 2022,neutral,not great glad james gunn will be taking over dc
Oct 27 2022,positive,great movie love effectsdc redemption cant wait for directors cut  cant wait till they tie everything together
Oct 27 2022,positive,this was one of the best movies ive watched this year i swear the action sequences gave me chills it had a good a story and i loved every second of it the rock this was worth 15 years in the making dawg
Oct 27 2022,positive,good superhero movie with sequel possibilities
Oct 27 2022,positive,nonstop action  great character recovery and lessons of humanity 
Oct 27 2022,positive,this movie was action packed from beginning to the end
Oct 27 2022,positive,amazing visual effects and intriguing plot line loved the actors and characters definitely going to see this movie again
Oct 27 2022,positive,we absolutely loved the movie  highly recommend it 
Oct 27 2022,positive,enjoy it from beginning to end dwayne is amazing as black adam
Oct 27 2022,positive,black adam was a lot of fun it doesnt quite reach the heights of some comic adaptations and is lacking some character development in favor of lots and lots of cgi action the rock is fantastic as the title character but the show is truly stolen by pierce bronson as dr fate this one is in the same tier as the first wonder woman and aquaman for me nothing ground breaking but an enjoyable couple of hours at the cinema
Oct 27 2022,positive,loved it very different from all other superhero movies and the graphics where surprisingly good
Oct 27 2022,positive,the movie was well done  the intro might have been a bit hurried and they could have really fleshed out the brutality of the overlords a bit more but tough to fit in 2 hours  the casting was really quite good the dialogue at times would approach the cheesiness of many recent super movies but at last moment would divert and move on rather than descending into campiness that has plagued so many movies lately  the humor between cast was used to relieve tension without turning the whole movie into a running joke  overall very enjoyable 2 hours and glad i went to see it
Oct 27 2022,positive,i personally liked it i loved the middle and directed the movie was also really good
Oct 27 2022,positive,awesome black adam surprised me from start to finish not to mention the post credit scene best superhero movie of the year 5
Oct 27 2022,positive,im not a dc fan but this movie was increidible and the post credit scene just extraordinary
Oct 27 2022,positive,i enjoyed the action sequences and a twist at the end but the comedy felt forced there are too many logical fallacies in the movie like how does black adam know english when he has been asleep for 5000 years     pierce steals the movie as doctor fate im not in any rush to see the sequels
Oct 27 2022,positive,my expectations for this movie were very high and i have to say that it didnt disappoint me at all its a very entertaining movie with tons of action and a good cast could be a little better with a couple details but overall its an enjoyable movie
Oct 27 2022,positive,i actually went to go see it because the critic said it sucked i thought it was a good movie overall
Oct 27 2022,positive,i liked the ending ending
Oct 27 2022,positive,so awsem amsing powers must see
Oct 27 2022,positive,in my opinion really good movie it delivers in all areas fun acting eff 40 is ridiculous we moviegoers arent all crazy
Oct 27 2022,negative,this movie was absolutely terrible the best part was pierce brosnan and the last 5 mins the boy in the movie was the most irritating kid ever
Oct 27 2022,positive,loved it great origin story too
Oct 27 2022,positive,its a very fun movie
Oct 27 2022,positive,really fun and entertaining without forcing the constant corny and lame jokes in superhero movies like marvel does black adam maintains the balance action comedy decent story and poor dialoge just like the marvel movies to deliver a fun flick this was way better than the most recent marvel movies out there dc is up to something while marvel is desperate running out of ideas
Oct 27 2022,positive,loved the movie   the rock was born to play black adam  its a great story of a common man becoming an unlikely superhero   the cameo at the end put it over the top  great job
Oct 27 2022,positive,hard to give anything 5 stars cause everything can be better  but it was very enjoyable
Oct 27 2022,positive,i loved this movie its action packed and so refreshing 
Oct 27 2022,positive,i enjoyed a lot dwayne johnson did an amazing job great movie
Oct 27 2022,positive,i absolutely loved the movie and almost everything about it hawkman and doctor fate both stood out to me in an incredible way so pleased that they actually did hawkman justice for once
Oct 27 2022,positive,the reason the score is so low is because of the marvel fan boys who cant accept dc has had a better year
Oct 27 2022,positive,it was action packed and mildly gorey which i liked however some of the characters were mid
Oct 27 2022,positive,just an all around really fun movie and the constant fighting kept me entertained throughout its entirety
Oct 27 2022,positive,dwayne johnson fits the role of black adam in my opinion guess you could say comic accuracy i guess but other than that great movie 
Oct 27 2022,positive,awesome when is the next one
Oct 27 2022,positive,touching story with amazing cinematic music and action sequences cemented this film as another great super hero movie with a take that breaks the mould
Oct 27 2022,positive,decent cgi predictable dull hero story as usual
Oct 27 2022,positive,its a typical superhero movie i enjoyed it
Oct 27 2022,negative,its official the dc universe is unsavable
Oct 27 2022,positive,its fresh air for dceu i truly recommend to see it people its a hit shazam
Oct 27 2022,negative,what a complete mess no discernible plot felt like a two hour long movie trailer
Oct 27 2022,positive,lots of action great special effects
Oct 27 2022,positive,entertaining but i dont think ill rewatch it more than once
Oct 27 2022,positive,the overall story is kinda stale and the characters are flat however the movie is action packed has stunning visuals comedy and amazing character designs this is how a superhero movie should be published especially its better than what the mcu is currently pumping out im so ecstatic at the mid credit scene as well
Oct 27 2022,positive,it was absolutely amazing it didnt have that weird directing and cinematography as the previous dc movies i love how they dont try and cram all the new characters backstories we dont need them straight to the point and very nicely paced
Oct 27 2022,negative,carried by action everything else is average at best
Oct 27 2022,positive,good movie on brand for dc
Oct 27 2022,positive,if dwayne johnson is there its a good movie
Oct 27 2022,positive,this is cinema please dont listen to the crittics you must watch at the cinema and enjoy a big experience
Oct 27 2022,positive,the movie provided enough action to keep me focused dwayne johnson did a hell of a job becoming black adam i cant wait to see how he goes up against superman
Oct 27 2022,neutral,felt like a cw show more violence and effects character can work though
Oct 27 2022,positive,obviously the critics are not in touch with what a good super hero movies is they care more about agendas the movie is definitely closer to what fans like than not
Oct 27 2022,positive,black adam was an amazing movie originally i thought that this movie wasnt gonna be much to talk about but i was very wong it had a lot of action and some awsome fight scenes the only reason its a 4 star and not a 5 is because they added satan into the movie i dont see the need although it was awsome to see him get ripped in half i just think that people are going to start taking satan as a joke and nothing to be serious about but anyway amazing movie dont listen to these woke people on twitter and other social media platforms cause their straight morons keep up the great work dwayne johnson cant wait for black adam 2
Oct 27 2022,positive,great action with wellcrafted fight scenes and graphics dialogue was cheesy at times but overall i would recommend this movie as watchable for any superhero fans 
Oct 27 2022,positive,both action and comedy we loved this movie
Oct 27 2022,positive,the legendary dwayne johnson the rock is lookin very powerful in the movie and there was a lot of action in the movie too and not only that but the rock embraces how powerful is neck looks   the rock has a good lookin neck plus he also has a good look academic neck
Oct 27 2022,positive,very good movies i love the anti heroes and the jsa
Oct 27 2022,positive,great movie if you are a comic book and super hero movie fan its fantasy so just enjoy it because its good there is an antihero black adam and there are dc super heroes dont pay attention to the critics they stink because they dont come to enjoy a fun movie they come to find every flaw and whine about it
Oct 27 2022,positive,speaking as a 56 year old comic nerd the move was good  not terrific not terrible  people keep talking about it as being a clone of one super team or another  ive read enough dc and marvel in my time to know that anytime you do a movie like this stuff gets left out stuff that did get in doesnt match up with what you know  i know however that if i had watched this without a single bit of comic book baggage i would have enjoyed it  having as much comic baggage i do have i still enjoyed it  dwayne johnson did a good job none of the casting gave me any twitchness  would it have been better to give this character an introduction before a stand alone film probably  was it better or worse than say shazam id call it on par with it  go see it make up your own mind
Oct 27 2022,positive,fantastic movie the rock is black adam
Oct 27 2022,positive,dont understand the critics these days i thought this was an amazing surprise funny and action packed i loved it wasnt sure how dwayne would do in this role but did great
Oct 27 2022,neutral,a decent movie but a bust consider the rock and the budget need snyder
Oct 27 2022,positive,great movie action packed and funny
Oct 27 2022,positive,great movie and worth the wait honestly shocked by critics criticism and it kinda seems like theyre getting paid for negative reviews for dc movies
Oct 27 2022,positive,great movie minus the whole rockafella uprising
Oct 27 2022,positive,good movie not great but really good and worth a watch
Oct 27 2022,positive,a cinematic universe is born
Oct 27 2022,positive,was an amazing movie the action and characters kept me entertained for the entire film this is the reboot the dceu needs
Oct 27 2022,positive,dwayne is the man awesome movie
Oct 27 2022,positive,was actually really really good
Oct 27 2022,neutral,i thought the movie was confusing too much cgi but it got better towards the end i thought the humor was not well thought out and generally missed the mark
Oct 27 2022,positive,awesome action packed movie and good story
Oct 27 2022,positive,i think its safe to say that the critics got this movie very wrong like its so vastly different between what they think and what the world thinks that most of them should just find new professions the movie was amazing definitely gave dc new hope the only thing i could think was that because the supporting heros were not known by many who were not comic heads besides that connecting feeling of knowing them missing this was a fantastic first step to rebuilding dc and bringing back a favorite
Oct 27 2022,positive,story could have been better the tornado girl and atom smasher didnt have much of a role so didnt add much at all if they werent in the movie would have not noticed as they didnt add too much howkman attitude was a bit over the top extreme
Oct 27 2022,positive,great movie better than any marvel movie out this year this movie did not go woke thank goodness 
Oct 27 2022,positive,the writing of some sequences was a little rusty but other than that what a fantastic movie it is
Oct 27 2022,positive,black adam was a fun ride through and through the film wasnt super spectacular but definitely enjoyable its a throwback to the early days of superhero movies when they were fun exciting explosive and easy to watchthe story is simple and easy to follow kudos to dwayne johnson and the rest of the crew i hope this is the first in many great dc films
Oct 27 2022,positive,was a great movie i had a lot of fun thanks you dwayne for this awesome movie 
Oct 27 2022,positive,i freaking loved this movie i think it is the 2nd best dceu movie behind only zsjl ignore the critics score the audience score is the only score worth merit so much plot action character development fighting and drama is packed into a compact 2 hour movie i love dr fate fighting the demon king with multiple clones and all the action scenes were top notch i loved the introduction of 4 new superheroes who i have never seen in the dceu before i love black adam as a complex antihero i love dr fate sacrificing himself i just want more dr fate cloning himself to valiantly contain a demonic beast so that the real hero has time to vanquish the beast solid movie excellent addition to the dceu so excited for sequels and more character development from atom man hawkman the wind girl and black adam i love the political undertones of oppression imperialism democracy vs rule by a king such a fun movie i will def watch it again when it comes to hbomax

Oct 26 2022,positive,special effects and moral of the story
Oct 26 2022,positive,the movie is great full of action adam is brutal but the human core especially the child is tedious
Oct 26 2022,positive,pretty good start then it kind of dips into generic me personally i would have liked to see black adam and sabbac punch kick and throw each other through buildings but that fight ended up being anticlimactic as hell
Oct 26 2022,positive,it was so nice for a dc film to finally breath some life into the universealso hawkman was so cool to see as well
Oct 26 2022,negative,it was entertaining but it seem like something i made last minute for a class assignment semi plagiarized off marvel movies to turn in a c caliber paper but the teacher gave me a d but i know she wanted to give an f but gave me something for the effort

Oct 26 2022,positive,loved it allout action  great special effects
Oct 26 2022,positive,black adam is a movie that dutifully entertains the best part of the movie is the action and without a doubt it will not leave you disappointed in that aspect
Oct 26 2022,negative,it was a mess hes barely an antihero because he only ever really killed bad guys if this is the future of dc it looks like were just getting more of the same garbage
Oct 26 2022,positive,there are packs of action and the visual effects are so eyecatching especially the effect of dr fate and there are many character introductions and the story not too complicated so easy to follow so recomended

Oct 26 2022,positive,i have see in brazilian cines and the movie is amazing
Oct 26 2022,positive,otimo filmes fazia um bom tempo que um filme de heroi me chamava atenção acho que o futuro do universo da dc vai crescer dwayne johnson foi feito para esse papel é esquecer a critica especializada por que parece que tem algo errado com eles  great movies its been a long time since a hero movie caught my attention i think the future of the dc universe will grow dwayne johnson was made for this role forget the specialized critics because it seems that theres something wrong with them 
Oct 26 2022,positive,love the action from beginning to end cgi can be a little less in some parts but loved the movie regardless
Oct 26 2022,negative,ill start my saying i love comic book movies and i usually find dwayne johnson enjoyable to watch but this movie is a trainwreck of entirely one note characters horrendous dialogue and some of the most confusing narrative choices i have ever seen in a movie by confusing i mean i dont understand how the director thought they were good ideas they were fairly easy to follow just mind blowing terrible choices    dont waste your life watching this movie do literally anything else
Oct 26 2022,positive,very entertaining  we enjoyed it
Oct 26 2022,positive,i was smiling for nearly the entire runtime of black adam first time in a long time ive left a theater feeling good most beautiful looking film ive seen in years as well great job
Oct 26 2022,positive,i dont know why they hate this so much it is one of the best comic book films ive ever seen yes it doesnt have the best plot and it has many fight sequences but after all it is a super hero comic book film what did you expected and then the post credit scene is the best in the dceu
Oct 26 2022,positive,the 2 hours of unstoppable action with epic fights explosions and  dwayne johnson is everything i needed
Oct 26 2022,positive,i really enjoyed this movie i think dc comics is getting better and i hope they release more entertaining movies
Oct 26 2022,negative,a tonal mess of a movie it was billed as a darker antihero flick what we got was an overstuffed mess of cgi with black adam being a supporting character in his own movie the pacing was relentless the score was nonstop and cheap sounding and the cgi was at times extremely dated to sum up the negative critic reviews are on the ball with this one
Oct 26 2022,positive,lots of action really wish it was rated r
Oct 26 2022,positive,i loved the movie it was funny a action packed movie this is a must see

Oct 26 2022,positive,amazing had a great time watching this movie
Oct 26 2022,positive,the movie itself is fine very unpretentious unlike most of marvels outings in the last few years it feels like some of the newer characters didnt get enough development and personally would have liked to seen them do something different with dr fate no spoilers and black adams origin story could have been fleshed out a bit more  but overall its a decent popcorn flick
Oct 26 2022,positive,we liked the movie good srory line and a lot of action

Oct 26 2022,positive,i thought the movie did a great job introducing characters to the dc movie universe that many may not have known dwayne johnson has proven that perseverance pays off when you believe in yourself and your vision for a great movie thanks also for finally bringing hawkman into the cinematic world and doing him justice i cant wait for the hawkman movie and black adam 2 this was a fun actionpacked movie that satisfied on many levels
Oct 26 2022,positive,pretty good for an origin movie this movie is totally for audience and not critics

Oct 26 2022,positive,this movie is full of heart and the cinematics are astounding i love the tone of the movie and i think that this is the resurgence of something big in the dc universe
Oct 26 2022,positive,in the avg dc movie range pretty good but not outstanding but given the lack of anything worth watching in the last 4 weeks it a good show
Oct 26 2022,positive,a very enjoyable action superhero movie with interesting superhero characters it isnt the perfect movie but its a 1010 on the action and experience
Oct 26 2022,positive,grants you a good time not much of a deep story nor movie but it sure is fun characters that you instantly fall in love with even with little screen time action sequences are amazing with great cgi excited about the future of the dceu
Oct 26 2022,positive,exciting movie full of action scenes and entertaining great cast and visuals
Oct 26 2022,positive,more entertaining than good
Oct 26 2022,positive,i go to super hero movies to be entertained and i was
Oct 26 2022,positive,the movie did exactly what a superhero action movie should do be fun  dont go into it expecting a shawshank redemption and you will be entertained  thanks to the rock for persevering and making this movie finally and fulfilling your promise midcredits scene
Oct 26 2022,positive,about time another good anti hero movie dc needs to embrace its darkness
Oct 26 2022,positive,action was amazing plot was eh characters were good way better than the marvel movies this year
Oct 26 2022,positive,opening fight scene  epic  past story building  meh  comedy  good  visuals  epic  black adam suit  epic with hood but meh without hood  jsa suits  epic  climax  meh  bgm  good  cinematics  epic  scene transitions  meh
Oct 26 2022,positive,action packed it kept me entertained the entire time
Oct 26 2022,negative,cobbled together superhero tropes very heavyhanded with themes and it felt like the epitome of playing it safe
Oct 26 2022,positive,this was a good movie only one or two moments where i said to myself ok move on dwayne johnson is a beast cant wait to see this again my new favorite super hero i loved pierce brosnan dr fate was a great addition his character really helped bring the movie over the top
Oct 26 2022,positive,finally dc is getting right make super hero movies as if they are real the more real to life the better excellent origin story with a twist that made it even better than the comics
Oct 26 2022,positive,def one of the best dc movies ive seen in a very long time not as great as most marvel movies but pleasantly surprised for the dc universe
Oct 26 2022,positive,not the best storyline or writing but it was still very entertaining and worth the time the effects are great and theres subtle humor throughout dr fate and black adam were my favorite and hawkman wasnt bad towards the end if you go to the movies for an escape this will deliver
Oct 26 2022,positive,i loved the story and it shows an amazing future for dc the rock absolutely nailed his role for black adam the movie was fun and had a lot of action and comedy definitely a must see
Oct 26 2022,positive,i thought the movie was generally fun and gave the hero a better story arch than many super movies  plenty of discontinuities and plot holes but i enjoyed it and it finally presented us a good story rather than a general political statement      and thanks for giving us henry cavill back  that was worth at least 12 a star by itself
Oct 26 2022,positive,the film is awesome dc fans will love it
Oct 26 2022,positive,to rushed to many new characters i dont care about the rock did solid not the best but pretty good for him i really came for what happened at the end for our great cameo i wont spoil it but its amazing even for that few seconds
Oct 26 2022,positive,if black adam gets what he wants its the end game for marvel
Oct 26 2022,positive,i thought it was a fast paced action packed adventure it introduced new and old characters the plot was pretty simple but the action kept me wanting to see what was coming next great cgi effects some things were a little off like how the mortal ground walkers could catch up to the fast moving flying heroes so quickly but that didnt bother me it also shows superheroes are people with emotions that can change how they look at the world good acting from all one of dwaynes best even with all the influx of superhero movies this one is one of dcs best
Oct 26 2022,positive,loved the movie compared to other dc movies this is in the top 5  i dont include the batman movies because there are too many of them just action packed fun reasonably true to the source material  bringing in the justice society was epic and a great way to honor the dc old guard cant wait for more black adam
Oct 26 2022,positive,its was such a blast to see a superhero movie movie just be for what it is fun thats what i got and thats all i ever ask for
Oct 26 2022,positive,its been a while since a good movie like this came out it isnt perfect but this movie brings a different pattern inside a well known pattern there is growth for almost every carachter what is very satisfying fight scenes arent john wick level but its pleasant i havent had that feeling since avengers endgame final battle
Oct 26 2022,negative,the theater wasnt open again im losing a fortune buying tickets through fandango
Oct 26 2022,positive,black adam is an enjoyable film with plenty of amusement the film is far from perfect and its flaws can easily be picked apart like the simple storyline and predictable events but has many pros going for it including astounding cgi great characters and constant action make it a thrilling ride of a film
Oct 26 2022,positive,the movie was just fire perfect movie
Oct 26 2022,positive,it was action packed as funny as you can expect from a dark action movie the visuals were amazing the suits were amazing there were many references to other heroes overall it was a very good  entertaining movie i had goosebumps during a lot of scenes and even though the mid credit scene was short it had such a massive impact that some may not realize at first the cast was great and if you want to watch a movie a great story great fights and great characters black adam is the one for you
Oct 26 2022,positive,let me just start with was this the best movie ever made no but as far as superhero movies go this was really up there  far better than some others i have seen recently from marvel and dc themselves the atmosphere of the movie was great the cgi was also great so im not sure why some reviews have slated it much better than a certain cgi giant evil starfish the storyline was in depth enough that my attention was kept through the whole 2 hours but not so much so that i didnt know what was going on or who anybody was we got just enough back story on other characters without making this a justice society movie the sole focus was on black adam the writers did a great job with black adams character and back story and his struggle with not being a hero there was also good plot twists in the movie too there were good comedic moments without the need to force a laugh but little enough that it didnt become a mock of a superhero film people in the cinema screen laughed out loud at certain points of the movie but it still never took anything away from the film the actorscharacters or the storyline overall it was really enjoyable and the audience reviews speak for themselves over the slander the film received from the critics reviews if you like superheroes movies movies about superheroes and something worth watching on the big screen instead of mindless entertainment to stream at home then that makes this movie worth 5 stars alone never mind the fact that its actually a great superhero film
Oct 26 2022,positive,special effects were pretty good but plot was obvious and predictable was hoping it would be one of the better dc movies but it was more like a vehicle for dwayne johnson than anything else
Oct 26 2022,positive,fun and action packed great example of a comic book come to life
Oct 26 2022,positive,the movie is well made i really hope this continues in man of steel 2 am anticipated to watch again good job mr johnson perfect role
Oct 26 2022,positive,i signed up just to leave this review  for the first time in my life i can relate to a hero in a dc universe black adam is a middle east hero that portrays all the pain arabic nations are going through including the occupation of their countries for resources and big boys showing up only to make it worse also black adam kicks ass looking forward to a sequel
Oct 26 2022,positive,excellent action and cgi story was also decent for a dc film    dc still however needs to iron out some of the cringey acting
Oct 26 2022,positive,it had star power with the heroes its intensity and captivity dwindled in places but overall it was worth the price of a matinee
Oct 26 2022,positive,lots of superhero action totally fun popcorn movie
Oct 26 2022,positive,great action balanced comedy the rock was scary in a great way
Oct 26 2022,positive,i dont understand why ppl giving it bad reviews its the story of black atom its gonna be dark its directed towards adults more then kids people have to stop with the mondest of dc has to be marvel dc needs to be dc this movie showed it
Oct 26 2022,positive,this movie was great i loved it dwayne johnson does a great job as black adam i honestly didnt get bored at all while watching this movie it was just one scene after another and i found it very entertaining theres a few comedic relief scenes here but nothing too extra whoever the critics are on this movie are completely trippin and i wouldnt believe a word they say about this movie this movie was fun and entertaining and is totally worth checking out
Oct 26 2022,positive,amazing movie feel like the critics have a negative bias for very bad reasons but not getting into that always loved black adam as a character nice to see him done justice on the big screen and it not having to be a white guy with blue eyes for the superhero to be unstoppable and likeable with incredible abilities superman is still awesome though and thats coming from a white guy with blue eyes whose 6ft plus just think this was a project that needed to be done and it did not disappoint amazing movie ignore the critics go watch
Oct 26 2022,positive,best movie ever im looking forward for the sequel
Oct 26 2022,positive,action packed loved it
Oct 26 2022,negative,possibly one of the worst movies ever what a mess horrible direction no story cringey dialogues incoherent editing      this is not superhero fatigue this is simply a  really really bad movie     this is dc trying too hard this is what rushing and falling flat on your face looks like    what on earth were the makers thinking such a bloody mess    give them some razzies
Oct 26 2022,positive,pretty good action and bad ass suit
Oct 26 2022,positive,amazing actor and wonderful special effects
Oct 26 2022,negative,it plays like a parody of super hero movies akin to the in world movies sending up the genre in the boys its another movie where the rock cant get hurt where he recounts a tragic backstory jungle cruise scorpion king where he cocks an eyebrow where hes the most powerful being on screen and where he obviously wins paper thin characters and pointless actions a third act sacrifice couldve been avoided entirely by the use of logic distractingly bad supporting actors the lead henchman in the tomb scenes performance will stick with you long after hes been disintegrated or whatever happened to him in the cgi meelé and two of the jsa characters do nothing of value apart from flirt and talk about how powerful the rock sorry teth adam is it ties in to existing dc properties purely for the sake of doing so which only serves to divert the movie from its inevitable cgi smackdown finale for another excruciating few minutes even my 12 year old son asked me how long it had been since we last saw daylight and my youngest asked repeatedly when it would end i wanted to love it but it is the latest in a long line of poorly conceived dc properties that only have a few passable efforts
Oct 26 2022,positive,movie was fun to watch from start to finish i really enjoyed the action 
Oct 26 2022,positive,love it  cant wait to see number 2
Oct 26 2022,positive,the best dc movie since christopher reeves in superman from the 70s
Oct 26 2022,positive,screw the critics this movie was a lot of fun plenty of action and comedy
Oct 26 2022,positive,the rocks performance is fantastic  fantastic production and fight sequences  some moments were dull and felt overstretched and some moments were cringeworthy pierce brosnans performance was fantastic
Oct 26 2022,positive,phenomenal finally a movie that focuses on the true essence of comics without trying to force feel political or biased agendas great action sequences and character building outstanding performance from the rock and pierce brosnan  a must watch
Oct 26 2022,positive,great movie with tons of action loved it
Oct 26 2022,positive,great movie with a good story loved the mid credits loved the story and showing the duality of the character tired of black and white heroes and villains
Oct 26 2022,positive,this is one of the most entertaining movies ive seen in the last few years kept my interest all the way through the cast is phenomenal a great popcorn flick
Oct 26 2022,positive,very cool action movie i love it
Oct 26 2022,positive,one of the best dceu movies that ive seen my friend and i said halfway through the movie that it was the best dceu movie theyve done besides the suicide squad this is a must go see movie
Oct 26 2022,positive,basically your typical superhero movie but loaded with action and a not so comic accurate but decent storyline  i wish they elaborated more on the jsa as to origins of cyclone and atomsmasher and truly how old hawkman was as well as dr strange  did enjoy it though and would definitely return to theaters to view again
Oct 26 2022,positive,johnson is great as usual but this movie still runs into that marvel already did it and its better issue brosnan also had a decent performance but the other characters just left you saying meh a decent enough watch to pass the time but nothing i would need to see again
Oct 26 2022,positive,the movie is superbly fulfilling all of this goals    a 2 hours great cinematic experience   a visual delight for the eyes and ears lorne bafle really did a great job at compilling us a great soundtrack   the introduction of the justice society with an incredible performance of dr fatepierce brosnan   dwayne johnson camping an antihero story which brings a bit darkness and trouble to a well established hierarchy of powers    cant wait to see his next adventure
Oct 26 2022,positive,its what you should expect from an action movie  lots and lots of fantastic graphics and of course action younger viewers will really enjoy this tad long
Oct 26 2022,positive,the characters for superhero are a bit different but very entertaining for me i didnt realized that the movie was 2 hours and change because it  kept you watching i really liked the plot and black adams as a superhero he is definitely not your average hero enjoy
Oct 26 2022,positive,it was a great origin story with good action throughout  it didnt drag like some dc movies have in the past  it was just a fun movie to watch  looking forward to a sequel already
Oct 26 2022,positive,black adam is awesome full of fan services and is remarkable to new dc phase   the rock is in great shape and his dedication to this project is notably   the cgi is very good and the script is aligned with happens in the cb stories
Oct 26 2022,negative,slow too log no good acting at all would not recommend unless killing time
Oct 26 2022,negative,movie was ok thanks to the senior rate  more disappointed in that the movie was scheduled to start at 1100 but due to all the previews and advertising did not start until 1120  please use the actual start time in your advertising of the movie
Oct 26 2022,negative,ridiculous and formulaic  the rock was great and it missed an opportunity to make the most of his character
Oct 26 2022,positive,for a superhero  antihero movie it was somewhere between good and very good the cgi was mostly good and the action scenes were very cool they had a lot of ground to cover setting up the characters and the story between that and the near constant action there wasnt a lot of time left over for a deep story its ok though because the movie was fun and entertaining  the villian was a little sub par ill definitely watch it again and i look forward to a sequel
Oct 26 2022,positive,after robert downey jr and hugh jackman now dwayne johnson and pierce brosnan has entered my list of favourites a dc movie in the way we wanted fingers crossed for a justice league  black adam cross over
Oct 26 2022,negative,the movie was a 25 at best dewayne johnson acting in this movie sucked there are movies he is great in and i for one like dewayne johnson  but he should have passed on this one the real reason anyone would rate this movie higher would be that they are a hardcore fan that wouldnt want his feelings hurt this is truly the worst film he has done yet not worth watching twice unless you are just bored and cant find anything else to watch
Oct 26 2022,positive,the rock was great in this role i felt like he tapped into his wwe days with some of the scenes in the movie the action is great and some shots are pretty cool i did not have enough connection with the jsa characters to feel what was happening onscreen with them i loved seeing mr bond himself play dr fate i wish we could have gotten an hbo show or something with the jsa prior to this film i felt the story was a bit too scattered and also thought the cgi was pretty bad overall the movie is enjoyable and the end credit scene is satisfying i wouldnt say this is the best film in the dc franchise but certainly not the worst
Oct 26 2022,positive,it was awesome loved every second of it i hope this will help dceu to get back in track rocks black adam and pierce brosnans dr fate was phenomenal
Oct 26 2022,positive,i dont understand the low review score this was a great addition to the dc universe it had some good action with some pretty hilarious moments i do think the movie takes a hit when it comes to its fv ill aim and the final battle mainly because the villain is kind of boring and the effects on his demon transformation look a little weird but other than that i really enjoyed it
Oct 26 2022,positive,i dont know why so much bad reviews the movie was great better than other super hero movies released within past 23 years i am not a dc fan but it was a good movie i have to say
Oct 26 2022,positive,henry cavil back as superman is all i wanted to see from dceu
Oct 26 2022,positive,top action movie dj was made for black adam the critics are very bias ignore them great to see supes back
Oct 26 2022,positive,the kid and his mum were annoying but besides that the movie was a good watch
Oct 26 2022,positive,this movie was great imo the critics are probably mcu meatriders
Oct 26 2022,positive,honestly not the worst movie i have ever seen it is quite goofy at some parts but the vfx are stunning overall insanely average
Oct 26 2022,positive,awesome movie i always prefered marvel but this is in my opinion better than alot of marvel films definitely recommend it best dc character no doubt
Oct 26 2022,positive,super fun dwayne johnson is dc savior the movie is fantastic it has what a comic book fan desire this movie is great  it has a lot of action  the story is good and it has the best slow motion scenes i have ever scene it is darkness which makes black adam what other heroes cannot do that is black adams style of justice most enemies you dont have to waste your time to be kind to them u just have to show them how tough you are
Oct 26 2022,positive,an absolute thrill ride of pure escapism and fun fresh and with a fantastic supporting cast thank god the dc movie universe has some hope again loved it
Oct 26 2022,positive,as a lifelong fan of dwayne both in the ring and on the big screen i have to say im proud to see him move from strength to strength and yet again prove that he has the chops to hang with the best action icons of our times i will come out to see any project hes involved withjust an all around entertainer workaholic and genuinely good person peoples champ
Oct 26 2022,positive,the difference between critics is sufficient enough to say how bias the critics are between marvel and dc black adam is the best superhero movie of 2022 dr strange and thor didnt live up to the expectations but blackadam was solid the post credit gave hope for the future of dc dont focus on critics
Oct 26 2022,positive,the best hero movies the last years
Oct 26 2022,positive,great action and overall good movie
Oct 26 2022,positive,as for a movie which is based on comic book the introduction of character is neat with introducing new characters to dcu and its well action packed and visually stunning graphics work quality over quantity adam rules
Oct 26 2022,negative,black adam is okay overall i thought dwayne the rock johnson was great as the title character but it descends into real genericness black adams character gets gradually less interesting and more generic as the film goes on there are a bunch of supporting characters who are secondrate copies  and i mean direct copies  of other characters ant man is in there but with deadpools mask doctor strange is in there storm was there i think the xmen jet is used all the time the whole thing is even set in wakanda you have the usual slomo action to a random song a la zack snyder at which point i heard audible sighs in the audience the main bad guy is someone i cant even remember but his thing is that he summons the parademons again or something it was derivative as hell the rock the only good thing about it was the rock and only then for the first half it felt too long overall and i wouldnt particularly anticipate a sequel its watchable but its also like all the lessons of the dc failures of the last 10 years have been crammed into a movie all over again
Oct 26 2022,positive,black adam is a fun popcorn flick no real message or thought was presented for the audience to ponder just a fun action movie mixed in with dcs b and c list heroes although dr fate is really powerful in the comics but mid in this movie id say overall its one of the better movies of 2022
Oct 26 2022,positive,could have been so much more thirs act was pretty copy and paste from 20 other super hero movies but enjoyable overall
Oct 26 2022,positive,honestly one of dcs best movies since the dark knight trilogy it had fun parts and the action was great to watch they picked great actors for each of the characters i really like cyclone and atom smashers interaction it was nice to step away from the justice league and meet the less flashy justice society i would definitely go see it again and recommend it to any one it gave me the same level of excitement that i miss from the preendgame marvel movies
Oct 26 2022,positive,better than expected not a rock fan but my kid is so took him to see it best role hes done yet good job of making him look and feel immensely powerful messy in spots but overall enjoyable
Oct 26 2022,positive,great movie    no push an agenda  no brainwash  no indoctrinate     just amazing cg wonderful action scenes and everything we expect from a good superhero movie
Oct 26 2022,positive,nice addition to the dc movie universe   nothing new here but highly entertaining for the entire 2 hours cavil coming in at end as superman was incredible love the cavil superman best superman ever
Oct 26 2022,positive,i really enjoyed the movie i hope dc continues down this path
Oct 26 2022,positive,was a blast its nice seeing dc universe shaping into something
Oct 26 2022,positive,really good   would recommend to friends and family
Oct 26 2022,positive,really good first half followed by an above average second half overall a really good entertainer
Oct 26 2022,positive,really liked this movie it wasnt the rock in a costume no eye brow or charm just an angry aggressive antihero effects were good loved seeing dr fate on screen
Oct 26 2022,positive,the rock was absolutely perfect for this role im not a big superhero fan but i enjoyed the movie  it had a good balance of drama and comedy and had good special effects the aftercredit scene was promising
Oct 26 2022,positive,great  the best hero movie of the year  expert criticism will have to accept
Oct 26 2022,neutral,dwayne johnson does a great job at playing the part  thats the good  the bad  its a mediocre movie  i love superhero movies and this one just couldnt do what it intended to do  disappointing
Oct 26 2022,positive,black adam  drfate just rocked throughout their scenes superb action great vfx a simple story and pure fan service more of this dc
Oct 26 2022,positive,entertaining movie highly recommended
Oct 26 2022,positive,fire movie the score the visual effects the cinematography choreography and the cast chefs kiss the cast was perfect their acting was brilliant and the chemistry between them felt so organic the humor in the movie didnt feel forced at all and the jokes were actually funny and the fact that they added so many jokes and still managed to keep the tone of the movie serious and heavy is just impressive movie is simply a masterpiece
Oct 26 2022,positive,come on its the rock whats not to like a bit long as it drags a bit in the beginning cg starts to wear thin but the reveal near the end as to the back line story of ba is worth the price of admission
Oct 26 2022,positive,while it served as a solid popcorn movie tonally the film was inconsistent at some major parts and some of the final vfx shots and sound mixing here and there needed some extra tlc but the costume design was amazing many of the performances held up and the camera work was awesome
Oct 26 2022,positive,really enjoyed this movie action was great sound was earth shattering not impressed with the imax screen overall i found the movie to be very entertaining and well made 
Oct 26 2022,positive,tons of actionmaybe too much good pacing and performances best dc movie not counting the batman in a good while
Oct 26 2022,positive,great movie i was missing the dark side in powerful characters such as black adam cant wait to see whats coming in the dc universe
Oct 26 2022,positive,i dont know who these reviewers are but i have to ask  are you qualified to be a movie reviewer seriously i just watched this movie last and it was absolutely fantastic the rock played black adam perfectly definitely not a boring movie from start to finish this movie was epic if you love comics laughter and action then this movie has it all
Oct 26 2022,positive,great movie dwayne johnson as black adam  and the mid credit
Oct 26 2022,positive,great movie with better fights and flying effects the characters are good with adam and fate stealing the scene  at one point i felt i was rewatching suicide squad with the copicat minions coming from hell just to be defeated by a mere mortal with a piece of pipe tube this and the awful western score way too loud i really enjoyed the movie the cameo just took it from a 4 star rating to a 5 the movie got the dceu to where it should have always been
Oct 26 2022,positive,exactly what i wanted felt like an early mcu movie but with a strong tie to what i know about black adam the fight scenes were insanely good never felt like the immersion was broken save for one moment with the civilians ready for man of steel 2 please
Oct 26 2022,positive,as a dc fan i loved black adam and at the end superman was chary on top
Oct 26 2022,positive,excelent action some of the best superhero punches ive ever seen in a live action the story and dialogue seemed rushed and i couldnt connect with the characters however this is a very important step in the right direction for dc i hope there will he an r ratted version released thank you dwayne
Oct 26 2022,positive,i was exhausted after watching this movie in a good way so much going on all the time  you barely have time to breathe  it is a longish movie but the pace is relentless   one of dcs better storiesmovies
Oct 26 2022,positive,for a dc movie its above average
Oct 26 2022,positive,this movie is a lot of fun with some great superhero fight scenes its not amazing and not super unique but its worth watching also the stinger is awesome
Oct 26 2022,positive,it was ok dwayne johnson is great in black adam
Oct 26 2022,positive,it was amazing to watch a real antihero not telling jokesdeadpool
Oct 26 2022,positive,best movie of all time and i love the ending of the movie and the movie is the best one of the year
Oct 26 2022,positive,it is not a bad movie and neither a good movie  based in its script  it is an entertainment movie and the best part is at the end
Oct 26 2022,positive,love this movie  the rock was awesome 
Oct 26 2022,positive,it was a good movie  overhated imo
Oct 26 2022,positive,it was a great movie all around at times was a little predictable but was always keeping you on the edge of your seat wanting to see what was next the cg was on point the rock did a great job hyping the movie up and kept it true to its word
Oct 26 2022,positive,i hate warner bros for killing cartoon network and all the good cartoons but cant hate them for this movie not going to slander it dont have to go see it its good
Oct 26 2022,positive,great action movie  poor acting from some of the supporting cast but thats not what were here for anyways
Oct 26 2022,positive,there are some plot holes and questionable decisions by the human characters but that being said black adam was still a fun ride the action was jampacked and almost never stopped when it started looking forward to see more of dwayne johnsons take of these dc characters and hopefully create consistent great movies for the dceu
Oct 26 2022,positive,great action  dwayne johnson did a great job as always in all the movie was great a must see all characters was great
Oct 26 2022,positive,mainly liked it a lot  some corny parts but not that big a deal
Oct 26 2022,positive,cinematic understands the source material but keeps it original
Oct 26 2022,positive,best super hero movie in a long time its definitely kept me entertained the entire time
Oct 26 2022,positive,i enjoyed the back story and the plot twists  action scenes were great and dwaynes looks almost negated the need for dialogue he really is a great actor  all casting choice were right on and the whole movie was non stop fun  highly recommend 
Oct 26 2022,positive,exactly what dc needs stay for the credits you wont be disappointed the story needed exposition earlier on but instead sprinkled it over the course of the movie not a bad thing different and i liked it mostly comic accurate and has good funny moments 
Oct 26 2022,positive,ill just start by saying i like dc but im more of a marvel guy this movie was so damn good i definitely feel this is one of dcs best when i thought the movie was ending it continued with more awesome action never felt long and lots of cool characters
Oct 26 2022,positive,the rock seemed born to play black adam wish they gave him pointy ears like the comics but he fits the role of anti hero very well you can deff tell this movie was meant to be rated r with all the violence only thing that was badannoying was the kid and that stupid skateboard lol 
Oct 26 2022,positive,one of the best overpowered super hero movies ive seen the action was amazing and if you ever wanted to see superman not hold back on an enemy black adam gave it to you he was literally ripping people apart  also the story was very good and made some good points about imperialism and the peoples will
Oct 26 2022,positive,action packed emotional hilarious and visually amazing my jaw was on the ground the whole movie 1010 cant wait to watch again
Oct 26 2022,positive,i thought this film was beautifully made the rock gave an incredible performance it definitely is the best movie dc has made since wonder woman the mom and kid were the only part that at times got on my nerves it was super enjoyable to watch and i would recommend 
Oct 26 2022,positive,i feel like they tried to pack so much into a short a mount of time  felt like justice league  not enough progression    action was pretty good
Oct 26 2022,positive,the movie is an absolute breathtaking and refreshing sight to dc fans with only a healthy bit of clicheness the directors have finally brought in the dc cannon that fans have expected from the comics with dc not putting out good movies in the past decade and with marvel messing up on all projects this was a open door for dc to burst to and which they did
Oct 26 2022,positive,although it has many errors i had a lot of fun with the action scenes especially at the end characters like hawkman and dr fate easily attracted my attention despite being their first time on screen dwayne johnson really manages to give his character a good backstory and a good fighting motive    this movie somehow manages to connect with the viewer although the scenes seem to pass too quickly and do not fully digest the situation the film does its job which is to entertain since after all it is a superhero movie
Oct 26 2022,positive,it seems like intentionally aggressive editing was used to keep the film under two hours  pushing the narrative so quickly undoubtedly left some plot and explanation on the cutting room floor  but even with that issue the movie was an enjoyable watch start to finish  well cast in all roles  the rock is a top notch action hero  better than anything marvel has delivered since end game  ill see it again
Oct 26 2022,positive,loved it its refreshing in the midst of so many woke movies
Oct 26 2022,positive,a fun movie with high battles and iconic characters i super recommend watching it in theaters without a doubt 
Oct 26 2022,positive,i wanted to like this movie but couldnt get past my dislike of a few characters and the story the characters i liked include black adam doctor fate cyclone and the mom  kid the characters that i disliked were hawkman atom smasher and sabbac overly cgid the story at times didnt make sense not knowing that the justice society predates the justice league felt like a cheap group of 2nd rate characters i get they are trying to introduce more dc characters but i had never heard of the justice society and was asking myself why it wasnt justice league and if this was made up hawkmans logic against adam seemed unwarranted especially when the mom explains how he is freeing the city from their oppressors atom smasher was a waste too terrible actor for the role my daughters knew him from other projects and said he was a douche too the last thing i had an issue with was first them putting him at the black site storage facility and the story making him wait to say the magic word to transform him back logic would have him rip off the mask as soon as he popped out of containment i kept wondering why he wasnt ripping off the mask just lazy writing of the script i would love to see the feedback from the screening groups or the discussion with the storyboards they are lucky the rock was in this and lucky it was 5 tuesday movie night at my local theater or the rating could have been worse
Oct 26 2022,positive,not the smartest or most nuanced superhero movie but it had great action amazing effects and a pretty simple easy to enjoy good vs evil conflict definitely recommend it youre looking for a popcorn flick
Oct 26 2022,positive,absolutely loved it black adam couldve been a little less sympathetic and meaner but i understand their need to have the main character appeal at least a little bit to general audiences but i think thanos infinity war model wouldve done well here love the direction loved the jsa thank you dwayne johnson for saving dc
Oct 26 2022,positive,best movie action on high level
Oct 26 2022,positive,i am big fan of dwayneand i feel so much proud of him  polish and netral  just wearing an amizing charecters of black adam    justice society amizing castmake me feel curious thats i talk abouti want ee more    cgi excellent  sound trouck good enoughnothing old fashion and clichê  really   my best movie of dc  its wonder woman 1  but black adam give th feeling that now  dc have a begininng  of history line  welcome to magician era  i want see war of dc and marvel kk  kiddinlol we are the luck person
Oct 26 2022,positive,dont listen to these critics that get paid by disney to trash dc movies black adam is by far better than anything put out by marvel in 2022 my only gripe is the cgi for sabac could have been better
Oct 26 2022,positive,it fulfills what a film of this type must fulfill a lot of action funny scenes light humor and the hero looks great it is made for the action fan not for the movie critics who see everything with the critical eye of the oscars
Oct 26 2022,positive,ok being totally upfront im a huge dc comic span overall i really like this movie and plan on going back to see it a second time what is the plot and character development perfect no i would like to see more backgroundflushing out done on dr fatehawkman  atomcyclone  i absolutely loved all the action from beginning to end looking forward to seeing black adam vs shazam in the future
Oct 26 2022,positive,movie was great definitely one of the better dc movies obviously it has some problems but nothing to bring the movie down i saw black adam not the rock i was getting tired of seeing the rocks face in a lot of movies but he played the role really well for what it was it did good better than some of the things marvel is putting out recently and goes outside the normal super hero movie
Oct 26 2022,positive,great cgi and gives dc a new direction it is a step in the right direction and topped off with a great cameo to really get the fans excited about the future ahead
Oct 26 2022,positive,it changed the hierarchy of power in the dc universe
Oct 26 2022,positive,after a long time a very good superhero movie appeared it really has everything a comic book hero fan wants in a movie without a doubt one of the best superhero movies
Oct 26 2022,positive,black adam is fun there isnt really else positive to say if youre not and youre looking for something more need not apply the story is very thin this movie moves at a breakneck speed with minimal character establishment development or depth there are some moments where the editingcuts is extremely rapid and jarring not during action scenes which makes it stick out more there is so much action overload through the movie that it becomes somewhat boring however the visual noise is extremely entertaining when it does work i wish it couldve capitalized on some of the story beats and ideas that it had i know it sounds like theres a lot going against this film but the sum of all the parts still make this an enjoyable film if youre an action or comic book movie fan you might like this one
Oct 26 2022,positive,loved it did exactly what it promised
Oct 26 2022,positive,they gave the fans what they wanted im not into the universe so i had my friends explain to me during the movie and to understand it its a very well done movie they brought what the fans wanted and the critics do not represent majority of viewers in truth they seem out of touch
Oct 26 2022,positive,i really liked it best super hero movie in a while it was action packed it wasnt pushing a message it just was a good story and one of those super hero movies that has stakes i feel like it exists within its own universe doesnt feel like the recent marvel garbage that is aware of the audience watching it
Oct 26 2022,positive,action all the way through the kid and hawk were a little bit annoying but overall i enjoyed the movie
Oct 26 2022,positive,i liked the special effects and all the characters how shazam  played into the story was a bit confusing as how did we go from black adam to the recent shazam movie
Oct 26 2022,positive,great movie  im excited for the future of dc now that the balance of power has somewhat been shifted black adam is 5050 depending on the benefit of khandar
Oct 26 2022,positive,movie is amazing go see it most reviewers now days are mostly bought by companies
Oct 26 2022,positive,one of the best films this year
Oct 26 2022,positive,great movie and the vfx is looking good
Oct 26 2022,positive,i recommend to watch this movie specially in theaters we might enjoy that type of movies in big screen and crowd of people it is a movie that excites the actions scenes and are very  close to comic books atmosphere   dwayne johnson pierce brosnan are perfect in their roles this is a super hero movie so we cannot expect a drama it is perfect to enjoy all family members besides of blood images which i think are in mood with what we expect adults and chids  thank you dwayne for bringing that type of movie and moreover to bring people to cinema theaters that i think is really necessary in this streaming era
Oct 26 2022,positive,this was so refreshing what a great old school action flick with none of the preachy nonsense
Oct 26 2022,positive,take a few characters out and we would have a action pack movie with a better story great to see dc back on track
Oct 26 2022,positive,the cgi effects was awesome and the action was great throughout the movie it wasnt boring
Oct 26 2022,positive,movie is really good the action the entertainmentthe stunning visual is really good though the story is predictable and some maynot like in terms of story u cant really complain about other things for me it was a entertaining ride
Oct 26 2022,positive,this movie is the perfect example of what could have been if hamada would continue to run dc and wb he is a sellout movie had my son glued to the chair probably likes the rock more than i do dr fate is by far the best wizard and hawkman story needs a visionary like zack but i couldve expected worse under the old regime  hope is coming  restorethesnyderverse
Oct 26 2022,positive,dwayne johnson was awesome alot of action a thrill ride
Oct 26 2022,positive,this was a great time and i left with no regrets for spending my time and money on this fine flick of course there is some super hero cheese at times it is what it is highly recommended
Oct 26 2022,positive,an adrenaline rush movie
Oct 26 2022,positive,great movie story wise effects love the after credits reveal
Oct 26 2022,positive,awesome movie great ending if you know what i mean glad the audience loved it clear sign of critic these days being either bias or having an agender lol
Oct 26 2022,positive,i love the character that dwyane played i disliked the character of the hawk he seemed so self righteous and determined to lock up the hero
Oct 26 2022,positive,everything you want from an action movie action and fun no propaganda no woke nonsense well done dc i hope to see more movies like this my kids love it
Oct 26 2022,positive,it is action packed and i really enjoyed the movie
Oct 26 2022,positive,the movie itself is pretty okay but for me is that the movie doesnt give me any hype the plot is just adam saving his city and sometimes hes just full of himself i dont if this movie giving me any vibe but sometime its giving a laugh and just went back to a stiff atmosphere this movie is giving a random and confusing thing to me like theres the part when atom and cyclone just randomly talk that how cool the other are and then the part the kid do funny stuff maybe it just me but i give a 3 out of 5 it give you a light humor while the intense fight happening overall it the movie is balance i recommend you watch it if you dont have any choice of movie for now
Oct 26 2022,positive,i just back from seeing black adam and i will say that it was way better than i expected i guess im drawn to this movie because there hasnt been a giant blockbuster movie in a month or two and my boredom has been taken away with this film black adam is a surprisingly funny movie like actually funny the side characters are also really good and while the plot is dumb and the script is rough i genuinely had a good time with this movie atom smasher and the wind girl i dont member her name were both really good entries to the film and they actually had chemistry despite their limited screen time the dialogue is bad but the majority of the actors are really good so you dont even notice with the exception of the child actor who is just exceptionally bad its not his fault because hes a child being forced to do an accent but it did get really distracting at times it was better than i thought 710
Oct 26 2022,positive,this movie was absolutely amazing 
Oct 26 2022,positive,this movie was amazing  rotten tomatoes critics should be ashamed and let go because they cant see a good film there very bias with disney and mcu films and give poor reviews to dc films the true critics is the audience not so called professionals just look at the comparisons there worlds apart dont trust the critics here and watch the movie and judge yourself
Oct 26 2022,negative,the first move thought i had leaving the movie was well that was a waste i am a comic book fan so my filter is different than most moviegoers but this movie was disjointed and collect any sort of depth whats even more frustrating is the fact that marvel does such a good job with every character they have in their universe this movie contained acting that was lifeless and the tropes were annoying i dont know why dc cant think of cool villains and defaults to these demonic forces with wizards its almost as if i wont see a dc movie unless it contains batman joker or the suicide squad bring back green lantern
Oct 26 2022,positive,great action and graphics
Oct 26 2022,positive,i really dont understand why it has such a low rating with reviewers i enjoyed this movie more than most of the other dc movies i highly enjoyed dr fate he was an amazing addition i enjoyed the struggle between good and bad i much preferred the bad side but overall i enjoyed it i hope this pushes dc in a better direction
Oct 26 2022,positive,best dcu movie so far action scenes were just mindblowing and critics rating are fake go and watched it for yourself you will love it
Oct 26 2022,positive,awesome movie action all the way thru
Oct 26 2022,positive,fantastic movie sorry dc people but besides wonder woman  aquaman dc movies usually suck i dont even go see them anymore but i read that the rock was directing and mannnn did he do an amazing job
Oct 26 2022,positive,while the writing acting and directing was a bit all over the place the movie is still a ton of fun and a good time at the movie theater  found some parts to be very funny as well  the action on this movie is spectacular and something you want to see on the big screen
Oct 26 2022,negative,its visually awesome but its super boring
Oct 26 2022,positive,good move with a lot of action
Oct 26 2022,positive,a delightful dc movie finally giving us what we want in the dcverse
Oct 26 2022,positive,movie is weak was to see it just for henry
Oct 26 2022,neutral,its interesting how the foreign oppressors conveniently have british accents yeah sure mate
Oct 26 2022,positive,absolutely amazing first time in a while ive been able to enjoy a movie without wokeness being shoved down my neck
Oct 26 2022,positive,game changer constant hit from casting and portrayal of doctor fate cyclone hawkman atom smasher to waller to mid credit scene to the rocks take on black adam himself to a film finally addressing how heroes of ignored the struggles of certain culturesethnic groups to the balance of action comedy and scifi    black adam has reignited the spark havent been felt since arguably man of steel and snyder cut jl dceu salvaged with new hope
Oct 26 2022,positive,absolutely awesome movie 1010
Oct 26 2022,positive,best superhero movie since ironman died
Oct 26 2022,positive,best dcu movie so far definitely want to watch more from dc
Oct 26 2022,positive,action good but story hard to understand
Oct 26 2022,positive,one of the best dc movies honestly they definitely connect the universe at the end
Oct 26 2022,positive,its a great movie i wish you could have applied the two duo kevin hart and dwayne johnson to bring in what they do best together it got the drama but ill rate it 810 go big dwayne johnson my idle make me proud champ black adam i recommend to be watched
Oct 26 2022,positive,not a perfect movie but a huge step in the right direction the rock has given dc fans hope at the end of the day thats all anyone can ask for
Oct 26 2022,neutral,its okay at best most of the action scenes are mind numbing at best the protagonist is also extremely one dimensional and i wished he changed more during the movie or somehow showed a different side to the character overall the movie is entertaining and i didnt feel disappointed neither satisfied the movie comes packing with action scenes with the insane over use of slow motion effects but it could be good fun depending on your take
Oct 26 2022,positive,the kids liked it a little too difficult for me to keep up they explained most of it to me on the way home
Oct 26 2022,positive,great worth a watch
Oct 26 2022,positive,nonstop action phenomenal visual effects and solid movie from start to finish
Oct 26 2022,positive,the dc this time did deliver the only downside was the cgi of the main villain but still 5 stars
Oct 26 2022,positive,my son thought the movie was so cool
Oct 26 2022,positive,entertaining good plot amazing action if you like dc movies this is not bad
Oct 26 2022,negative,i love the rock and i love superhero movies but this was not a good movie
Oct 26 2022,positive,for me this is much better than she hulk but why rotten tomatoes give so high rating for she hulk and for black addam they give so low rating   if rotten tomatoes read this please answer me why do you hate black addam or marvel pay you to make their movie great   answer me please
Oct 26 2022,positive,really liked this movie id go see it again different tone with the more realistic antihero enjoyable
Oct 26 2022,positive,honestly i thought the movie was going to be kinda boring judging by the tomato scores but after going to see it i can for sure recommend this to anyone trying to see a lot of action scenes and much more 9710
Oct 26 2022,positive,rottentomatoes critics have lost their mind how can you possibly rate movies such as morbius thor love and thunder and shehulk so much higher than black adam my take is that go watch the movie in theatres the fan ratings aint lying it is a damn great movie watch it on the big screen
Oct 26 2022,negative,i dont get it why they have to put the kid as a main purpose for black adam to goes action
Oct 26 2022,positive,ive often wondered if the fact that rt and marvel being owned by the same people lead to the bad reviews from critics but black adam did a great job of introducing a character building suspense and showing a connection to the wider world brosnan is great the cyclone effects are a joy to look at smasher is pleasantly fun johnson plays a very johnson character but in this case it works the character was asked for introspection only after he was given powers a mix that doesnt make for personal growth fun action shout outs to book fans fun engagement
Oct 26 2022,positive,thoroughly entertaining movie
Oct 26 2022,positive,the story line was perfect not too much going on but kept us interested and on the edge of our seats
Oct 26 2022,positive,even its lack of stories this film still worth it to watch as a popcorn movie
Oct 26 2022,neutral,if you know nothing of the dc universe then you will have no clue whats going on poorly told story poorly paced the actors did there best to make this film feel better then it really is simply put if the rock wasnt in this film then this would be a big flop the actors tried and its not there fault average at best
Oct 26 2022,positive,great movie which steps away from the typical formula quite refreshing the 2hr runtime feels too short i mean that as a positive would watch again
Oct 26 2022,positive,awesome movie great fighting scenes
Oct 26 2022,positive,this movie is great  it explores that who we see as heroes is all a matter of perspective
Oct 26 2022,positive,best dc movie in the modern era which isnt saying much i know this movie was flawed but a very enjoyable watch there is hope on the horizon for the dc universe if they keep the fun aspect a part of their formula
Oct 26 2022,positive,amazing movie you should definetly watch it
Oct 26 2022,positive,an all around awesome movie worth seeing again
Oct 26 2022,positive,i thought the movie was fairly great the villain was fairly terrible some of the characters decisions and motives were questionable     the movie was a great mindlessly entertaining action movie
Oct 26 2022,positive,dont believe critic they all act high and mighty like they can tell what good for you but it isnt its really fun action movie that not focus much on storyif you are not nitpicking smartass this movie really fun to watch
Oct 26 2022,positive,i saw 2 time and is too perfect
Oct 26 2022,positive,was a solid start introducing the audience to a character that a lot of the movie going audience likely didnt know much about going in seemed a but cheesy and too cliche at the end but overall the action and dash of comedy here and there make it a fun watch for those who dont take things overly seriously
Oct 26 2022,positive,movie in general was best dc made as it set a new phase of dc universe which we all were waiting for hats off
Oct 26 2022,positive,blockbuster  no but on line with dceu core movies  worth watchingdefinitely with actionpack  storylinemediumpressive
Oct 26 2022,positive,it starts out a bit slow with the partial backstory you get the most important part of the back story closer to the end but soon goes full throttle with the action the story is ok not great but not exceedingly terrible in conclusion if you want a fun actionpacked movie this one is definitely the one to watch
Oct 26 2022,positive,amazing so much fun critics are completely wrong
Oct 26 2022,positive,a nonstop action pack all the cast born to be their characters dwayne johnson will bring dceu to the new era well done
Oct 26 2022,positive,i think its a good movie to watch it reminds me of classic actionpacked superhero movies thank god the cgi fight scenes arent at night so they can be seen properly instead of blurry shadows  its a correct starting point for the dc universe
Oct 26 2022,positive,best dwayne johnson movie i ever watched the plot was simple but you will never feel bored
Oct 26 2022,positive,i really enjoyed this movie johnson always has a specific role he plays in movies and this felt like a different role for him brosnan and hodge crushed it i was very happy with the storyline they did a great job telling the story and nothing felt rushed i honestly didnt have any complaints about this movie except for one scene where i felt it was not as bold as it needed to be the cherry on top was the credit scene that literally made my year
Oct 26 2022,positive,really awesome experience the rock protrays a great heroyes i said it that allthough somewhat edgy and unnapollogenyc tends to mellow twards the end the fights are well coreografed and the dialogues are on point all the main actors are well competent in their roles and they deffinetly bought their a game for this movie all in all a great experience that leaves little to be wanted more from a movie of this genre    ps apparently the lack of pollitical messages made this not a cup of tea for the critics but you cant please them all
Oct 26 2022,positive,superhero movies are not dead yet
Oct 26 2022,positive,a genuinely fun time
Oct 26 2022,positive,i liked the story and the characters in it i also enjoyed the special effects and costumes for all characters i would see it again
Oct 26 2022,positive,entertaining to say the least

Oct 26 2022,positive,ive never had so much fun watching a pretty bad movie the fun outweighs the bad 4 out of 5 stars 
Oct 26 2022,positive,spoiler free review great writing great story great directing great acting terrible film editing i challenge anyone who watches the movie to count seconds between sceneview changes you wont be able to count on both hands how many scenes lasted 10 seconds throughout the entire movie because of this the movie seems rushed comedy doesnt hit right and character investment isnt there if they would have added 13 seconds each cut scene camera view this movie would have hit completely different 
Oct 26 2022,positive,the rock was born for this role great movie i absolutely loved it i plan on seeing it again thank you rock
Oct 26 2022,positive,everything a superhero movie should be looking forwards the new shazam movie

Oct 26 2022,positive,starts really slow but ends really great very entertaining stay for the credits teaser 
Oct 26 2022,positive,one of the finest dc movies after a while  dwayne at his best caliber carried the entire movie on his shoulders the bgm is awesome and it gives slight resemblance of moon knight theme worth watching in theater and trust me you wont check your watch or mobile in between its intense from beginning to end with some fun loving conversations between jsa and dwayne
Oct 26 2022,positive,i like the humorous moments it was easy to follow the story line dwayne johnson played his character with the emphasis and emotion that fit perfectly with his part i didnt like some of the story being very predictable i told my adult children they have to see this movie
Oct 26 2022,neutral,this movie had so much going for it may u add it had the rock himself an actor known for his great delivery and comedy strengths i didnt feel like the directors really utilized or at least to the extent they should have they also had some great side characters they focused so much on the main guy who to be honest also had minimal development at best they forgot they had such great side characters that could  have truly developed and come in to thare own but they didnt really develop at all after this movie was over i could think of meny ways to fix the storys problems none of which i will   list in order to keep this review spoiler free i do advise you to come up woth some of your own however this move did have some pros too it had side carecters that had lots of potential  it has great lore and kick but action that leves you with suspence over all it kept me well intertaind but it didnt really leave me with anything or longing for more in recent years it apperes they are trying to be too much like thare competition and less of what made dc great in the first place thare is a reason why the cw shows  are so intertertaining and that is becuse it feels like its own thing not just some cheep carbon nock off of something else dc needs to go back to its roots and re discover  its self you can not win  a war be being yiur competitors you win a war  by being your self this is somthing we learn from every superhero film and of witch  the perducton team of this film should remind them selves of

Oct 26 2022,positive,best movie i have ever seen the plot was incredibly thought out and came to life like i have never seen in a movie before the acting was phenomenal with a lot of big names i was terrified the actors would struggle to play the characters we love and not the characters theyre used to but not only did they met expectations they destroyed them i have never seen a more accurate portrayal of a superhero in my entire life nor such an accurate portrayal of what heroes mean to different people and how war and peace affects different communities who have suffered because of both it was real and magical and hilarious and so ridiculously sad that i cried once out of pity and another of absolute wonder best superhero movie i have ever seen 1010

Oct 26 2022,negative,i can understand the movie being entertaining especially the fight scenes  other than that though this movie felt like no effort was made into the characters or the story besides dr fate it was very bland with focus shifting everywhere on top of not laying out ground work for things that happen i cannot believe this audience score as everyone ive heard review this in real life has thought the same this movie is average at best and only elevated by its actionvfx scenes which are great at times but the rest of it acting for example is awful

Oct 25 2022,positive,love the spin on how not all heroes come from a happy background

Oct 25 2022,positive,the critics really dont know what they are talking about they see the name dc and just hate on it before they even see it but this movie is great
Oct 25 2022,positive,great watch plenty of spectacle doesnt take itself too seriously  the main villain is weak but the movie is really about who the main character is going to be in the world he is in anyway
Oct 25 2022,positive,this movie is cool actionpacked and funny it kept me up even though most movies make me fall asleep
Oct 25 2022,positive,the criticism of this movie is ridiculous its one the best films from dc a must watch and having the rock is always a plus
Oct 25 2022,positive,the most fun youll have at the movies
Oct 25 2022,positive,lots of great action with some heroes and antiheroes you can take seriously for a change some story elements and acting a bit shallow but other than that the rock and co did a really great job bringing his version of the dc universe to life
Oct 25 2022,positive,fun and entertaining would definitely say i enjoyed it
Oct 25 2022,positive,there were a couple moments where the story got slow but man was it a good time the rock was bad ass action  fight sequences were entertaining
Oct 25 2022,positive,the rock brought a fresh perspective to the dceu and blew me away this film was fantastic loved every minute of it this is what dc movies should be easily the best of any of the dc offerings over the last several years  hopefully this breathes new life into the dceu thank god the old regime is out and now maybe we can get movies as good as the mcu offerings  thank you for bringing back superman cavil is the best person to play superman
Oct 25 2022,positive,the best movie dwayne johnson has done in a long time it gives a spark to the dc universe that it has long been waiting for great spfx and  visual effects a must see
Oct 25 2022,positive,one of the best movies out there we need more movies like this dark and powerfull unlike marvel movies which has comedy and fuckery every 2 seconds
Oct 25 2022,positive,waiting for the sequel
Oct 25 2022,neutral,it was meh ok but my god the skater boy character was soooo annoying the whole film hawk man and dr fate were awesome in my opinion those two characters held this film together 
Oct 25 2022,positive,the rock is absolutely stunning in this movie plot and story are ok could be better the critics are just dumb go see that movie
Oct 25 2022,neutral,typical marvel movie same plot different actors one plus is the rock is always awesome

Oct 25 2022,positive,had a good amount of action glad we got rid of the stereotype that around superheroes and going with something new
Oct 25 2022,positive,good fun movie and the critics are nothing but haters
Oct 25 2022,positive,one more example of how critics make mistakes or manipulate the audience conditioning us negatively in favor of their interests or the best payer we decided to see it and evaluate it for ourselves and i have to say that we have really enjoyed the film and this superhero who has kept us attentive to the screen throughout the film the film contains great fight scenes with good special effects a dwayne johnson really committed to his character and honoring his worth and a hero of a greatness only comparable to superman finally the postcredits scene has excited us and left us wanting more dc and to see both of them in action again in the very near future
Oct 25 2022,positive,edge of your seat action
Oct 25 2022,positive,the special effects are worth the watch plot and story development was unique but somewhat confusing and unsatisfying the rockdrfatedeathdestruction what more do you want there were 1010 moments worth the price of admission
Oct 25 2022,positive,definitely alot of action decent storyline very imaginative

Oct 25 2022,positive,my father and i really enjoyed the movie dwayne johnson was a perfect match for his role would love to see it again
Oct 25 2022,positive,this movie is a good time the box office is starving for entertainment as usual the rock delivers its an action movie not a philosophical depiction of life go enjoy it and go on with life its worth even a second watch and great for a date night yes im a comic fan and comic illustrator i dont pledge allegiance to any particular camp i judge individually and if this wasnt a comic movie id still enjoy watching it more entertaining than most movies this year so far i celebrate the fact we have comic movies period we are living in times i only dreamed of as a kid
Oct 25 2022,positive,loved it very good movie
Oct 25 2022,negative,youd think a wrestling star would translate over to superhero fairly painlessly but nope
Oct 25 2022,positive,this movie is exactly what i go to the movies to see something that is entertaining and diverting  its great to be able to forget about my problems for a couple of hours
Oct 25 2022,positive,better storyline than what i thought
Oct 25 2022,positive,this film is a breath of fresh air a return to super hero films of old i recommend watching it

Oct 25 2022,negative,man this was bad no compelling story characters so 2 dimensional and just felt like a pain watching it
Oct 25 2022,positive,there are a lot of glaring shortcomings and some questionable story choices but for a comic book movie it checks all the boxes leave common sense at the door and youll have a good time
Oct 25 2022,positive,maybe the best dc comic movie to date
Oct 25 2022,positive,the early critical reviews did not stop me from seeing the movie in its opening weekend and i was not disappointed it does for me what antihero movie suppose to do mix some bad with some good   from the opening scene i was entertained by great action scenes and the plotstoryline was acceptable it brought my emotions into the movie   overall i would recommend this movie as a must see i am plan on seeing it again to pick up on all the eastereggs i missed the first time around
Oct 25 2022,positive,great movie if you like superhero movies   critics have no idea
Oct 25 2022,positive,enjoyable action and average story nothing special but sets up exciting possibilities for the future

Oct 25 2022,positive,totally entertaining
Oct 25 2022,neutral,enjoyable but struggles to make a big decisions in the plot and just drags on way too long
Oct 25 2022,negative,nonsense and boring dumbed down writersproducers et al hollyweirds in cali  ga elsewheresmh
Oct 25 2022,positive,not perfect but its a fun watch with plenty of action some unnecessary things here and there but it seems to balance itsself out
Oct 25 2022,positive,some parts were a little corny but there was tons of action
Oct 25 2022,positive,got everything and more that i expected rock is phenomenon yes but i loved more hawkman  never expected that  great characters hoping to see carter al and maxine again

Oct 25 2022,positive,great fun i mean it has the rock and pierce brosnan i really enjoyed the story and the special effects were quite well done i like the justice society and think it will allow dc to really branch out into interesting stories since this film tied to both the justic leage and suicide squad films well done
Oct 25 2022,negative,the script would be better if the ai wrote it there are meaningless conversations with the support of never ending music only one time it stopped when adam said i do cool
Oct 25 2022,negative,everything that is wrong with cinema today awful terrible waste of 2 hours we seemed to have lost the art of storytelling at the cinema
Oct 25 2022,positive,best movie of 2022 
Oct 25 2022,positive,fun movie not shakespeare but most dc movie i liked the twist
Oct 25 2022,positive,going a second time i had many many doubts on this but was pleasantly surprised at how it was handled really good action a simple story to follow with a nice twist not entirely message free but i actually like what was pointed out this movie went in a slightly different direction and i appreciate that easy and fun to watch definitely not a waste of time highly recommend if you just want to enjoy an action pack movie with a simple plot to enjoy
Oct 25 2022,positive,great movie  action packed and the rock didnt disappoint
Oct 25 2022,positive,i really expected more from this movie i didnt really relate to the plot until the middle of the movie was worth seeing but definitely not one of my favorites
Oct 25 2022,positive,carnage done well dwayne johnson doesnt hurt either
Oct 25 2022,negative,more killing and eyebrow raising than needed its a superhero film about a villain im going to stick with the marvel movies at least theyre entertaining for children this wasnt even good the senseless killing was unnecessary
Oct 25 2022,positive,phenomenal movie with loads and loads of action an absolute treat for the fans however it is a bit far from perfect ill say  they do kill off a certain character in the movie which was utterly and completely unnecessary you dont just introduce a character and kill em off in one spinoff i feel that was the only let down but if you set that aside oml that was frickin awesome freaking guns blazing mayhem everywhere i for one had an amazing time
Oct 25 2022,positive,it was refreshing entertaining and exciting with a fulfilling ending  thank you the rock
Oct 25 2022,positive,excellent superhero movie  nothing else to say its not a tarkovsky it kept me in and engaged with the action and this is all i ask from this kind of movie 
Oct 25 2022,positive,i thought it was good and a fun movie  dont listen to those that say it was t a good movie
Oct 25 2022,positive,probably the best movie that has been released in 2022 i have no clue why it has a 39 tomatometer rating
Oct 25 2022,positive,this movie is amazing it is a superhero movie but it is the pinnacle of what superhero movies are the action is fun characters and setting are interesting and new and the pacing is great in general the story will probably go the way you expect but it will take you many places you wouldnt consider as well   being a superhero movie they dont go into depth on some of the interesting themes but they do much more than your average movie on presenting and exploring interesting concepts characters who see the world completely different go head to head and you as the viewer are left to decide who is right  this movie made me excited to see what dc has planned next dc has just won a fan
Oct 25 2022,positive,good fun and special effect are at a lot higher level than dc lately welcome back henry cavill i hope
Oct 25 2022,positive,i loved this movie probably one of my new favorite for the dc universe
Oct 25 2022,positive,great movie with amazing fight scenes and 1010 music selection
Oct 25 2022,positive,amazing this shows that dc has a better future than marvel good cgi actual story and compelling chat stuff that modern marvel fails to have definitely recommend
Oct 25 2022,positive,simple story good action like back to the old super hero movies so glad to see superman back
Oct 25 2022,positive,lots of action and really like the rock
Oct 25 2022,positive,brilliant film exactly what i wanted thrills entertainment engaging and building characters in a tough comic book world without spending hours looking at back story    well done too marks
Oct 25 2022,positive,the film allows for a fun and exciting experience you can watch scenes without fear that will generate embarrassment and shame violence humor and plot in the right measure for the indicated classification
Oct 25 2022,positive,i love it stay until the end post credits

Oct 25 2022,positive,really fun good movie the fight scene are amazing
Oct 25 2022,positive,not sure of the hate here this is a fine popcorn movie and i was entertained  just watch it for yourself
Oct 25 2022,positive,it is a visual spectacle wellcrafted and careful special effects wellcoordinated and brutal action  the script is a weak aspect since it goes from the epic of the past to the rare of the present focusing on the character of the child the jsa is an aspect to highlight they have an incredible presence it is a pleasant movie and to pass the time with the plus that you find yourself apart from the dc bible it is not perfect but it is a great step to what follows and especially with that scene  postcreditos
Oct 25 2022,positive,good action flick hope to see more along these lines hopefully theyll start getting to dc stuff right and warner discovery
Oct 25 2022,positive,great movie from beginning to end very entertaining great step moving forward for dceu

Oct 25 2022,neutral,very one level the whole time didnt really give any variance
Oct 25 2022,neutral,if you like action this movie is for you because this is the only thing the movie is good at
Oct 25 2022,positive,a perfect family entertainment i will not hesitate to watch this again its neither dragon ball super superhero which is a charming intoxicated overthetop makes you laugh effortlessly by its humor and with some brilliant characterization nor its shangchi which had expand its world the stakes will higher and you can feel the human connection all with beautiful cinematography  visuals its not both of them but still its enjoyable because its the effort of dwayne the rock johnson  team
Oct 25 2022,positive,the movie is awesome and i would like to see it again
Oct 25 2022,positive,great movie started out slow but picked up fast
Oct 25 2022,positive,best dc movie to date imo   yes there is plenty of marvel parallels like in the comics and yes you can tell that they are trying again to set up their dcu with this film but the film was still good  very entertaining
Oct 25 2022,positive,a fun superhero movie that is a definite plus in the right direction for dc
Oct 25 2022,positive,a great throwback to the 90s superhero movies like the shadow and the crow     i just want films like this to be fun and entertaining pulp movie making     i enjoyed seeing the rock being a proper character as well he is more capable than he thinks love the good  the bad and the ugly sequence
Oct 25 2022,positive,awesome i didnt expect anything of this movie but in the end i was surprised
Oct 25 2022,positive,action packed from start to finish
Oct 25 2022,positive,classic example of an awesome movie and the critics being boring and trying to find flaws
Oct 25 2022,positive,while the story is a little choppy and adhdish  entertainment wise this flick delivers fun action and great pacing make this choppy story watchable was fun to see the rock in this kind of role hopefully next flick the screenplay will be a little more cohesive one bad thing a couple of the actors were awful most notably the admiral and his actions were odd towards the end of the flick give it a try its certainly not boring  hi henry c
Oct 25 2022,positive,movie goes so hard dont pay attention to tomato meter

Oct 25 2022,positive,a real hero movie just like that
Oct 25 2022,positive,its your safe super hero movie i personally have nothing too bad to say only real one that some characters felt they had no really weight to the story and if they were taken out the movie it would have played out almost the same way the two im talking about are cyclone and atom smasher over all i thought it was a fun and enjoyable movie i would recommend it

Oct 25 2022,positive,it was an awesome movie and i would recommend it
Oct 25 2022,positive,surprisingly fun show seems movies of this type are made for the generic widest audience possible which means everyone that sees it says meh instead of a large group being excited to see it again    this one is more the later though i have to say pierce brosnan steals every scene i find it really bizarre though that bas nemesis was nowhere in it billys shazam should have been there somewhere
Oct 25 2022,positive,didnt expect much when i accidentally saw ign review of 510 went to the cinema and saw it today it was a blast it was great and it didnt dissapoint at all

Oct 25 2022,positive,excellent movie i liked the unbridled action the effects are great and as an antihero its great
Oct 25 2022,neutral,its fine but far from great its like a mix between terminator 2 the mummy 1999  and yet another generic superhero movie that somehow works i get why critics dont like it but it feels like it doesnt care at all because it was made for superhero movie fans action movie fans and the rock fans
Oct 25 2022,positive,its the best movie superheros last 2 years
Oct 25 2022,positive,great movie finally warnerdc get one right loved seeing the jsa just wish they had a few more heroes in the movie with them my friend is a marvel fan and he liked it too id say if they follow this track then warnerdc will do well dc needs a few more hits under its belt go see it

Oct 25 2022,positive,the batman was better
Oct 25 2022,positive,it was a very fun comic book movie  i dont understand the critics being so harsh about it  its not an oscar winner its a comic book film  i plan on seeing it in theaters at least once more
Oct 25 2022,negative,horrible but flashy at best im not even sure dc can put its logo on it with the bad changes they made  dr fates changes irk me the most they destroyed the character  this movie could literally be called a spoof to dc in general
Oct 25 2022,positive,it is completely a rock one man show with   a fans expected climax and post credit scene
Oct 25 2022,positive,the best dc movie so far will go see it again in all its glory on the big screen  this is just another reason on why i dont pay attention to critics
Oct 25 2022,positive,the movie was entertaining  cringingly corny a few times  and definitely written for children  not bad  not great  but worth it to kill time with the family
Oct 25 2022,positive,great fill very entertaining and very good special effects

Oct 25 2022,positive,super fun had some twists that kept the audience guessing lots of comedy relief special effects and cgi were amazing
Oct 25 2022,positive,dont ever trust critics reviews see it for yourself  of course the movie is not a 1010 but its a good superhero movie the freaking 39 is outrageous
Oct 25 2022,positive,brilliant film huge rematch value cant wait to own a copy
Oct 25 2022,positive,this film is awesome and a must see one fun is all that matters and it delivers lots and lots of fun to audience those specialist critics are just showing to public they dont know how to evaluate or watch a superhero movie anymore since forever
Oct 25 2022,negative,the good it a spectacle of cgi effects and cool fights  the bad everything else    every plot device serves only to tie action sequences together which may be fine for some who only care about spectacle and nothing else however after 15 years of development i expected more than a half assed script that feels as though they cobbled it together at the last minute
Oct 25 2022,positive,dwayne brings everything we were waiting for
Oct 25 2022,positive,the absolute best superhero movie ive ever seenthe best the rock is perfect for this role and is the only person in hollywood that actually looks like a superhero in real life acting was perfect humor was hilarious in 40 yrs of movies this is the first movie that made me create an account on this site just to leave a review amazing amazing amazing
Oct 25 2022,positive,great action packed movie humor when needed but not too much a great new addition to the dceu
Oct 25 2022,positive,really good a lot of fun    39 critic aggregate really way to lose your credibility aye dont know what they were smoking or what film they watched but yea pretty obvious to see their low scores are politically driven     so yea ignore them go see the film for your self its not perfect but its just a lot of fun
Oct 25 2022,positive,one of best dc movies  in years thank you dwayne alot of action and a good story  im hyped for the future and exited about henry and bens return to the dc extended universe 
Oct 25 2022,positive,fun hero movie excellent special effects far superior to the latest marvel productions
Oct 25 2022,positive,the action so good really loved the story its fun watch it
Oct 25 2022,positive,light on the story sure but then again i have no qualms about watching the rock shock and tear people in half a gritty uncaring antihero who brutally ends his opponents a much needed break from the usual superhero movie with the mid dialogue cringey jokes and the same movie format thats been around for the past decade
Oct 25 2022,positive,best action movie of 2022
Oct 25 2022,positive,this is what we called a superheroes movie

Oct 25 2022,positive,great movie with good charactersdr fate is best character rest of them are good but not great amazing action with great cgistory is ok but it can get you through the movie
Oct 25 2022,negative,that movie was dumb only served to enshrine the rocks ego and nothing else saviour of the people pleasethe big flashy action sequences were not enough for me to appreciate this movie   how did amanda waller become affiliated with the jsa where were they before all this there are no efforts to link anything up  what about the actual villain sabac an all powerful creature powered by several demons 5 minutes of screen time which only showed it as a punching bag rather than a credible threat   the whole thing was dumb egotistical mess if the rock took 15 years to put this together lord have mercy on our souls for what hes cooking next
Oct 25 2022,positive,it was definitely amazing a must see this has been in the making a long time but absolutely worth the wait
Oct 25 2022,positive,good needed more story details
Oct 25 2022,positive,finally a superhero movie with real action
Oct 25 2022,positive,extremely action full and fun movie with a nice storyline and fun character arc one of the best dc has made so far these critics who are saying that the movie is bad are for sure paid by its competitor or otherwise incompetent
Oct 25 2022,negative,this movie was a mix of trying to be funny and trying to make the rock look like a badass the plot was almost impossible to follow with a bunch of useless characters for example the atom smasher did nothing to influence the outcome terrible script no emotion shown in regular people they only focus on the super heroes cringe worthy lines
Oct 25 2022,positive,best superhero movie in 2022 so far
Oct 25 2022,positive,this might be the best film that dc did yet the best cgi and they keep the pace up with everyone they show what feeling that everybody have
Oct 25 2022,positive,weak villain but the rock and justice society were fun to watch really liked the tone and hoping to see more
Oct 25 2022,positive,we knew exactly what we were into and we got what went for fun this is the kind of movie you go to the theaters for action packed as hell fun fun fun

Oct 25 2022,positive,a fun movie with intense fight scenes mostly flying with the charisma and grandeur of the great the rock totally worth it
Oct 25 2022,positive,absolutely loved this movie the critics are idiots great action movie and the diologue is great marvel is losing ground to dc now imo and thats not a bad thing go see this movie
Oct 25 2022,negative,another messy super hero spectacle not sure which is more annoying the mindless dialog or overly excessive and not that impressive cgi
Oct 25 2022,positive,who cares what the critics think these movies are made for the fans of dc and this is exactly what we want if the movie is making money then they are obviously doing something right
Oct 25 2022,positive,i really enjoyed watching this movie from start to finish there were some flaws but over all id say it was a 5 out of 5 for me the actors all did a wonderful job brosnan and hodge had great chemistry swindell and centineo were great man i dont know what else to say without spoiling anything but its definitely worth a watch or two ive seen it 3 times now
Oct 25 2022,positive,this movie is way better than the 40 the critics have given it i would give it a 810
Oct 25 2022,positive,my wife and i both loved it and we have different tastes in movies it has a diverse cast but it had a solid story i dont know what movie the critics saw but this is the type of movie that weve been missing for a long time
Oct 25 2022,negative,looked like the entire movie was filmed in front of a green screen and it just looks cheap and fake there was a justice league now there is a justice society hawkman is apparently industuctable he is fabulous wealthy for some reason oh and his plane is made of industuctable material to fill a plot hole lazy writing just a terrible and boring movie from start to finish
Oct 25 2022,positive,with the way things are in the world this movie is what we needed to take a break from reality and join the rock with his signature role entertaining us brilliantly
Oct 25 2022,negative,some good action sequences but mostly boring and muddled 
Oct 25 2022,positive,the movie was great it dilevered everything i was hoping for and it truly does start a new era in the dc universe especially with the return of henry as superman the rotation tomatoes critics are just haters as usual
Oct 25 2022,positive,great cgi compared to recent comic book content mcu
Oct 25 2022,positive,loved the story and the jsa one of best dc movies  in years
Oct 25 2022,positive,simple put a superhero movie fun fast with a lot of kicking asses

Oct 25 2022,positive,it was a boring story it felt like the rocks ego was the director of the movie standard dc sadly
Oct 25 2022,positive,this is what marvel wants to be mood
Oct 25 2022,positive,fun move the rock was great the dialog was a little cringey
Oct 25 2022,positive,the best part of the movie was when my mate jack screamed shazam at the top of his lungs when the pebble made his return from almost drowning or whatever that deadpool impersonator also sucked
Oct 25 2022,negative,the most memorable thing about this movie is how bad it is
Oct 25 2022,positive,oh boy  the rock is saving the dceu  good old fashioned fun times without the lecturing  refreshing    way to go dj      cameo also made my year

Oct 25 2022,positive,the criticisms of this movie are way to overblown it just came out in a time with s lit of superhero fatiguemostly thanks to disney it has great action even better cgi and the characters were very good as well a part i really love is how they tackled the flaws of the superhero concept heroes tend to go to places to help only when other supers are there even if their was a tyrant ruling the country illegaly and that some criminals wont just stay in prison and maybe even deserve execution 1010 excellent movie

Oct 25 2022,positive,great movie you can enjoy when watching it  i dont know why the score is low may be marvel fan 
Oct 25 2022,positive,the movie is definitely a non stop action superhero movie the titular character played by the rock gets a great backstory as the anti hero and finally realising hes meant to be more all the characters are well played despite the screen time being less the main antagonist could have been a little better than a cgi puppet is all i feel youll have moments of wow and cheering the rock just nailed the character   ps  the end credit scene is absolutely worth it
Oct 25 2022,positive,enjoy the movie great action sequence
Oct 25 2022,negative,started off with a bang and was ready for an awesome movie but it just fell flatstory line was poorly written and was trying hard to stay awake by the end  this made the green lantern look like a master piece

Oct 25 2022,positive,full action packed movie very entertaining what a spectacular performance from the rock aka balck adam and my personal favourite dr fate
Oct 25 2022,positive,well this movie proofs that the only score that matters now  is users score professional critics with their 40100 can go watch rings of power    2 hour of epic good jokes and amazing dwayne johnson punching guys in the face with lightning    for sure its the best superhero movie of last time
Oct 25 2022,positive,amazing movie a mustwatch this is a true superhero movie dwayne has done a phenomenal job and so did the rest of the cast i hate to say this but either the critics are stupid and biased or they dont want to promote a great movie whose main actors are people of color either way i loved every second of it and a massive thank you to the rock for bringing back superman
Oct 25 2022,positive,so this was dwaynes pet project and he kindo did some justice to the movie didnt  try to put many things in one serving made a movie for masses we enjoyed the casting esp dr fate the action scenes and vfx the inspirational kid and sabbac was the only thing which made the whole theatre  uninteresting good foundation thanks dwayne and crew
Oct 25 2022,negative,just exactly like all the movies of superheroes nothing new
Oct 25 2022,positive,great film originally shazam superhero sold more comic books than superman this shows you the potential black adam could have if continues considering black adam is a dark cooler version of shazam

Oct 25 2022,positive,loved the action it was great
Oct 25 2022,positive,great movie must be seen too bad critics dont know a good movie when they see it 
Oct 25 2022,positive,very enjoyable movie with great character development despite the abundance of secondary characters id love to see jaume collet serra direct more blockbusters like this one one thing to improve would be to define the main antagonist the devil earlier in the film because for most of the duration of the movie it is unclear what the main threat or problem is
Oct 25 2022,positive,a fresh approach to dceu love to see more of dr fate
Oct 25 2022,negative,the problem with this movie is the acting just plain horrible no character arc very thin story line the fx are cool

Oct 25 2022,positive,honestly enjoyed the movie felt like a right step in a better direction for dc i remember when green lantern came out and the utter disappointment i felt then the snyder movies which rushed ahead with batman vs superman destroying the story i once loved then the justice league fiasco 3 hour badly edited movie then a 4 hour badly edited movie this finally honestly feels like dc remembered how to make a comicbook movie nice and simple origin story with good casting glad to see caville again he was one of the few of the justice league cast i liked just a bit confused why he was stuffed in at the end unless some movie picks up from where it left off but overall enjoyed it
Oct 25 2022,positive,it is one of the best movies in dc everything is top of notch from jaume colletserras direction to dwayne johnson aldis hodge noah centineo sarah shahi marwan kenzari quintessa swindell bodhi sabongui pierce brosnan acting a fullpacked movie deserve a 5star from me

Oct 25 2022,negative,the writers should be fired this script was something i could have wrote at 12yrs old cgi was ok so many cringe moments in this movie
Oct 25 2022,negative,had the budget for writing been even close to the special effects and casting the product might have been mediocre as released this film is impossibly difficult to see through repeated cliche thin plot lines  stolen parallels to the marvel universe im remiss to watch such talent puppet a story that simply never should have been brought to screen major thumbs down one case in which i wish i had more thumbs
Oct 25 2022,positive,great movie loved the story cant wait to see what they continue to do with this new character and its other established characters in the dc universe

Oct 25 2022,positive,honestly i thought it was an enjoyable movie tbh i liked the dark tone it had in some scenes throughout the movie cast was great action was great now the plot went in a different way than i expected but i still enjoyed the overall plot
Oct 25 2022,positive,where do i start     black adam is an exciting breathtaking and sublime actionpack movie the character building at the start was necessary to carve out black adams back story greek mythology played a huge part in this movie our protagonist finds himself summoned after being asleep for 5000 years he takes a journey which entails a couple of clever writing and funny moments overall i was greatly satisfied and i would recommend black adam to the ethos tell them the man in black sent you
Oct 25 2022,positive,excellent movie one of the best of the genre  ignore the stupid critics the public speaks
Oct 25 2022,positive,it feels soo good to experience a movie like this i love dc so much since i was a child props to the rock and the team this is just the beginning dc fun we can now take pride of our movies great job

Oct 25 2022,positive,fun movie  so much fun very action packed and satisfying
Oct 25 2022,positive,its obviously not like a masterpiece work of cinema that will be admired for centuries but i didnt go in expecting that i went in expecting a fun movie and thats exactly what i got so i think it is totally worth a high rating
Oct 25 2022,positive,its a great refreshment seeing a superhero movie that isnt total kidfriendly the cgi was great and i enjoyed the constant action pack movie that is rare now a days

Oct 25 2022,positive,the rock really working hard for this movie its far more enjoy and excitement
Oct 25 2022,positive,loved a lot about this film the action was top notch hawkman and dr fate were dynamic and the rocks passion for this film was on full display throughout while the villain was lame and the t2 dynamic with the kid was a bit much for my taste i loved the mythology weaved into the film and the display of adams powers i cant wait to see the inevitable sequel and the fight teased by the incredible midcredits scene
Oct 25 2022,positive,the dceu is more alive than ever loved it
Oct 25 2022,positive,nothing new here its the same rehashing of pop tropes  i was bored out of my skull
Oct 25 2022,positive,movie is rocking like a rock i like the doctor fate character its a must watch movie for the dc fans
Oct 25 2022,positive,the movie is pretty good it starts off slow but after 20 minutes it becomes a really great film
Oct 25 2022,positive,the movie offered us what true fans of dc and superhero movies have been looking for for a long time a lot of action we were bored of the exaggerated humor of marvel thor love and thunder is also not a film that seeks the grace of the progressive minority it gave us the return of good actors like pierce brosnan and henry cavill i liked the performance of the hawkman actor and the performance of dwayne johnson is incredible
Oct 25 2022,positive,its a good movie it feels a bit like marvel but its great to bring superman
Oct 25 2022,positive,loved it in your face action
Oct 25 2022,positive,it was a very well made movie dywane johnson an pierce brosnan both did a fantastic job  dywane johnson should be happy with him self for how well the movie came out special for how long he had to fight to get it made congratulations on the movie

Oct 25 2022,positive,it was a great experience one of his best performances

Oct 25 2022,positive,awesome movie i wish there was more of jsa in the dc
Oct 25 2022,positive,the plot line was very thorough no gaps no holes moved along quickly all the characters were relatable the scenes were seamless flowing from past present to future  one of the best actionhero movies ive seen in a very long time one of the best
Oct 25 2022,positive,excellent superhero action film  blunt and violentbut has something to say about geopolitics and colonial exploitation
Oct 25 2022,positive,i really enjoyed it and found it highly entertaining it was better than thor love and thunder and really comparable interest and visually to dr strange into the multiverse of madness in my opinion so im a bit shocked by all the bad reviews online
Oct 25 2022,positive,we love to see more its addicting surely we the public loves it
Oct 25 2022,positive,so tired of pompous brats getting paid to write their whiny complaints this movie is actually good and made for a certain demographic i enjoyed watching it thought the modern day kid bit was cheesy but it is a good movie and set up a lot of things im so tired of not getting to see live action plans play out on the big screen because of critics dont even understand why that job exists
Oct 25 2022,positive,not perfect but it was action packed and fun
Oct 25 2022,positive,overall a really good solid superherocomic book flick loved seeing classic heroes like hawkman and dr fate in action as as well as atom smasher and cyclone i think they could have done more with the later 2 though as they were really cool characters the rock was awesome i did like how well he fit into the role and of course the spoiler at the end was the icing on the cake 
Oct 25 2022,positive,a fantastic movie that made me return to the theathers to enjoy it as it should be totally worth it
Oct 25 2022,positive,great movie great characters thankfull that is not another disney comedy

Oct 25 2022,positive,finally dc got it right  the best dc movie
Oct 25 2022,positive,it was one of the best superhero movies of these years it is way better than all of the other movies of dc except for batman and all of marvel movies i loved it
Oct 25 2022,positive,best cinematography ive seen in a while  there are sine story parts missing but over all great job
Oct 25 2022,positive,fucken oath of a movie everything was fun with comedy sprinkled unlike the mcus tlat other thank that movie was perfection for an audiences standpoint

Oct 25 2022,positive,this movie didnt  disappoint  i enjoyed it
Oct 25 2022,positive,the plot feels like a video game well great i love video games
Oct 25 2022,positive,love it lots of action
Oct 25 2022,positive,there are parts of the story that were predictable and a few repetitive scenes i did think it was fun to see a different set of characters for once and they spared no expense for special effects although every time atom smasher was on screen it felt like i was watching suicide squad or deadpool and was just expecting him to get killed out of nowhere
Oct 25 2022,positive,everything other than the plot was absolutely awesome
Oct 25 2022,positive,this movie was amazing the rock keeping it real
Oct 25 2022,positive,better than expected great signs for the dceu
Oct 25 2022,positive,honestly it was your average typical anti hero origin story kinda too much going on at the same time but overall it was a good time 710 post credit scene is insane
Oct 25 2022,positive,critics missed the point on this one the best part was the premise presented that other superhero movies have missed oppression and totalitarianism  turning a blind eye to oppression in order to keep global stability is not justice this movie shows what oppression can do to a civilization and how many hope that someone will do something about it
Oct 25 2022,positive,magic man carried the whole movie highly recommended
Oct 25 2022,positive,the film has strengths and weaknesses i thought there was a bit of a lack of taking enough time  outside of the title character  to foster the deeper character moments that lead to memorable impactful emotional moments but the effects action sequences coolfactor cinematography costuming and score are all superbly executed and i personally quite liked the humor    also stay for the midcredits scene
Oct 25 2022,positive,the rock was good ngl
Oct 25 2022,positive,a hell of a ride i certainly love it for the fun and unadulterated carnage frankly it is not perfect but then again a comic film is supposed to entertainedand i was royally entertained the rock rockedbig time
Oct 25 2022,positive,the best movies ever made by favorite actor
Oct 25 2022,neutral,they should of explained more about js and the movie was kind of cheesy plus that kid was annoying
Oct 25 2022,positive,a solid movie addition in the dcu a little light on plot and character development but full of action with bits of humor sprinkled throughout
Oct 25 2022,positive,great action and fun entertaining humor
Oct 25 2022,positive,aiming more for style over substance  loud and bombastic over tense and engaging black adam is good enough to be worth the trip but not quite strong enough to move the needle for the dc heroverse
Oct 25 2022,positive,amazing  ill give it an 8510 cgi  needs more improvement
Oct 25 2022,positive,brrrrrrrrr cold money money  hard cashhhhh
Oct 25 2022,negative,dc just is like a weird version of marvel like dwayne was great but corny movie in general copy cat powers and characters

Oct 25 2022,positive,this movie was fantastic it was action packed from beginning to end the rock did great
Oct 25 2022,positive,it should be rotten tomatoes marvel tomatometer   because these marvel fan critics doesnt like dc in the first place   black adam is a very good superhero movie
Oct 25 2022,positive,i love this kind of movies
Oct 25 2022,positive,better than the marvel trash  if you want entertainment and nothing more this is your movie no complex story  nothing more just pure action  look the movie like the cartoons that you saw in your childhood thinking just in enjoy and you will love it and of course you will love the post credit scene
Oct 25 2022,positive,action packed and very good
Oct 25 2022,positive,it was so good everything you want action and funny loved it
Oct 25 2022,positive,do listen to the critics movie was fire
Oct 25 2022,positive,comicbook movie fan service action worth it to see it  all characters killed it
Oct 25 2022,negative,the movie was awful it wasnt true to the source dr fate was weak and a 1 trick pony adam smasher and cyclone where useless to the plot and the movie
Oct 25 2022,positive,action all the way through
Oct 25 2022,positive,is is a good movie but the rock is a better good guy than mean
Oct 25 2022,positive,it was enjoyable to me as a comic fan but i think they should have done better with the cultural piece they miss the mark when it came to appreciating the middle east culture customs and values this was an american movie with a hint of middle eastern influence do better
Oct 25 2022,positive,forget the critics just go and enjoy this movie i had a lot of fun with the fights and characters interactions dc is doing great    love it
Oct 25 2022,positive,rotten tomatoes  stop showing critics score first  entertainment isnt about a bunch of snobs critiquing art or interpreting it for the masses  its about whats enjoyable for the masses  simple  does the audience enjoy watching it
Oct 25 2022,positive,was great and not your average super hero film would say it is up there with super man
Oct 25 2022,positive,really good movie the rock is amazing as usual
Oct 25 2022,positive,absolutely awesome dc ensemble movie  the previews do not do it justice lots of fun lots of action
Oct 25 2022,positive,amazing movie so far my favorite this year have absolutely no idea how it could have gotten such poor reviews
Oct 25 2022,positive,this is a movie where you enjoy with beer and pizza rather than a glass of wine
Oct 25 2022,positive,these critics have no clue what theyre talking about would definitely recommend watching it the ending leaves room for more movies to come
Oct 25 2022,positive,loved full of action none stop
Oct 25 2022,positive,fun time action pack movie non stop in a good way
Oct 25 2022,neutral,all i could think about was how it could have been better had they kept the songs at a minimum had they had better and smarter writing regarding war with some form or idea to resolution had they utilized the dramatic tone perfectly set up by sarah shahis acting this would be a special movie with a character who embodies war and freedom rather than another superhero thats the issue i have with dc they are focused on being a superhero movie than a movie that can stand on its own there were character debuts that did not land personally they wasted time doing run of mill cliches i want a special movie not another superhero movie
Oct 25 2022,positive,great comic book movie i dont know why the critics are giving it low ratings
Oct 25 2022,positive,absolutely awesome best cb movie of the year the rock kills it and the post credit scene is everything we have been asking for
Oct 25 2022,positive,critics are completely wrong it is a great movie and cant wait to see the next movie including superman 
Oct 25 2022,positive,awesome fun action packed entertainment what else would you expect from the rock and best of all henry cavill is back as superman yessssss
Oct 25 2022,positive,is it a perfect movie no  is it a good time absolutely    i love it dwayne johnson as the rock was great  pierce brosnan was as charming as always  cyclones powers interpretation beautiful  great casting with those two    i admit the limited to none backstory for thr jsa characters might hurt the experience of some people  yet if you wanna see some cool superheroe fights it is a blast  as a jsa fan i woulda loved a lomger movie to see the members of the justice society of america fleshed out a bit more heres me hoping they release a longer version in blu ray
Oct 25 2022,positive,i have no idea why there are so many negative reviews but i thoroughly enjoyed the movie i think it fits pretty well in the dc universe
Oct 25 2022,negative,bland boring lacks any substance its clear hollywood is running out of ideas two hours wasted
Oct 25 2022,positive,great movie action packed with plenty of story from beginning to end and then soon to come apparently dwayne johnson fits the role on point lets see more
Oct 25 2022,positive,enjoyed it visually stunning and well acted but a little fast through the plotpoints with a couple of comic book inaccuracies solid b
Oct 25 2022,positive,i didnt think this would be great but i enjoyed it more than most of the other dc projects i didnt care for some small things but overall i think its a mustsee for actioncomic fans
Oct 25 2022,positive,its was ok could have been better 
Oct 25 2022,positive,loved this movie and so did my 2  boys critics suck
Oct 25 2022,positive,about time dc didnt get weird cheesy they did a great job wit glad dwane the rock johnson wanted his own movie he deserves it shazam the red kid should be embarrassed to call himself shazam red shazam is a joke
Oct 25 2022,positive,great cast action packed drama a little humor too
Oct 25 2022,positive,i loved the continuous action and the interaction between the characters was very entertaining  i dont know why anyone would listen to a person who makes a living as a critic  the people have spoken
Oct 25 2022,negative,that needed serious script help and way too much bullet time
Oct 25 2022,positive,look  at the end of the day all i wanna do is sit down and watch a good movie and thats all i did  it made  me smile  and i enjoyed myself and really thats what movies are supposed to do thank you rock
Oct 25 2022,neutral,the script and story didnt grip me enough to really care about any of the characters
Oct 25 2022,positive,dont listen to the criticsthis is a true super hero movie made for the fans if you ever watched justice league and justice league unlimited you gonna love this one finally dc is going back on track

Oct 25 2022,positive,awesome movie loved it
Oct 25 2022,positive,didnt have much knowledge on the character so i went in with openeyes was over drawn in by the action but the plot was good the cgi looked amazing but the acting and script was terrible overall 810
Oct 25 2022,positive,great origin story enjoyed the rock right  guy  for the part
Oct 25 2022,positive,a rather long movie but very entertaining and not boring in the least definitely action pack and quite humorous at times if you didnt see it you may be missing out on one of the better movies of the year
Oct 25 2022,positive,a simple and wellclosed script which we offer epic action scenes
Oct 25 2022,positive,this has been the third best movie i have watched and will probably watch many more times   the rock gets us fans and restored the awe and heart of the dc universe as well as comic book movies   i hope that let him continue on this streak maybe collaborating with genius like nolan and snyder to make the dceu even better  so long marvel you blew it by giving us fans the middle finger dc is our new home
Oct 25 2022,positive,i thought the movie was entertaining but nothing spectacular for as long as this movie was in development i just want more a deeper story less forgettable cast and cg up to todays standards this movie although entertaining feels like a movie of ten years ago and falls a bit flat if you are looking to go see a movie as entertainment this movie will suit your needs
Oct 25 2022,negative,the writing was very poor the acting very poor character development severely lacking disappointed in pierce brosnan and dwayne johnson for having agreed to do this film
Oct 25 2022,neutral,disappointed by this movie overall it felt incredibly generic and forgettable which was surprising considering how many years it was in development had a few good scenes of the rock taking people down but then the movie sort of just continued doing that without much structure or plot for another 90 minutes final act was cgifest with a very forgettable villain the type of movie youll moderately enjoy once and then completely forget about as soon as its done
Oct 25 2022,positive,great movie whole cast was great they killed it
Oct 25 2022,positive,loved it  stay for the end credits scene  that is all
Oct 25 2022,positive,dr fate is amazing i hope to see more of him 
Oct 25 2022,positive,best action movie on the year
Oct 25 2022,positive,tons of fun it was incredibly fast paced but well directed i did not lose the thread of the plot in all the action of which there is a lot fun movie

Oct 25 2022,positive,awesome movie amazing action the rock gave it his all
Oct 25 2022,positive,with no raised eyebrow no peoples elbow or rock bottom the rock growing character work entertains with charisma and charm from a well rounded cast this movie wins via roll up into a small package
Oct 25 2022,positive,a good superhero movie worth the money for a good time
Oct 25 2022,positive,the best dwaynes movie
Oct 25 2022,positive,graphics were amazing it kept my attention  definitely a thrill seeker
Oct 25 2022,positive,lots of actionthe villain at the end needed better cg but all the action and the rock made the movie
Oct 25 2022,positive,action packed with a little humor
Oct 25 2022,positive,awesome film the future is bright
Oct 25 2022,positive,this movie was an incredibly enjoyable film dc is definitely back and delivering in the many ways marvel has failed to marvel has been wrapped up in woke culture adhering to social norms in fear of being cancelled dc is delivering to the fans what we really want from these heroes and franchise rather than societys expectations definitely recommend
Oct 25 2022,positive,a really good movie 10010
Oct 25 2022,positive,this is a weird one for me its like a ryan reynolds movie acting the same way in each film this is the rock being the rock does it make it a bad movie heck no could some parts be better yes it couldve  there were some parts which made me go wtf it doesnt make sense and then there were parts that made me go thats fucking awesome but overall it did what its suppose to do entertain and get you exited for future installments
Oct 25 2022,positive,this movie was pretty good definitely made my inner child happy
Oct 25 2022,positive,fun and always interesting
Oct 25 2022,positive,i gotta be honest this movie was great from beginning to end i had a very good time a very good time critics dont like that it wasnt super story based but here the story serves the action instead of the other way around and it was awesome there can be different types of movies and still be good this was good
Oct 25 2022,positive,superb  if they stick to this caliber of movies then dc wont have to worry about the future  the rock plays it just right
Oct 25 2022,positive,the good super hero action is back

Oct 25 2022,positive,nice movie i liked almost everything the characters the plot and mainly the fights the only things that i didnt liked very much was some not funny jokes but there was good ones the harmless army that was no thread at all and the lack of development of some characters but these are just details nothing that detracts from the movie
Oct 25 2022,positive,loved it the movie left me wanting more from the other charactersheroes the action was great and the acting was good cgi was pretty good except for the final boss at the end
Oct 25 2022,positive,action packed and dj kept his promise to give the fans what they wanted

Oct 24 2022,positive,getting this out of the way immediately this is not going to win any awards for story writing however if you want a good movie that is fun and full of action and know what the rock does and his acting skill you will love it yeah too much cgi but to pull off the comic book feel it happens will be buying it because it is fun and did not feel like i wasted my money

Oct 24 2022,positive,absolutely loved the movie cant wait to see where dc goes from here
Oct 24 2022,positive,all in all a fantastic movie    does it have its flaws obviously it does but they do not detract from the final product    the rock is here to save dc by giving the fans what they want shocking i know but it works the action scenes were phenomenal and reminded me of a mix between 300mangacomics they pack a punch as well as demonstrate how powerful these super beings are    the plot while simple its carried by the good comedy and the excelent performances of the actors shout out to aldis hodge and pierce brosnan who work perfectly with one another the rock is on the role of his life here he was born to play this character    dont believe the critics watch this movie you will not regret it
Oct 24 2022,positive,such a great superhero movie probably the dcu best one yet
Oct 24 2022,neutral,average super hero movie didnt regret seeing it dont care to ever see it again

Oct 24 2022,positive,good movie  righteous always take over evil
Oct 24 2022,negative,i love the rock  but its a shame that he waited 15 years to make this film  too many special effects with no point didnt connect or love any of the characters no story or character development   sorry  maybe needs another director  i hope the sequels are much better  i think they can be
Oct 24 2022,positive,this movie is so fun that i want to watch it again
Oct 24 2022,positive,this movie was litt  my only issue is how noticeable it was that scenes were shaved down for a pg13 rating i really hope that well be getting a uncut version to fill in the blanks aside from that a very action packed film where dr fate  hawkman stand out and gave awesome performances     my rating would be a 7510
Oct 24 2022,positive,one of the best dceu theatrical experiences to date action packed and full of interesting refreshing characters that work well together in a setting thats completely new for the dceu legitimately fun to watch without being shallow i could have done without all of the slomo scenes but thats really my only criticism i cant wait to see more from these heroes
Oct 24 2022,positive,good action the movie flows story and plot are ok
Oct 24 2022,positive,enjoyed it surprised me somewhat oh and lots of action
Oct 24 2022,positive,the rock rules fantabuloso

Oct 24 2022,positive,it was enjoyable but not fantastic and very accurate to the comics in so many capacities

Oct 24 2022,positive,pretty good for a dc movie still dark but they had some light hearted comedy it felt a little drawn out but otherwise it was a pretty great movie cant wait for more
Oct 24 2022,positive,tal vez no sea una obra profúnda pero es una película llena de acción con emocionantes momentos que complacen a los fans de dc y el esperado regreso de henry cavill como superman    una película emblemática por el simple hecho de revivir el dceu gracias a the rock    it may not be a deep work but it is an actionpacked movie with exciting moments that please dc fans and the longawaited return of henry cavill as superman    an emblematic film for the simple fact of reviving the dceu thanks to the rock
Oct 24 2022,positive,honestly i went into this with next to no expectations im a lover of what snyder brought to the dceu with mos bvsue and zsjl however i was worried that the old management at wb was going to ruin this instalment i was wrong dwayne johnson has really fought for the dceu and he has truly listened to the fans the story is very simple and nothing to write home about but the cast is exceptional especially dr fate and hawkman real scene stealers and the action is top tier its nice to watch a superhero movie that doesnt take itself too seriously and embraces the over the top nature of what superhero movies should be able the cgi is exquisite the cast is beautiful and its honestly such a brilliant movie finally that end credit scene chefs kiss as a dc fan were finally getting somewhere we want to be go see it and judge for yourself
Oct 24 2022,positive,i will watch this movie over and over again i pray i am one of the characters in the movie some day the rockrocks

Oct 24 2022,positive,i went in expecting something simple but i was in for a surprise it delivers everything you expect from a movie based on a comic book when you read a comic book you want action fights good scenery and this movie has all of that no stupid jokes or infantilization of the characters without trying too hard this delivers an entertaining and well structured movie
Oct 24 2022,positive,love it is been a very long time since dc release a good movie i was stuck at the screen from start to end
Oct 24 2022,positive,graphics  special effects 10 background story was a little confusing for me  but i would watch it again love the costumes

Oct 24 2022,positive,way better than i expected top notch action and a good story 
Oct 24 2022,positive,ah so refreshing dc is back on the map baby the acting across the board is just okay no one stood out its a comic movie its the exception to have outstanding acting not the norm  even when typically great actors are involved the writing was good not great there were many stale oneliners i loved that we visited a nonus locationculture and that the movie had that area claim their hero based on their values it jumps right in no origin story for much of the cast and it works idk these other heroes and idgaf its not their movie lots of boomboombangbang to keep us engaged  a throughandthrough action movie for superhero movie fans it shouldnt win any awards because its fun loud and the rock but damn was it entertaining
Oct 24 2022,positive,awesome action packed loved it
Oct 24 2022,positive,solid dc movie im happy it turned out well
Oct 24 2022,positive,just a fun movie to watch and have a good time watching dwayne johnson is awesome in the lead role and has some great interactions with the other heroes in the movie i believe this is a good movie to help jumpstart the dceu and has me very exciting for upcoming dc films
Oct 24 2022,positive,the movie was a lot of fun to watch there was some unevenness with the story but the action was great  i thought as an origin story it was decent  i thought the js was  a little underwhelming though hawkman and fate really shined
Oct 24 2022,positive,this movie was amazing and a mustsee
Oct 24 2022,positive,fun badass hero movie the best of style since dead pool
Oct 24 2022,positive,it was an amazing movie that brought to life a new group of superheroes very very cool superman at the end was simply epic
Oct 24 2022,positive,what more could you want from a superhero movie   the action the visuals the credit scene i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend
Oct 24 2022,positive,i consider this one of the best superhero movies made and i consider superhero movies to be kinda the point of movies which isnt to say that they are deserving of special attention but at least they are fun sometimes like this one
Oct 24 2022,positive,pros  great action scenes  nice choice of characters  decent soundtrack  good cgi most of the time  nice but simple story  good acting    cons  acting could have been better at certain scenes that should have been more emotional  some characters should have got just a little bit more dialogue and screen time  main kid character was unnecessary
Oct 24 2022,negative,confusing at best  boring at worst  im a massive fan of johnson but it seems some marketing person thought they could make a movie about him floating ominously in a cape  the story made no sense sadly  went in with high hopes came out wondering why they squandered such a great opportunity my 11 year old son shared my dismay 
Oct 24 2022,positive,actionpacked and entertaining forget the haters
Oct 24 2022,negative,comic book  which i expected but too much senseless action with no character development ok for kids but not like previous dc movies
Oct 24 2022,positive,well done basics very beautiful cgi and an amazing debut for dr fate and the rock charismatic as ever
Oct 24 2022,positive,i love dwayne johnson and most of his films and tv shows this was an entertaining movie lots of action and bad humor only dwayne johnson can deliver
Oct 24 2022,positive,its another one of those films without much substance but youll have a good time
Oct 24 2022,positive, great pace  action top 3 dceu movie
Oct 24 2022,positive,its a good movie about an antihero dont let bad opinions from pseudo experts ruin your viewing experience
Oct 24 2022,positive,the rock fits the role perfectly very good movie and action packed
Oct 24 2022,positive,i loved it so awesome
Oct 24 2022,negative,filled with mindless action and an extremely rushed plot slomo action was especially overused and the villain had zero personality while i appreciate that this movie doesnt have excessive humor i really think the plot was lacking in terms of the jsa backstory and the poorly written dialogue for the young boy which really took me out of the movie amazing visuals though certainly better than recent marvel projects
Oct 24 2022,positive,some of the dialogue was a little cheesy but lots of action i didnt get bored watching it
Oct 24 2022,positive,enjoyable was glued to the screen entertaining movie so dont know what the critics what against it way better than thor so why are critics giving that a rating in the 60s and this in the 40s guess disney pays more
Oct 24 2022,negative,poor character development lousy soundtrack plot went nowhere  id like my 2 hours back please
Oct 24 2022,positive,great movie worth the wait
Oct 24 2022,positive,amazing gosto the teather with your family do that and you will be happy
Oct 24 2022,positive,everything he promises he delivers no pretend to be a masterpiece but it is very entertaining and fun too watch
Oct 24 2022,positive,amazing movie fun full of action great story the beginning was a bit slow but that ended quick the theater was cheering laughing and clapping by the end
Oct 24 2022,positive,slightly confusing at times however it turned out to be a great comic book movie
Oct 24 2022,positive,this was surprisingly good yes there are some parts that should have been left out skateboarding kidwhy but overall lots of action and a fun watch
Oct 24 2022,positive,great movie great effects dwayne gave me an entertaining movie and something that i hadnt had for a long timefaith
Oct 24 2022,positive,action in this movie was on par with man of steel better than most if not all dc films worth the money for sure
Oct 24 2022,positive,movie was down right if you are looking for an action hero movie just watch it it is probably the best hero movie i have seen in the last 5 years
Oct 24 2022,positive,its not the best movie of the year but it is entertaining
Oct 24 2022,positive,great movie with lots and lots of action almost non stop
Oct 24 2022,positive,the movie was great  it reminded me of see the mommy movies or an indiana jones movie it was that good
Oct 24 2022,positive,it isnt an art piece but is nice it has an good soundtrack nice fight scenes and good characters like smasher or amon
Oct 24 2022,positive,lets start with the bad the story is mostly nonsensical with some good parts hollywood needs to find better writers or pay them better because the level of story telling in movies is getting worse and worse the characters make stupid decisions and we are suppose to care about the death of a character we barely know    the good the rock makes things go boom
Oct 24 2022,positive,ignore the critics who probably never watched it this is a dark super hero movie that continues the dceu superman is also back this is the best movie seen with dj in it want to see more hawkman the fact that were talking about this movie tells you a lot about it keep this going dc embrace the darkness you do so well
Oct 24 2022,positive,im not super familiar with any of the characters in this movie there are a few lines that felt a little too the rock and the kid character in training atom smasher provided the comedy that was also a bit annoying at times dr fate was great to see on the big screen i found it pretty entertaining overall would recommend
Oct 24 2022,positive,very straight forward movie well produced not to long not to short well done
Oct 24 2022,positive,one of the best dc movies
Oct 24 2022,positive,good action couple of laughs here and there overall good movie
Oct 24 2022,positive,one of the better dc movie only some characters could have had a little more backstory for who dont know all the dc characters in this movie its a great action popcorn movie and im very excited for what can come next after seeing the endcredit scene
Oct 24 2022,positive,its an amazing movie you must see it by yourself
Oct 24 2022,positive,it was a fresh style for dc without giving up all things dc i would see it again and great job
Oct 24 2022,positive,good action not a lot blood and guts
Oct 24 2022,positive,no way near a polished film but thoroughly enjoyed it dwayne johnsons charisma and a wellrounded jsa cast did wonders for the film also have to mention that piers brosnan as dr fate was fantastic
Oct 24 2022,positive,action popcorn flick with some good twists and some character development towards the end
Oct 24 2022,positive,love the action of the movie rock performed awesome  the guy who played did also
Oct 24 2022,positive,not as bad as critics make it sound and not as great as audiences make it sound its decent 
Oct 24 2022,positive,i dont know whats going on with the critics but this move is fresh i was nervous going in to this as i usually lose interest in a film once i find out the rock is staring in it johnson surprised me in the role by not playing the same character he always plays it is a great time at the theater
Oct 24 2022,positive,one of the best super heroes movies in a while the action scenes were great the costumes looked great specially hawkmans dont listen to the hating critics  this movie was worth the watch i mean come on they gave love  thunder a higher score and that movie was booty cheeks
Oct 24 2022,positive,best super heroe movie of the year missed a good super heroe movie full of action and good cgi
Oct 24 2022,positive,brilliant film shows that there is hope for dc future
Oct 24 2022,positive,i originally was not super interested in seeing this movie because im not happy with how warner brothers has handled the dceu is anyone listening i literally saw this movie because of the superman mid credits scene i ended up really enjoying the film overall
Oct 24 2022,positive,its simple has nice photography and at the end of the day is a comic movie so its nice to enjoy with your popcorn 
Oct 24 2022,neutral,in this movie young mark ruffalo plays the antman in a deadpool costume along with the golden falcon and a couple of other people whose powers i didnt understand it also had the rock also at the end a bunch of guys with crowbars ran to attack the devil 25 stars
Oct 24 2022,positive,this movie was amazing absolutely  loved it a few plot holes but over all worth going to see
Oct 24 2022,negative,an uneven film which has all the elements of a superhero movie but doesnt put them to best use  the plot was ok with one surprising element in it and the fight scenes were good with lots of focus on destruction and spectacle but they did get a bit boring due to all of the characters being invulnerable  the new team of blist superheroes introductions and backstories were rushed the evil hightech mercenaries wouldnt shoot a child for plot reasons and disappeared completely in the second half and there was an undead army who were defeated by untrained civilians wielding pipes all probably due to the lower age rating rather than embracing the darkness the character and setting deserved  the quality of special effects  cgi noticeably dropped in the final act and although there was a fair amount of humour mixed in to keep things it didnt really fit within the story of an oppressed civilization rising up
Oct 24 2022,neutral,seriously how can anyone give this move a 4 or 5 out 5 stars this dialogue story comedy and character development are so cringy 
Oct 24 2022,positive,it was very well done  loved it and each character
Oct 24 2022,positive,my daughters enjoyed it
Oct 24 2022,positive,it was worth the several years wait to see the rock in this roll just the popcorn flick the doctor ordered
Oct 24 2022,positive,it was a fantastic action movie it did go overboard with the talking at times with unnecessary dialogue but thats typical of dc films all and all dwayne johnson killed it i was laughing uncontrollably at times i can honestly say i was blown away
Oct 24 2022,positive,amazing movie dc is been better and better   this movie is one of the best dc movie of course it can be a bit better but its really good
Oct 24 2022,positive,it was a little too unrealistic that the mom son and uncle made it through without a scratch  but the movie was very entertaining  very action packed  i love dwayne johnson
Oct 24 2022,positive,pretty good and great action and special effects
Oct 24 2022,positive,great fun movie lots of action and some funny comedy lines all the characters were a great combination and worked well with each other the actors who played them are a perfect fit  cant wait for the next one
Oct 24 2022,positive,very well made  i almost believe the rumors that some critics are paid off to give bad reviews
Oct 24 2022,positive,good anithero movie
Oct 24 2022,positive,this movie was really great and had some really fun twists it was great to see the rock playing a character where it doesnt feel like hes just playing himself and atom smasher is a character from the comics so for all the idiots saying hes a ripoff of ant man hes really not and hes been in the jsa for a long time overall a great movie and shows just how awesome the dcu can be
Oct 24 2022,positive,the best hero movie of 2022
Oct 24 2022,positive,love it dc movies are always good
Oct 24 2022,positive,the movie was very well made the plot has good and most of the cgi were so well made     what the heck happened with the cgi of the demon and its minions and why would the evil minions be so weak badly made and without a purpose     i think the main characters carried the movie with the rock being an absolute beast
Oct 24 2022,negative,how did anyone allow this to get released it felt like a ripoff super hero movie from 20 years ago with 90s cgi
Oct 24 2022,positive,dr fate was amazing
Oct 24 2022,positive,the film was just right the action storyline characters and sfx was decent wouldve liked doctor fate to be alive though except for the slightly lame villain towards the end was great overall would have helped if shazam and superman had a role with superman having one beyond the cameo
Oct 24 2022,positive,i would say by far the best dc eu movie that we have gotten in a long time and finally dwayne johnson made it happen he brought henry cavill superman back home dc has been sailing for so many years and finally dwayne johnson made it happen this movie was epic to me seeing all these justice society heroes introducing new characters thats cool and possibly more in the future what was my favorite the most was they kept the movie kind of close to dark dc like the batman versus superman but not too dark
Oct 24 2022,positive,exceptional and wildly entertaining  the critics got their consensus wrong big time
Oct 24 2022,positive,really good movie really like the action
Oct 24 2022,positive,the best dc movie in the past several years could always be better but a massive step in the right direction
Oct 24 2022,positive,this was an amazing movie honestly probably the best anti hero movie around the action in it is literally amazing i had no point in the movie felt underwhelmed and my fiance actually stayed awake for this one 1010 would love to watch again
Oct 24 2022,positive,best movie in this year
Oct 24 2022,positive,amazing its a movie made for fans
Oct 24 2022,positive,action packed superhero movie visually stunning
Oct 24 2022,positive,fast action  enjoyed the rock character too
Oct 24 2022,positive,its hard to see dj as a more serious character but they did a good job with the movie for the most part i really like the character design in this movie for all of them scenes with people i didnt enjoy much but overall the story is pretty straight forward like reading a comic book  i feel that adding the extra characters made this movie more attractive and i have to say that dr fate was my favorite hero in the movie i would watch it again
Oct 24 2022,positive,its a amazon movie i love the action of this movie there is some funny moment which is great some people said that this movie is dumb but i think they are too dumb to understand i am also excited for upcoming movie
Oct 24 2022,positive,best superhero movie this year so far the rock dis and absolute great job and everyone on the cast as well we got superman back
Oct 24 2022,positive,best super hero movie since infinity war ignore thre critics its great
Oct 24 2022,positive,action packed from beginning to end a true fan pleaser is dwayne johnson
Oct 24 2022,positive,overall just a great and fun movie i do think that brosnan as dr fate really stole the show but johnson was truly made for black adam cant wait to go see it again
Oct 24 2022,positive,thanks dc for this  movie the rock killed it and justice society was awesome 
Oct 24 2022,positive,started as a solid 810 some issues with the writing and some cheezy scenes near the end dropped it to 610 and then it went back to 810 every moment black adam was on screen killing people and then the after credits scene made this 1 2010 for me f yeah
Oct 24 2022,positive,best movie ever watchde it in theatres had a huge boner my friend also loved it dwayne johnson the goat anyone who makes fun of him is going against me a 66 6 pack huge biceps man so come along make fun of him and your ded
Oct 24 2022,positive,its a fun movie and the kids enjoyed it  digs deep into some dclore which is probably why critics dont understand it thus dont like it maybe not woke enough  my only gripe is that black adam should have pointyears  hawk man does a great job as well
Oct 24 2022,positive,it was a good movie goodnaction some laughs
Oct 24 2022,positive,was a really nice step away from the traditional format that the mcu produces i enjoyed the rocks take as black adam and how his actions spoke much louder than his words however few there were i loved the magical dimensional character and casting that man was a good choice for that role id love to follow along with this character in a sequel or series
Oct 24 2022,positive,action packed and a nice refreshing take from the typical super hero stuff the rock fits this role perfectly ill admit that there are some cringe aspects to this film but those can be easily overlooked
Oct 24 2022,positive,a fun non stop action packed movie
Oct 24 2022,positive,black adam is why you go see a comic book movie heroes and villains true to their known originsfor the most part cool story that lets you leave the day behind and the rock bringing it
Oct 24 2022,positive,great movie     excellent plot as well as acting by everyone especially johnson  cant wait for the sequel and the dvd release
Oct 24 2022,positive,proof that nobody cares what critics have to say
Oct 24 2022,positive,really enjoyed the action comedy and story was actually better than i anticipated cant wait to see all heroes together in one film hope dr fate continues on
Oct 24 2022,positive,definitely a high point for dc i thought this movies action was great the actingcasting for this movies main characters were made very well wouldnt call it better than man of steel but its a close second
Oct 24 2022,positive,good stuff adding henry was a good choice as well
Oct 24 2022,positive,pretty good movie one of the better dc has to offer

Oct 24 2022,positive,this movie was amazing it was nice to watch a movie with no political agenda no nudity just an action movie from start to finish i like humor it had in it i liked how the movie did not try to stay so serious and dark it was a good movie must watch
Oct 24 2022,negative,im not sure how i can even feel right about giving it half a star so many parallels between the mcu and this movie  there was not many original things about it the cgi was terribly done and the inconsistency in dwaynes performance had me rolling my eyes screaming for the next scene amped up and hyped up for nothing im not sure if dc is to blame the director or the rock

Oct 24 2022,positive,this introduction to black adam was really badass and a great character to add to the dc universe it had a ton of action along with comedy throughout the movie it was definitely better than i expected it to be the story behind black adam made you sympathize with his character the ending really set up dc for future movies stay for the end credits
Oct 24 2022,negative,black adam is a triumph of sorts its a loud dumb tribute to the emotionally stunted audience who clamors for this kind of soulless tripe congratulations to the primates who spend their entire existence playing video games and watching tiktoks of guys getting hit in the balls over and over because thats the target audience for this movie and that mark was hit squarely on the head kudos to all the basic bros who whined griped and moaned loud enough that wbdc made a movie just for you

Oct 24 2022,negative,i was waiting for the rock to ask if anybody smelled what he was cooking
Oct 24 2022,positive,this film gives us what we want something different from marvel this movies follows the same brutal narrative that has made dc animation legendary us the fans the critics wont be silenced this is a straight up action movie 
Oct 24 2022,positive,awesome straight to the point movie  loved that the main bad guy was there in ain sight from jump  great action sequences  loved how they linked the lady and her some to teth adams past  my fav part honestly was when the jsa was booed by the civilians i hope they touch more on that in future films  the critics low rates the movie and it goes to show u how out of touch the critics are
Oct 24 2022,negative,its an okay movie lots of thrilling and epic actions i love most pierce brosnan acting in the movie yet its unfortunate his character is put to death in the movie
Oct 24 2022,positive,forget the critics black atom is exactly what its supposed to be if youve read any comics of black atom hes a territorial brutal herovillain thats exactly what the rock gives you and the rest of the cast rules
Oct 24 2022,positive,so much fun and action ready for whats next in the dceu
Oct 24 2022,positive,this movie providing everything i was looking for in a superhero movie the movie couldve been a little shorter but thats the only complaint it had lots of cool shots and was visually  appealing unlike other shows and movies marvel was producing this was one of the better superhero films released this year
Oct 24 2022,positive,i love the lore and have been a fan of this character and shazam  captain marvel for 40 years action popcorn movie with no agenda or political message i plan on seeing this multiple times and will drag along family and friends really want a no holds barred cage match superman v black adam v shazam movie lets get ready to rumble thanks for the movie rock much love for you brother
Oct 24 2022,negative,not a fan of the rock he seems to play the same character in every movie hes in
Oct 24 2022,positive,the critics never watch the shazam this is the best yet and couldnt be better
Oct 24 2022,positive,absolute must see love the characters it was packed with action and funny 
Oct 24 2022,positive,loved the introduction of the jsa  big fan of dr fate  great backstory on teth adam and the link to the future of the dcu
Oct 24 2022,positive,solid flick dr fate was the best
Oct 24 2022,positive,i dont understand how this got a lower score than 2013 redemption its the best movie ive seen this year better than thor imo this movie is fantastic visually  the story line is good but they couldve used alot more explaining of the justice society members
Oct 24 2022,positive,loud and entertaining  a bit of a longer than normal build up to get to the action  it would have been nice to see him get out of the area but it is his first appearance in movies so i can appreciate they had to take some time and establish some character related background   lets hope with the next one they can really go big with the story and environment
Oct 24 2022,neutral,the writing the atom smasher was a total copycat of antman in the comedic sense
Oct 24 2022,positive,great action and popcorn movie lot of visuals cgi action and gotta love the post credit scene i wish they would have developed the plot line a little better but it is what it is if you want a movie thats fun to watch not all the crazy politics and just relax and eat popcorn this is probably one of the better comic books movies to come out in the past year or 2
Oct 24 2022,positive,great movie  want more
Oct 24 2022,negative,i cant imagine anyone would find this entertaining unless you are a diehard fan of the characters its an extremely poorly made film
Oct 24 2022,positive,big dumb action movie in the best way possible
Oct 24 2022,positive,really enjoyed the movie
Oct 24 2022,positive,a fun movie that is just what you are looking for if you want a lot of action and dont care about a deeper story go in with proper expectations for this type of film and you will have a great time
Oct 24 2022,positive,it was what we expected a 2hr cgi comic book full of action corny jokes and some of our favorite characters come to life on screen  the rotten tomatoes critics need to take the stick out and stop comparing every move of every genre to gone with the wind especially when it comes to dc movies  if this had been a marvel movie they would have been drooling all over it and praising how wonderful it was
Oct 24 2022,positive,great experience the rock delivers hopefully is a brand new start for the dc universe
Oct 24 2022,positive,why dont yall try making a movie instead of criticizing this man 
Oct 24 2022,positive,fantastic and entertaining
Oct 24 2022,positive,it was entertaining and delightfully funny at times didnt mind the lack of a developed villain since this is his origin story pierce brosnan was awesome as dr fate and brings a gravitas to the role that no other actor could stay for the credit scene love this direction for the dceu no more toxic leadership
Oct 24 2022,positive,its a good start in the right direction for dcu
Oct 24 2022,positive,watched it at an imax theatre it had plenty of fight scenes and explosionswhoah supporting cast was great and dj didnt hog the screen time which allowed for some character development
Oct 24 2022,positive,the best i love this movie
Oct 24 2022,positive,a fun popcorn movie black adam is a different kind of hero the kind that his people needs hes a strong man but kind too the justice society is a good superhero team with nice chemistry and good members the film is a must see and the rock rocks he is a tought hero but a hero nonetheless and buckleup for the postcredit scene
Oct 24 2022,negative,horrible story line nothing tied into dc except ant mans nephew
Oct 24 2022,positive,great origin story character intros provides the action this hero deserves possibly best comic movie of the year
Oct 24 2022,positive,good movie finally de dcu made the things correctly with one character we hope good stuff for the next movie of black adam of course with superman there
Oct 24 2022,positive,amazing and entertaining  critics are idiots dr fate easily one of the best things of this movie and the return of one critical character coronated the whole piece
Oct 24 2022,neutral,it wasnt bad but it wasnt good these dc films dont have anything interesting to say there is no message in this movie what is the moral of this story there is so many superhero films and this one doesnt do anything unique to stand out i wanted it to be better but its not  the action was entertaining the rock was the rock there are some funny moments
Oct 24 2022,positive,totally enjoyed it from start to finish  critics are wrong
Oct 24 2022,positive,do not listen to the critics this was a very fun movie the credit scene really was a treat i recommend this movie
Oct 24 2022,negative,shazam and the suicide squad remain the only good dceu movies    while i wasnt horribly bored 100 of the time mostly because the justice society is kinda likeable the story is really uninteresting black adam is a mostly boring character and most of the supporting cast is pointless every time there was an action scene my eyes glazed over and i wanted to go to sleep i honestly dont know why this movie has a 90 audience approval rating on rotten tomatoes and why audiences are saying that the movie has amazing action the action was one of the worst aspects of the film im starting to hate these stupid fanboy audiences
Oct 24 2022,positive,i dont know what any of the official reviews are on about this movie was amazing and i went into it with middling expectations it blew me away its humor was there without undercutting any poignant moments or forcing a laugh in annoying ways it did the job of laying down good origin story without being just an origin story and overall it was just great i wish more cbms were like this one
Oct 24 2022,positive,i liked it it looks like more as a dc or marvel oldfashion movie with superheros in action must be the rock is particularly good in this movie
Oct 24 2022,positive,filme incrivel melhor do ano the rock arrebenta
Oct 24 2022,positive,definitely recommend imax or 4dx
Oct 24 2022,positive,the movie itself was great aside from a fre plot holes where the movie felt a little rushed it was a little dry starting out but once it gets going its a lot of fun definitely a great addition to the dceu catalogue with a great potential for future cameos and hopefully a sequel
Oct 24 2022,positive,excellent film pure action with a simple yet decent story  i loved it and cant wait to see if again
Oct 24 2022,positive,fun movie  great special effects
Oct 24 2022,positive,id say it was a good time at the movies despite an annoying kid a terrible end bad guy and some bad choices for dialogue the third act really drops the ball for everything that happened prior i thought hawkman was the best part he looked great and was a decent team leader for the justice society
Oct 24 2022,positive,the critics have no idea what theyre talking about this movie was awesome
Oct 24 2022,positive,this movie is sure to give you a fun time while watching it it delivers on all the aspects be it action fight emotions inner struggle heroism story character development and pierce steals the show as dr fate overall a highly enjoyable time
Oct 24 2022,positive,i dont know if there is a conspiracy happening but the critics were dead wrong who paid them to sabotage this this movie was the best dc movie i have seen since aqua man im glad i ignored it was fresh great story great action nothing lagged just every scene was on point nonstop action and for once a well put together story line
Oct 24 2022,positive,great movie love the characters wanna see more
Oct 24 2022,positive,good flick not greatbut definitely good i enjoyed it the action effects and obviously dj were very entertaining
Oct 24 2022,positive,story nice the beginning dc universe
Oct 24 2022,negative,this movie was awful slow in parts directing was bad and the cinematography was horrible not to mention bad writing they should have spent more time on the movie vs just trying to add the rock he saved the movie somewhat to give 1 star
Oct 24 2022,positive,i made an ai see 100 superhero movies and it made one
Oct 24 2022,positive,of course this movie doesnt want to be exalted by a high quality script but it was an awesome movie to enjoy that have charisma and theatrical passion with a ton of action and a excellent build up presentation of the new dc characters     the cast was also perfect and their performances
Oct 24 2022,positive,see the acting of dwayne is wholesome and the character of drfate u guys gonna love it and the character of hackman and atom smasher is too sweet action sequesnces are like outstanding  so i prefer u to go dont miss it 
Oct 24 2022,positive,when you to cinema to watch this superhero action movie you expect to find it entertaining which this movie completely is if you are trying to find a super deep and emotive you are watching the wrong movie
Oct 24 2022,positive,100 percent action and fun to watch
Oct 24 2022,positive,good movie great action annoying kid
Oct 24 2022,positive,meh its just all over the place and clunky with many areas where the movie just drags  hawkman is just annoying as fuck
Oct 24 2022,positive,the best anthero movie ever
Oct 24 2022,positive,worth a look on a rainy day if nothing else is going on should be seen in a theater or a wellequipped surround sound set up solid cast not too heavy on the woke stuff    spoiler alert stay for the full credits could be the best part of the movie
Oct 24 2022,positive,definitely a great and exciting movie to watch only problem i had was that the plot felt rushed
Oct 24 2022,positive,this is a good old fashion action flick it succeeds with its action scenes effects and characters where it fails is trying to tell a story weve heard a million times in the most convoluted and predictable way yet i actually think the movie could have been shorter and the story could have been simpler ala john wick the end credit scene is quite possibly the best of any super hero flicks to date yes including marvel
Oct 24 2022,positive,its so fun i loved so much
Oct 24 2022,positive,the best movie of the world
Oct 24 2022,positive,read the  rotten tomatoes and determined it might not be good just another superhero movie but i read the fan reviews and decided it was likely a good movie   thankfully i trust the the people that pay to watch rather than the ones that get paid to watch     movie was extremely entertaining and fun to watch i pay to go and watch movies a lot i love watching a good movies in the theater this movie was seriously action packed with some rediculous graphics and a somewhat stoic role for the guy with the big smile  dwayne johnson but very convincing as a bad good guy i dont need to repeat the storyline like everyone else but i highly recommend you see this movie its a big theater big screen with leather recliners a big bucket of popcorn and a large coke ken mad movie ha ha
Oct 24 2022,positive,i had an amazing time to see this film it has couple flaws but it has great humor awesome action scenes and most cgi were surprisingly impressive everyone did a great job i cant wait for the future of dceu stay for the postcredit scene
Oct 24 2022,positive,i loved the movie dwane was powerful and others actors was very good too dont leave the cinema before credits
Oct 24 2022,positive,black adam is a really fun ride  the rock rocks  the antihero movie is nonstop action  it is true to the golden age comic book mythos right down to hawkmans original nth metal wings while developing an historical story of its own  it also has humor which is reminiscent of the terminator movies  the only complaint that someone unfamiliar with the material might have is who are the good guys and who are the bad guys   from what ive read dwayne johnson was hands on for this entire movie  right down to the super cameo at the end  his efforts resulted in this actionpacked family movie filled with humor pathos superheroes and a great   world class hero
Oct 24 2022,positive,special effects was spot on the story could of been slightly better but over all a good comic book movie
Oct 24 2022,positive,great action movie  one of the best of the year
Oct 24 2022,negative,it was a colossal waste of time
Oct 24 2022,positive,without being great it has many positive aspects and is very good an nteresting character development on the lead figure a good origin story some plot twists good action and a correct dose of humour  moreover it presents new characters that add to the story and have enough time to like them and want to see more in the future  it presents interesting questions about good and evil placing characters in different viewpoints that add to the plot    connections with the dcu also make it interesting to the present and future of the franchise
Oct 24 2022,positive,this is really a game changer for dc the rock aldis hodge and pierce brosnan deliver so awesome characters that makes us want more from them in the near future i would say the dr fate costume is the most beautiful in all hero movies ever all the costumes are a delight in the big screen and the pos credit scene omfg  what a movie gentlemen  what a movie
Oct 24 2022,positive,very enjoyable and fun i dont get why critics hate it so much
Oct 24 2022,positive,do not pay attention to any of these bad reviews this is by far the best dc movie ever made this movie not only exceeds expectations but has a great story line and is very detailed with all the characters the rock is amazing and i could see myself coming to see this movie more than once in theaters
Oct 24 2022,positive,excellent hero movie i really enjoyed the best movie since hero infinity war
Oct 24 2022,positive,the best movie of super heroes in 2022

Oct 24 2022,positive,3350 pure fun and spectacle not dcs best nor worst but in the middle still the most entertaining of dcs films
Oct 24 2022,positive,i loved this from beginning to end dont care at all what the critics say its a great movie with a great story supporting actors  characters are top notch action is great best super movie since endgame in my opinion
Oct 24 2022,positive,such a fun movie i was entertained from start to finish great job to the rock and cast
Oct 24 2022,positive,if you expect action and fun it definitely meets it a classic the rock movie
Oct 24 2022,positive,divertido empolgante e claro the rock sendo the rock  recomendadíssimo
Oct 24 2022,positive,it was great action pack movie awesome cgi and so on but the story needed more improvement and a little more screen time for the characters and it would have been great if the movie did show the lords of order and chaos and dr fate speaking to the lords of order and vice versa
Oct 24 2022,positive,was entertaining  i got to see what the rock was cooking
Oct 24 2022,positive,good movie to see in theaters  the made it simple and very fun to see the story  was the best dc film since aquaman and bring energy to dc universe
Oct 24 2022,positive,not amazing but i enjoyed seeing it and thought it was entertaining with a decent plot characters motivations couldve been a little more fleshed out though
Oct 24 2022,positive,amazing movie so big so fun increrible i strongle recommended finally dc found they way
Oct 24 2022,positive,one of the best dc movies  this is on par with aquaman and if it had come out 5 years ago would have set the dceu up for true success
Oct 24 2022,positive,it was a fun and uncomplicated action movie nothing more and nothing less and im perfectly fine with that
Oct 24 2022,positive,my family and i enjoyed the movie not the best dc storyline but the action and the rock made up for it the post credit scene though 
Oct 24 2022,positive,it has the best action scenes a full on theater experience storyline is simple but thats negligible its a mass experience blackadam
Oct 24 2022,positive,must see movie action packed
Oct 24 2022,positive,much better than the last fool marvel movies and series
Oct 24 2022,positive,one of the best dcu movies in my opinion very entertaining
Oct 24 2022,positive,these unbelievable critics are review bombing this movie im trying to remember what the media calls people who review bomb a diverse movie hmmm ill figure it out
Oct 24 2022,positive,excellent movies  great fun  and for the fans and this one  these critics didnt watch the same movies and one worse than the other
Oct 24 2022,positive,great movie i really like it
Oct 24 2022,positive,the movie is awesome since the beggining to the end
Oct 24 2022,positive,great movie one of the best of dcu
Oct 24 2022,positive,movie was well done still hoping for some cohesiveness in the dceu with mos bvs ww17 zsjl but this was a really good film and a hopefully a good start to getting back on track with wbd
Oct 24 2022,positive,its good this movie is sorta like godzilla vs kong where the story telling isnt anything special and can easily be called bad but the action is amazing and all the characters are really fun on the screen tons of action which should in theory satisfy the watchers
Oct 24 2022,positive,story isnt complicated but its a bit confusing at some point amazing action scenes and soundtracks interesting characters especially the jsa and their chemistry the rock really smashed it cant wait for the future films
Oct 24 2022,neutral,could have done with more of some humour that the rock is good at
Oct 24 2022,positive,a very enjoyable movie not the best but enjoyable devoid of the shitty things that hollywood has been releasing these days
Oct 24 2022,negative,no   good really confused  we take a nap  all the time  i need my money back
Oct 24 2022,positive,one of the best superhero movies ever incredible through  through
Oct 24 2022,negative,amazing fight scenes but there were so many that after the first hour they stopped gagging me plot and story were a hot mess and none of the actors were good enough to save the script beautiful gowns tho if i had to use one word to describe the movie it would be gratuitous
Oct 24 2022,positive,once of the best movie in dceu
Oct 24 2022,positive,this was really good
Oct 24 2022,negative,i thought scenes seemed packed together without really focusing on anyone character throughout the movie very predictable and cheap dialogue
Oct 24 2022,positive,excellent action movie  dont waste your time listening to critics who think shehulk is an excellent series  they dont measure the quality of the products but rather what these products bring out of their progressive bubbles  black adam is just a hero movie with everything we see in comics and we love it    a hug from brazil
Oct 24 2022,positive,the movie had really no problems or major flaws it was entertaining the post credits scene was amazing
Oct 24 2022,positive,i like this movie  although the storyline is quite simple it is full of action      btw dr fate and hakeman are having amazing outfits     it is not a perfect movie but for sure it is a fun popcorn movie
Oct 24 2022,positive,i liked parts of this movie but was alot of filler for only a 2 hour film the best part of this movie imo is pierce brosnan he is far too good an actor for this film trying to avoid spoilers but the cgi for the rocks face was a bit off and the ending was very predictable overall i would say this was a middle of the road popcorn flick not as good as the audience score and certainly not as bad as the critic score
Oct 24 2022,positive,one of the best movies of dc in the last years it is not at the same level in history as in the batman or the kind of feeling like in peacemaker but give a fresh and exciting perspective of one nonfamous character from dc at the end 2022 is good year to be a dc fan the batman peacemaker and sandman waiting for the next movies
Oct 24 2022,positive,there was to much slowmo fighting for my taste but the rock has reinvigorated the dc universe its their job to screw it up thanks for giving the fans a movie they wanted to see totally will rewatch this movie when it comes to streaming close second to snyders cut
Oct 24 2022,positive,amazing with a frantic pace the film gives the impression of having only a few minutes i loved
Oct 24 2022,positive,it was okay but the plot was all over the place and rushed some characters were unnecessary and didnt bring anything to the story loved the rock tho
Oct 24 2022,positive,its really entertaining and i strongly believe you will enjoy this film by not comparing it to any other movie its a strong foundation for the future of dc
Oct 24 2022,positive,entertaining  fun critics hate superhero movies in 2022 and suck all the fun out of flicks like this dont listen to them go enjoy its totally worth it

Oct 24 2022,positive,excellent addition to the dc universe
Oct 24 2022,positive,one of the best movies that dc has produced amazing
Oct 24 2022,positive,there were lots of cool well paced action scenes and outside of the bit of clunkiness created by keeping the kid and the electrician uncle in the last third of the movie there isnt much to criticize if youre there for the right reason escapist entertainment ill absolutely be interested is seeing a sequel if one is filmed
Oct 24 2022,positive,this movie was powerfull

Oct 24 2022,positive,very good best movie action and superhero movie of year
Oct 24 2022,positive,its a very enjoyable movie though there are annoying and cringe moments but it was all still good hawkman is such a badarse hopefully wbd gives him a solo spin off movie coz aldis hodge nailed the role 
Oct 24 2022,positive,dceu is back on track this movie is a fantastic soft reboot for the shared universe and adds to the success of the suicide squad fantastic movie any plot weaknesses are made up for by amazing action
Oct 24 2022,positive,exceeds expectations grand explosive
Oct 24 2022,positive,surprisingly a fun time really enjoyed it in 4dx and will be going back to watch it soon
Oct 24 2022,positive,it is action right from the get go i can see why critics dont like it but if entertainment is your main goal for the night then you wont be disappointed  popcorn flick a 610 movie
Oct 24 2022,negative,the rock missed his mark this movie is horrible on all levels it makes a mockery of dc and shows that the studios and actors have no soul anymore late stage capitalism has reduced entertainment to corporate drool this movie shows the lack of acting creativity and direction that hollywood use to be known for i would not recommend this movie to anyone even when it starts streaming for free we need a new rock to hide under
Oct 24 2022,positive,a fun movie yes they bring the same typical styles of the rock badass and imposing
Oct 24 2022,positive,an absolute kickass action blockbuster proving that dceu has a bright future ahead led by the rock
Oct 24 2022,positive,its a must see highly recommend the movie
Oct 24 2022,positive,loved the movie the whole audience at the theater i was in were laughing the whole time w movie
Oct 24 2022,positive,this is what a superhero movie should be not that absolute shitshow marvel did in she hulk and ms marvel
Oct 24 2022,positive,i really enjoyed this movie for its ambition and taking so many characters and introducing them to the dceu story isnt anything crazy but its such a good time that i really didnt care
Oct 24 2022,positive,ill be the first to admit not being a fanatical follower of dwayne but the film is  very entertaining not a masterpiece but its worth a matinee ticket the rock wasnt well overly thr rock and the humor was laid out well and not cheesy just my opinion i will say i was quite impressed with dr fate and with how hawkman were portrayed i got tchalla vibes from hawkman and it was done well wouldnt mind seeing more of them justicesocietyofamerica
Oct 24 2022,positive,finally dc has done it right with this movie i am definitely going to see it again
Oct 24 2022,positive,great return from dc back to basics we loved the story the action and the introduction of the justice society
Oct 24 2022,positive,very good movie it reminded me of the essence of dc
Oct 24 2022,positive,this movie was a blast a pleasant surprise
Oct 24 2022,positive,some of the best action in all of dceu hopefully for the next movie they keep that level of excitement and just improve on the writing
Oct 24 2022,positive,a great new origin story that also uses the foundation seen in the comics a film youll laugh and cheer for not only the villainous side but also all sides the third act does get jampacked and some aspects of the story could have been removed or changed in sequence to make a more meaningful connection for our antihero all in all its a really good and fun film not one that disappoints true comic fans dwayne johnson said it was for the fans and he delivered on his promise
Oct 24 2022,positive,its a great movie i had a good time
Oct 24 2022,positive,loved the movie enjoyed every second of it
Oct 24 2022,positive,if anyone have a problem with this movie ethoss getting paid off or something mentally is wrong with them i love the movie so much action everyone put their best out there and i cant wait for a part 2 and whatever the dceu has in store
Oct 24 2022,negative,possibly one of the worst movies i have ever seen it was so bad that i got up and walked out less than halfway through it dont waste your money on this one
Oct 24 2022,positive,i love this movie the rock is so explosive and  strong i love all characters they have heart and we love the action
Oct 24 2022,positive,the rock has natural charisma thats already known for comic book movie wb does a great job sticking to source material this just shows giving the fans what they want pays off great action decent background story the main bad guy was ok lol but overall a popcorn movie flick thats worth seeing
Oct 24 2022,positive,story line is a little jumpy great action need more of a back story and less characters
Oct 24 2022,positive,aside from cyclone the movie had great characters a coherent story and fantastic ending great stuff ahead for the dc universe
Oct 24 2022,positive,i have enjoyed every minute of the movie  thanks dc and thanks dwanta for all the good work and inspiration you give to the world its about time its about power 
Oct 24 2022,positive,the action the humor the cinematography and the acting were all on point a good time from start to finish probably going to see it again
Oct 24 2022,positive,i really like schlocky action so it was a big win for me i think the other heroes was ok but they really didnt feel like heroes taking orders from who they do feels like they are pretty evil
Oct 24 2022,positive,make no mistake this movie is getting a lot of flack for similar things that critics praise the mcu for this movie is a good time and by no means is high art but it definitely isnt trying to be buy some popcorn see it on the biggest screen with the loudest speakers possible and have fun dwayne johnsons passion for the title character is evident and you gotta respect him for it i definitely want to visit this world and the jsa again and i am excited to see what that end credit scene means for the future of dc films go out and see it
Oct 24 2022,positive,fully entertaining some good jokes soundtrack and vfx were really good some of them were not it was way better than the rest of the series and movies that marvel has been releasing
Oct 24 2022,positive,some parts of the movie were a bit much with hawkman and dr fate in some scenes but overall it was a good movie  maybe the low expectations from critic ratings made it seem better but i was happy with it
Oct 24 2022,positive,incredible movies made me super excited to see more about the dceu
Oct 24 2022,positive,dislike  i feel the storyline could have been better i think that supermans part should have been prior to the previews because mostly everyone was already gone i only saw it because i was gathering my things up and i was almost out the theater when i heard amand waller speaking like  i think dwayne johnson and the characters did a good job with the material i loved that superman showed up no matter how small his part was
Oct 24 2022,positive,a fun action filled awesome time in the theater one of the more enjoyable dc movies
Oct 24 2022,positive,lots of violence nonstop the rock was somewhat funny with his sarcasm
Oct 24 2022,positive,great movie exciting for the beggining to the end action and epic
Oct 24 2022,positive,i love rocks so much the dc universe will get better and better in the future i wish there was a dr fate 
Oct 24 2022,positive,this movie was everything it needed to be perhaps not a cinematic masterpiece but it made the popcorn taste better and thats all it really needed the sfx the rock and the fight scenes were all great
Oct 24 2022,positive,it wasnt great plot wise but i loved the fights and cgi
Oct 24 2022,positive,the movie was good very funny i didnt like how we were introduced to the justice society they acted like we knew them and were suppose to care about them but we didnt
Oct 24 2022,positive,this movie has a very weak script and plot but who comes to such films for some kind of plot the most important thing is that there is a cool and memorable and epic action with beautiful effects and also the brutal dwayne the rock johnson in the title role although as an actor he is not very in general this is a tolerable militant for once
Oct 24 2022,neutral,through no fault of the rock except for his inexplicably american accent for a quasi middle easternistan 5000 year old character this movie is just another example of what dc gets wrong and marvel occasionally gets right it starts with 5 minutes of exposition for a movies worth of story introduces a slew of superheroes we neither know nor care about and an organization we have not heard of that seems like justice league lite  we have the equivalents of dr strange ant man storm and sort of a thorfalconluke cage hybrid all just dropped on us with practically no backstory and very little character development what a mess the rock deserved a better script and director
Oct 24 2022,positive,its all you wanted or not in the superhero movie  it does bring massive lights for dc universe  and for sure marvel is dead
Oct 24 2022,negative,pathetic waste of time
Oct 24 2022,positive,im not sure what critics are critical of  fun popcorn movie  you wont leave the theatre smarter but the rocks charisma is undeniable  enjoyed it  wouldnt say immensely but its fun
Oct 24 2022,positive,saw the trailer looks sick and awesome must see
Oct 24 2022,positive,the best movie on 2022 heroes
Oct 24 2022,negative,a lot of fun moments but meh story 
Oct 24 2022,negative,really good special effects but the story was all over the place there were characters that were not needed just a mess
Oct 24 2022,positive,this movie is fun and has no shortage of pure testosterone something so needed in comic book movies today
Oct 24 2022,positive,great action movie the plot made sense one of the best dc movies lets see if they can keep the consistency up though
Oct 24 2022,positive,lots of action  love dwayne  plot could be better  was expecting an antihero  pierce brosnan a huge  as dr fate  henry cavill cameo in the end left me screaming my lungs out  overall enjoyed the film
Oct 24 2022,positive,the movie has a solid story and is great visually super entreating overall it is not a 5 cause the acting department lacked the rock was kind robotic imo but it is not a deal breaker
Oct 24 2022,positive,i wont say its a masterpiece its not revolutionary either but this is an amazing movie entertaining funny action sequences are so good teth adam and hawkman are badass
Oct 24 2022,positive,just what super hero movies should look like they could have a better story but given the period in which it was made it is a miracle that it even had a chance to see the light of day
Oct 24 2022,positive,my son and i saw this on friday i have to say although there were some slow unnecessary justice society issues we really enjoyed the movie dwayne johnson performed the role well and without smiling atom smasher and cyclone were minor characters and didnt contribute much why were they chosen for the mission aldis hodge as hawkman and pierce brosnan as dr fate were perfect i chuckled when i saw henry winkler my son has no idea who he is for a superhero movie or antihero movie this was a good one the action scenes were the best part i wish they had elaborated more on the eternium aspect but maybe that will come up again in the future
Oct 24 2022,positive,super refreshing movie enjoyed it a lot for its action and characters
Oct 24 2022,positive,action packed excellent cinematography fun and entertaining loved it
Oct 24 2022,positive,best hero movie of the time leaves us with nostalgia for how a hero movie should be made with plenty of action and conical characters
Oct 24 2022,positive,this movie restore my faith in dceu
Oct 24 2022,positive,like terrell owens said get the popcorn ready    this film is nonstop action and tells the story in a great way that works there are twists and turns that no one saw coming with each one everyone in the packed theater would ohhh and ahhh     if you are sick of the formulaic marvel films this is the movie for you one negative is the kid in the film cant act
Oct 24 2022,positive,there werent any vfx in this movie the rock just used his natural abilities
Oct 24 2022,positive,the movie was fantastic yes the cgi was funny sometimes but the story the continuation the future building the subtle cameos except for the one at the end they were all beautiful to watch loved it the cameo at the end made it even better please dont bring snyder back tho
Oct 24 2022,positive,heck with the movie critics who panned this film  i thought this movie was action packed and had plot twists that i enjoyed and it helped understand this antiheros origin story
Oct 24 2022,positive,i thought the movie was very good and the critics are complaining about nothing and they are wrong watch this film its so much better to then most mcu films
Oct 24 2022,positive,an action packed superhero movie with a very coherent story  fantastic cast this one has to put dc back on track epic on every level
Oct 24 2022,positive,it was a cute dc story  spoiler  im a dwqyne johnson fan
Oct 24 2022,positive,thin on plot but had good ideas loved dr fate and would definitely watch a film about him 
Oct 24 2022,positive,love the movie idc what everyone else saids people will find anything to say to put someone down
Oct 24 2022,positive,fun movie better than most recent marvel films besides nwh
Oct 24 2022,positive,excellent story great action and beautiful visuals  the rock did a great job
Oct 24 2022,positive,outstanding movie with plot twists and good dialog and the best end credit scene since ironman
Oct 24 2022,neutral,all flash no story
Oct 24 2022,positive,movie was amazing tons of action funny moments and a few scenes that were tugging at my heart strings
Oct 24 2022,positive,probably some purists will have issue with a few things  but i enjoyed it  dwayne johnson is excellent  highly recommend
Oct 24 2022,positive,the return of dc i love it
Oct 24 2022,positive,loved all of it the rock was awesome as well as the rest of the cast plenty of action
Oct 24 2022,positive,i loved this movie i wasnt sure what to expect if the dceu had started off with a movie like this itd probably be in a better position today and thank god wb is bringing back cavill
Oct 24 2022,positive,awesome dr fate was dope and the action scenes were sick
Oct 24 2022,positive,im glad that i didnt listen critics movie is not batman begins league but its worth of watching happy to see that dc moving from zero ground
Oct 24 2022,positive,loved it i am so happy to see these heros in live action after such a wait
Oct 24 2022,positive,one of the better dceu movies in a while
Oct 24 2022,positive,not sure why the critics are trashing this movie  its exactly what you hope to see in a superhero movie  i actually liked that they had a lot more action then some others it seemed and they did not over use the comedy  parts like some marvel movies have started to do
Oct 24 2022,positive,i like always marvel movies but this movie really amazing 
Oct 24 2022,positive,amazing movie  loved it from beginning to end 
Oct 24 2022,positive,exciting movie the rock portray it very satisfactory with the story line its a 5 star for me
Oct 24 2022,positive,black adam 2022 is awesome dont listen to critics
Oct 24 2022,negative,please write a better movie
Oct 24 2022,positive,great movie and a great cast i loved the subtle humor if you are a rock fan you will not be disappointed
Oct 24 2022,positive,love the fact that it was of course action packed
Oct 24 2022,positive,great action movie enjoy all the time at 100 the protagonist has a charisma that fills the theater the rock the one and only
Oct 24 2022,positive,this is a prime example of why i hate trusting the critic reviews on this website this movie had an original take on a similar genre and every character had valid reasons for the decisions they made character growth for an indestructible hero is impressive when they could not do the same for captain america and her character suffered from bad writing and a smug attitude but this instance showed the main character actually acting humble for multiple moments regardless of his abilities
Oct 24 2022,positive,absolutely brilliant movie
Oct 24 2022,positive,thoroughly enjoy this movie  back to the gritty dc i remember as a kid
Oct 24 2022,positive,a lot of great action scenes pacing was great but i felt like a lot of the acting was subpar the rocks performance that was great
Oct 24 2022,positive,action packed movie
Oct 24 2022,positive,forgot critics and enjoy the movie this is a family entertainment piece
Oct 24 2022,positive,honestly i thought this movie was amazing first of all its great to see comics book characters that have never been on the big screen finally have their day in the spotlight but have such excellent portrayals is amazing plus im just gonna say it pierce brosnan just killed it as dr fate and im really hoping that both him and hawkman need their own solo films preferably together overall excellent film
Oct 24 2022,positive,best hero movie of last years
Oct 24 2022,positive,i liked how rock was able to be a serious character for once
Oct 24 2022,positive,finally a comic book movie made for adults
Oct 24 2022,positive,overall hell yea you wanted a an action comic movie  bam dwayne the rock johnson just busted his nutz in to face sucka remember in man in steel when you saw two kryptonians godlike fights happen and your were like 0  well the story is cliché but dam this was smhacking yee boi
Oct 24 2022,positive,was very entertaining honestly probably the best dc movie
Oct 24 2022,positive,great for kids and adults   we love it when the good guys triumph
Oct 24 2022,positive,great backstory  action and cg effects were well done  ending was a little too drawn out i am really tired of the undead angle needed more superman
Oct 24 2022,positive,enjoyable well managed scenes and a fast pace so fast that the villain is overshadowed enjoyable and already the rock being the rock
Oct 24 2022,positive,this movie shows why critics are a bad way to gauge how good a movie is my son  i found this movie very enjoyable and had no major issues with it if i had to change anything it would be less of the annoying kid and the corny stuff he said a different ending for dr fate and utilizing the villain with longer screen time at the end act overall very enjoyable and definitely would recommend it
Oct 24 2022,positive,the movie missed a huge opportunity to connect the child in the main storyline to his son he should have started off full villain and brought out of the darkness with the boy as he connects to him as a representation of what his son would want huge missed opportunity i hope as the dc movies go forward they keep the great energy and love for the material and fans but just add a little better scripts loved the movie and cant wait for more
Oct 24 2022,negative,one of the worst superhero films i have ever seen the characters sucked the main kid character is annoying and unlikeable all the other characters are poorly developed and static the tone is all over the place one moment the killing of nameless grunts is for a good laugh and the next its a major point of conflict attempts at humor often fell flat the cgi was atrocious throughout obvious green screen and characters who look poorly rendered the plot was lazily written the film set out a preconceived endpoint and put forth little effort into making the journey to the end seem plausible the constant slomo and awkward action poses at times made the action feel slow and drawn out
Oct 24 2022,positive,dawayne plays the main character need i say more
Oct 24 2022,negative,wow this was bad seems like they made a really bad movie and   tried their best to edit something decent together
Oct 24 2022,positive,this movie is fully pack of action the element of non stop action just makes this movie fun to watch and it didnt boring me at all and i think movie reviewers just dont know what there talking didnt they see the audience score is getting higher by the time this just makes their critics is stupid and didnt give any meaning at all
Oct 24 2022,positive,amazing movie all the time and best of all no militancy
Oct 24 2022,positive,loved it stay for the credits
Oct 24 2022,positive,this is the best movie dc has put out yet  dr fate needs his own stand alone
Oct 24 2022,positive,ignore the critics this is a great movie  will it win any oscars  god no but will it become a favorite of hero and dc movie fans  absolutely this is better than any offering from marvel this year streaming or theatre release  it also introduced fantastic secondary characters from the dc world and had plenty of action   the low low critic scores just serve to show how bias the industry still is to superhero movies and just how out of touch they are with the viewing public
Oct 24 2022,positive,just amazing in everything 
Oct 24 2022,positive,loved it always love dwayne johnson movies
Oct 24 2022,positive,wow this movie will change the dc universe for the better critics need to get out of the marvel mentality we had a great time a must see
Oct 24 2022,positive,i feel that storyline is skipped and pushed toward the action scene only there is no need for a time cut in the movie they should have added an additional 1 hour to make a better storyline and the movie might be perfectly awesome by the way i love film
Oct 24 2022,positive,it was a good start 
Oct 24 2022,positive,lots of action  took the grandson and he loved it  husband slept through some of it  i enjoyed it and would have loved to see more of dwayne johnsons humor  surprise ending  dont leave too early
Oct 24 2022,positive,i found the plot to be quite rushed pushing alot of characters into one film without much background information but the sheer action and humor that is added to this film makes up for the rushed plot dwayne johnsons acting also helped the film and with the end credit scene featuring superman honestly has me hyped besides the rushed plot and rushed characters this film is very worth a watch
Oct 24 2022,positive,one for superhero fans
Oct 24 2022,negative,you need a program to follow all the characters and past plots that contribute to the present characters i found it trite and downright silly  the avengers they aint
Oct 24 2022,positive,this movie was awesome loved it
Oct 24 2022,positive,i am a fan of the rock he is funny and offthewall in a lot of his movies which makes his overthetop characters endearing there is none of that in this movie  just a stoic antihero trying to discover his reason for existence the rock is not meant to play out a 2 hour long existential explanation for a demigod brought back to life after 5000 years this was a middling movie at best and was carried by the supporting cast who brought a lot more life to this movies cheers
Oct 24 2022,positive,best superhero movie since infinity wars
Oct 24 2022,positive,action action and more action this is for me the most essential thing in a superhero movie amazing cgi except in the third act which is the most weak part of the movie    removing some characters and giving a few minutes to develop at least the 2 main characters of the justice society would have made it a mustwatch
Oct 24 2022,positive,it was just enough back story to catch the average nonccomic book reader up to speed while being full of action comedy and heart  i mean dr fate was incredible  give him a standalone origin story and take my money please  this movie is a lot of fun
Oct 24 2022,negative,movie for kids boring story useless plot
Oct 24 2022,positive,yeah its a good movie it has nice vfx and cgi top notch action sequences but  it has some negetive points also like this movie stuck at story telling and its charector buildup but it doesnt boor you the story is weak and its not the origin as we saw at the comics but yeah you will definitely enjoy the movie rocomended
Oct 24 2022,positive,one of the best theater experience   dc rebuilding   watch the audience rating   dont trust this paid critics dumbs
Oct 24 2022,positive,really unexpectedly good thought it was going to be a mixed movie but it was fun action filled emotionally involved its been a while since we saw these kinds of great movie from the studios    the cast was great too everyone did their job well    stop doubting go watch it
Oct 24 2022,positive,it was a genuinely good film having a antihero as the main character was a refreshing change of pace
Oct 24 2022,positive,they could base a dragon ball z movie off the action sequences
Oct 24 2022,positive,a great experience with fun action and hilarious scenes
Oct 24 2022,positive,incredible movie and very important for the extended universe of dc the criticisms that were made to the movie are anything it has great characters and a good plot the costumes and the visual art is magnificent and it is full of epicity and action very funny with good winks in addition to the return of the big s
Oct 24 2022,positive,dont listen to the critics look at the audience score thats what really matters great movie

Oct 24 2022,positive,i liked the movie for its action and added comedy
Oct 24 2022,positive,i loved this movie definitely worth the watch full of action you know what you want to see in superhero movie and actually good cgi and they built his storyline ignore the critic reviews a lot of them sound like jabronis
Oct 24 2022,positive,most amazing movie i have ever seen in dc century i felt goosebumps in every action scenes in this movie i really loved it and hoping more franchises
Oct 24 2022,positive,great balanced hero movie refreshing
Oct 24 2022,negative,everyone knows that when you have a bad story or bad actors but you have a good director no matter what the movie will be great this is clearly the opposite situation the directors perspective is incredible bad the actors did well but the movie on its own is an f it was the first time that i left the cinema 40 minutes early
Oct 24 2022,positive,i greatly enjoyed watching the movie  black adam dr fate and hawkman were all outstanding  i will be seeing it again and bringing my wife and five grandchildren with me this time  definitely way better than anything marvel has put out in recent years
Oct 24 2022,positive,great action plot was explained the rock has saved dcu thank you do not listen to critics
Oct 24 2022,positive,what is not to love first it features the most loved and iconic man in todays world dwayne johnson its a super hero marveldc universe kick butt movie full of action  full of laughs full of thunder and pain it has a great story line point and purpose it gave a back story for those not familiar with tethadam and the teaser at the end was literally the sparkling candle on top the cake    yes it had comical corny shazam moments but it definitely gave something for all ages to love and when it comes to the rock you know hes all about family and making sure everyone enjoys his movies     an absolute must see
Oct 24 2022,positive,i enjoyed the movie a lot the cgi wasnt atrocious which is something to not based on recent superhero movies the storyline was there but the stakes wasnt exactly clear of what the antagonist want i did laugh quite a but though very enjoyable did not expect that
Oct 24 2022,positive,a must watch movie finally a movie that i enjoyed after sometime 
Oct 24 2022,positive,great action  ten of us went ages four to sixtysix years old  the four year old was scared at a few scenes but everyone else enjoyed it  my three boys elementary middle school and college age all enjoyed it i enjoyed it   script wasnt amazing but plenty of action and fun  better than the last couple of marvel movies that came out this year

Oct 24 2022,positive,really good movie dont listen to the goofy ahh critics this film was really good                                    the part where the rock fought morbus was really one of the scenes of all time

Oct 24 2022,positive,as a dc fan this was 1010 they put a lot of love into this movie and i love to see them investing in these kids of projects also seeing the justice society have more charm and connection with each other than the justice league on their first outing was pretty awesome hawk man and dr fate absolutely crushed it and i cant wait to see where the rock takes this awesome character
Oct 24 2022,positive,great movie i laughed i found common ground and enjoyed the movie dont listen to the negative critics go see it loved getting to see all the heroes they brought to the screen
Oct 24 2022,positive,they slowed the moves to many times but still good
Oct 24 2022,positive,my family and i enjoyed the movie and thats all that matters  try going into every movie with low expectations and you will never be disappointed afterwards  the problem with professional critics is that  they do the opposite
Oct 24 2022,positive,great movie about redemption and brings some great heroes to the screen loved it dont listen to the nasty critics go see it for yourself
Oct 24 2022,positive,it may be a typical superhero movie but it still manages to put something different compared to the other past superhero movies that we have seen the cgi was at its best and it aint being rushed the delays were probably worth it to polish this movie
Oct 24 2022,positive,i thought the movie was extremely entertaining it had great action good effects and good characters while the rock never fully disappears behind tethadam he does a good job and brings a level of gravitas to the role the jsa are welcome additions too the weakest element of the movie is the villain but only at the end
Oct 24 2022,positive,great movie 910  critics marvel fanboy got it wrong best comic movie of the year
Oct 24 2022,positive,finally a movie that was able to get me and my family out to the theatre  the whole family enjoyed the movie and my kids were asking me when is part 2 coming good job by the team who put this together
Oct 24 2022,positive,not the hero we wanted but the antihero we deserve a breath of fresh air dwayne took the role seriously however many geoff johns signatures and hamadas as well     cgi itself is top notch  considering how bad the cgi has been for dcs counter company excited for the future of dc
Oct 24 2022,positive,movie critics prove once again why nobody cares about what they say about moviestv series they said she hulk was better than this amazing film  sure it aint perfect but its definitely solid and worth the watch 100 dwayne gave the fans what they wanted what more do you want
Oct 24 2022,positive,slow moving and difficult to connect to the characters storyline was stopstart which made it confusing best parts the action scenes and ending if you choose to go to this movie know that youll check you watch more than once but it is entertaining enough to see it through meh 
Oct 24 2022,positive,it was a good movie to see in theaters but it had a 2010 vibe but stay for that post credit scene
Oct 24 2022,positive,great  action movie great pictures and casting really enjoyed
Oct 24 2022,negative,very bad and uninteresting
Oct 24 2022,positive,the rock is new and fresh in the super hero element new characters in the dc universe introduced is a two thumbs up
Oct 24 2022,negative,i like rock as an actor but this movie was not good at all they repeat the same thing over and over again i did not want to see the end of the movie
Oct 24 2022,neutral,having seen it at the weekend id give it 50 myself it was fun enough but parts were quite boring and the central character wasnt entertaining luckily the other characters were but the main character being a bore and many of the action sequences being just dull dragged it down
Oct 24 2022,positive,it is a good pop corn movie do not believe the critics i enjoyed it a lot
Oct 24 2022,positive,one of the better comic stories that have come to the silver screen lately a well put together origin story if this is a sign of whats to come from the new dc then the future for them is bright 
Oct 24 2022,negative,i dont know why would people lie to themselves and say that this was a good movie action scenes were goodsome too much slow motion even when they are just talking its hilarious i dont even wanna say anything about the kid and his mom they are so bad its undeniable dissapointment
Oct 24 2022,positive,awesome great action story looking forward to more from dwayne johnson
Oct 24 2022,positive,not perfect but a lot of fun to watch and actually had a measure of respect for the source and characters  very ambitious with a contingent of the jsa for the main characters introduction movie  professional reviewers might be becoming obsolete apparently
Oct 24 2022,positive,honestly i dont know whether the critcs and i even went to the same movie this movie was such a nice overhaul of the dc formula while staying almost true to the grit and nuance of the universe the jokes landed the action was tight and the story had more to offer than just a basic plot bestdc movie in years and definitely worth a watch for more than just one time
Oct 24 2022,positive,a new era for dcu a new hope for superhero movies
Oct 24 2022,negative,sad and bad a clear money grab to mimic marvel and to take advantage they do now even worse movies
Oct 24 2022,negative,pierce brosnan was the only good actor in the film the villain was lame the skeletons were silly the child acting was atrocious the film was boring i almost fell asleep if you want to see the rock playing the same character he has always played then youll like this the not a hero thing got super repetitive to the point of cringe
Oct 24 2022,positive,awesome movie for sure dc universe gonna surpass marvel cinematic universe in just a few years
Oct 24 2022,positive,personally the movie was so much fun like riding my favorite rollercoaster enjoyed the plot action scenes  visuals great way to introduce each character in the movie
Oct 24 2022,positive,haters gon hate movie was cray cray
Oct 24 2022,positive,great a must watch movie for all super hero fans  dont listen whatever u hear  just go  enjoy
Oct 24 2022,positive,an epic and entertaining cinematic experience what you want from a superhero film two hours of fun with violent and wellchoreographed fights
Oct 24 2022,positive,exactly how i wanted superhero film to be amazing from beginning to end highly entertaining every character had a chance to shine especially hawkman  doctor fate also go support the film because rock heard the audience and got spoiler back
Oct 24 2022,negative,some ok action sequences but overall just generic and fairly boring characters were even worse direction seemed all over the place and obviously the writing was sub par    id recommend just waiting to see it when it eventually goes to streaming
Oct 24 2022,positive,so good action super midafter credit
Oct 24 2022,positive,i thought the rock did a good job in this role perfect casting the action was great and glad to see a basic superhero story again
Oct 24 2022,negative,might be the worst movie ive seen in my life
Oct 24 2022,positive,my boys and i really enjoyed the movie once the action gets going it doesnt stop the rock does a good job of playing ba it didnt feel like one of his typical movies  the mid credit scene got the 3 of us excited to see what happens with dc next worth the time to go and see
Oct 24 2022,positive,good movie coming from marvel and dc fan this is the best thing for super movies besides the batman all year not a perfect movie but entertaining and beautiful critics are definitely bought out and its never been more noticeable till now
Oct 24 2022,positive,ignore the critics they are sorely out of touch when it comes to comic movies this was a great movie for the dcu it needed a reset
Oct 24 2022,positive,give the people what they want build it and they will come this movie was back to back action packed and to be honest i missed my superhero movies being a clash of fists and ideologies
Oct 24 2022,positive,very good film it change from marvel only comical film that are anoying as hell
Oct 24 2022,positive,a true action epic dc is finally on right track the movie delivered above my expectation
Oct 24 2022,positive,its an amazing experience especially when its the rock starringa movie worth watchingdo not listen to these critics who like to sabotage and ruin the efforts of all the people involved in making this movietrust me you will enjoy this movieand the post credit scene is just amazing 
Oct 24 2022,positive,great movie i really like what the rock is doing in this film and you can tell that hes a fan of dc the action scenes in this are amazing as well
Oct 24 2022,positive,everything works but its flaw might be the pacing
Oct 24 2022,negative,quite the letdown dispite good performance from brosnan and an refreshingly toned down dwayne the rock johnson  the justice society worked well but we need a much better introduction of these characters  much of the action was well done and entertaining but the final fight turned into a silly cgi mess the look of the big bad was terrible and looked like it could have been done in the 90   terrible dialogue and a few questionable performances  all in all an ok popcorn movie but far from what it could and should have been
Oct 24 2022,positive,amazing movie to watch and much more real looking vfx is used in it  i would totally recommend you to watch it
Oct 24 2022,positive,went into this movie with low expectations and i was shockingly surprised as to how good this film was it was fun with jokes that hit has me pumped for whats next in the dc universe the cast was a great bunch of characters i tended to the kid a little too much but i guess its bc they had to find check that box of target audience pierce brosnan and his costar hawkman was absolutely wonderful i would totally rewatch this film there was so much action
Oct 24 2022,positive,absolute banger for a film  dont listen to the critics theyre deluded self righteous pompous know it alls  this is an amazing movie and deserves every bit of success its  getting  please do yourself a favour go and watch it 
Oct 24 2022,positive,it was a good moviethe critics rated it so poorly which it definitely didnt deserve and thats why i rated 5 stars there to give it justice but for me   its 710  which includes midcredit scene 
Oct 24 2022,positive,the rock você sempre será famoso
Oct 24 2022,positive,the movie is one of the best comic book movies ever made
Oct 24 2022,positive,i actually really enjoyed the movie its not as bad as the critics make it out to be yes the story isnt that great but the characters and the action make up for it loved the end credits scene and i hope they make a black adam 2 soon
Oct 24 2022,positive,dwayne the rock johnson
Oct 24 2022,positive,love it the plot is ok i guess but the action was frickin awesome seeing people get bodied in a dc film is always lit but i love this film because they werent trying to make dudes feel inferior
Oct 24 2022,positive,im not a critic  just a regular person that occasionally goes to cinema i went without expectations and i loved it it was funny without trying too hard to get a laugh full of action and also moving in parts i laughed i even cried at one point and i was on the edge of my seat throughout
Oct 24 2022,positive,great action good effects
Oct 24 2022,positive,loved it it was funny but not overly funny that it makes the movie look like a joke the end credit scene was the best thing ive seen in a while
Oct 24 2022,positive,i dont get the hate from critics i enjoyed this movie and so did my wife i am excited for the future of dc
Oct 24 2022,positive,its great    dead pan funny    great actors and characters    is it perfect  no but what movie actually is universally perfect     its fresh air to the dcu that was badly in needed    yes atom smasher is the comedy relief but this version of the character is a rookie  rookies screw up and most of the other comedy is dead pan the guy has been sleeping for thousands of years and new stuff is constantly around him    watch it for yourself if youre on the fence go online and find a theater that does cheap tickets on certain days thats what i did and found a theater that sells tickets for 7 on sundays in a dbox theater whatever that means
Oct 24 2022,positive,loved this movie it was definitely underrated
Oct 24 2022,positive,yep dc is back with a punch gotta watch it to understand what is about to happen

Oct 24 2022,positive,a ton of fun    i enjoyed it and the critics dont understand anything about what the fans enjoy

Oct 24 2022,positive,amazing fucken movie fuck the workers who got a job to review the movie they just dick ride marvel and accept anything that has marvel on it one of the best top 3 movies i ever seen amazing beautiful everything

Oct 24 2022,positive,thoroughly enjoyed this movie
Oct 24 2022,positive,the movie was entertaining and thats all most people desire in such a movie i didnt expect another godfather or gone with the wind and yes i have seen both recently and enjoyed them immensely    black adam was the first movie i had seen during the pandemic i was wondering if it would be worth the risk if there was enough spectacle and flash to justify seeing it in the theater    and there was    this movie really points out a problem with rotten tomatoes    there is simply no point in using rotten tomatoes to gauge whether a film is entertaining or not the critics have no interest in rating a film along those lines    further rt is just a giant obstacle to anyone trying to figure out if they will enjoy said movie    remember if its a quality film like jane eyre we simply rent or stream it
Oct 24 2022,positive,amazing i hope for a bright future for dc
Oct 24 2022,positive,it was an awesome movie vfx and fights were absolutely incredible fight scenes were majestic i mean its a proper action movie really loved dr fate and hawkman
Oct 24 2022,positive,went in with low expectations and to be honest it tuned out much better than expected however still story ia flat repetitive and the combined super heroes make no sense whatsoever i mean it looks like they just came up with whoever they can get a license for overall it doesnt stink but still very disappointing for dc fans
Oct 24 2022,positive,absolutely loved this movie a great movie for the dceu the story wasnt everything but it was funny but not too funny it was a great joy to see where everything is going
Oct 24 2022,positive,i cant take this movie out of my mind is a movie with an action so intense that make you want to see more with finally dialogues that are not all goofy and is rich with story and inspiration i love that movie the snyder cut has already saved dc but this one did the same thing too
Oct 24 2022,positive,this movie was a great time go see it 
Oct 24 2022,positive,best dc movie so far
Oct 24 2022,positive,black adam is a complete action movie color grading and vfx are included in this movie is cool i like this movie but i am not satisfied with the storyline and the character of  dr fate a weak fate different from animations dwayne johnson gave a great performance as black adam rich in action and vfx this film gives a good theater experience 810
Oct 24 2022,positive,finally a violent blunt pg13 movie for once in a film some twists caught me off guard
Oct 24 2022,positive,unbelievable film dwayne johnson was born to play this role cant wait for the future of dc
Oct 24 2022,positive,for the first time the rock didnt feel like the rock in every movie great action scenes the plot could use some help maybe less of the kids cringyness overall a good step for dc in their cinematic universe

Oct 24 2022,positive,this is the best dc film since the dark knight and the best comic book movie this year thank you the rock
Oct 24 2022,positive,after 2 let downs being strange 2 and thor 4 was good to watch a superhero movie that had the fun popcorn action done well not perfect obviously but like the venom movies it doesnt have to change the world of cinema for you to enjoy your time watching the story does a serviceable job and characters can range from great to ok recommended for superhero action done well
Oct 24 2022,positive,recomment but i want the jsas acting must less more because they just catch the spotlight from teth adam
Oct 24 2022,positive,most violent dceu film so far its a fun action movie that doesnt need much else all the main protagonists were fantastic in their roles
Oct 24 2022,negative,the rocks popularity will not be enough to save this one terrible

Oct 24 2022,positive,absolutely fun and set up for even a greater dc future
Oct 24 2022,positive,entertening funny in the best line of the dc universe but still needs a little more substance a little more like the marvel movies just saying
Oct 24 2022,positive,it was fun and enjoyable movie
Oct 24 2022,positive,treat to the eyes excitement and connection with the characters is brilliant as well
Oct 24 2022,positive,was not disappointed at all it was so good i have considered going back to watch it again it looks like critics dont get the point that a movie should deliver to what the audiences want dwayne johnson gets it thats why he has become as successful as he has 
Oct 24 2022,positive,very entertaining film but various story elements were farfetched and narration at the beginning is a little weird  however it makes up for it with great action scenes characters and settings  also it is one of the few movies ive seen this year that does cgi correctly and convincingly to where you really appreciated characters like dr fate even more  dwayne johnson and pierce brosnan did an amazing job supporting cast was also fun to watch      overall i felt it was well worth the increased movie ticket price
Oct 24 2022,positive,really good introduction movie cgi is just amazing  post credit scene is perfect and character casting is superb  tons of action must watch dont get fooled by critics biased reviews
Oct 24 2022,positive,good action sequences  characters costumes were comic accurate
Oct 24 2022,positive,its gud movieaction packed but they didnt much focused on story pacing was bit weird and weak villain but worth to watch in theatres vfxsound effects was amazing but its bad in few scenes sometimes felt like action and slowmo are overused and repetitive
Oct 24 2022,positive,the movie delivered at bringing one of the most powerful characters dc has to live action and made him seem as powerful as he is supposed to be while some of the twists and results were clear when they were set up they still result in enjoyable viewing
Oct 24 2022,positive,its not perfect there some issues and flop but its really enjoyable thats the most important thing from the movie entertain the audiences after watched again for the second time it makes me understand more about this movie the thing that i tought it was mistake its has purpose and honour for dwayne thee rock jhonson all of his effort to make dc great again
Oct 24 2022,positive,watch the film at least once 
Oct 24 2022,positive,this was a great movie took the whole family to see it and its great to see dc start listening to the fans
Oct 24 2022,positive,a good recycled start of the decu full of action if you blink youll miss it and the post credit scene omg you have to watch the movie at least 2 times
Oct 24 2022,positive,i enjoyed it completely it had lots of action suspense as well as some sadness
Oct 24 2022,positive,action  cgi mostly  storywise is soso

Oct 24 2022,positive,amazing cant wait for the rest
Oct 24 2022,positive,action scenes are awesome the plot itself reminded me of the classic marvel formula of the hero gets powers and ends with the hero defeating a villain with similar powers overall pretty fun
Oct 24 2022,positive,fun exciting a great group of super heroes well done definitely worth watching
Oct 24 2022,positive,wow this is first time after snyders version when dc movie was sooo good first of all incredible graphics actors chosen very well fully suit the their characters the rock is perfect the story is good i like this movie

Oct 24 2022,positive,dwayne johnson as a superhero was a well calculated risk

Oct 24 2022,positive,great movie  love the graphics action packed with a storyline and plot  henry cavill welcome back
Oct 24 2022,neutral,casting and acting were great as was cinematography special effects the plot was weak too long spent on blowing up things and fight scenes not enough dialogue or lead in to the story how did the human characters keep appearing in the same place when they were immediately in a different part of town what was the point of the walking dead at the end why did they awake just to fight the mother and her brother no where else in town why did they have to stay and fight them superfluous poor editing in my opinion
Oct 24 2022,positive,entertaining a fun time
Oct 24 2022,positive,exciting movie with many surprises
Oct 24 2022,positive,loved it the rock was born to play this character this is a new era of dc went to galaxy theaters oh and i really have never and dont care about what rotten tomatoes and its critics think or say they are irrelevant clearly they have been bought off by another studio i have never and will never consult rt score when making decisions on what to watch
Oct 24 2022,positive,movie was amazing the action the visuals the dc we all want
Oct 24 2022,positive,i will say that this is definitely pushing my top 3 for super hero movies for 2022 along with the batman and doctor strange the effects were stunning  i loved the use of the cgi not too much but its definitely present in the movie this was overall a great jumpstart that dc really needed at the moment and i hope upcoming projects follow this same formula and style
Oct 24 2022,positive,great movie highly recommended
Oct 24 2022,positive,very good movie enjoyable from start to finish super entertaining hopefully it will have a sequel
Oct 24 2022,positive,dont trust the critics the movie is a decent block buster with action scenes and good vfx than most of the marvel movies

Oct 24 2022,positive,the movie was awesome with great action
Oct 24 2022,neutral,i think we all know by now not to expect too much from a dc film so there is no disappointment dr fate was the main attraction here if i could control the future i would have placed his name on the movie title

Oct 24 2022,negative,theres entertaining parts and the rock and pierce brosnan are decent but the pacing is terrible  especially towards the end
Oct 24 2022,positive,surprisingly i enjoyed this movie towards the beginning i thought it was just a low budget take on marvel characters but i ended up enjoying the film it was actionpacked along with comedy
Oct 24 2022,positive,i like the length of the movie the action scenes were good cgi was pretty good except for when they tried to place the rocks face on another body i loved the twists the storyline was interesting but there was an introduction of too many new characters which were cool but confusing at the same time overall it was enjoyable and woth the 100 plus dollars we paid as a family to watch it

Oct 24 2022,negative,street kid toying with international terrorist smacking demons from hell with a skateboard  escaping on a skateboard lame dialogues and very disconnected storyline it was horrible experience to watch the rock in this film
Oct 24 2022,positive,great movie dwayne fight to be adam and it was worth it incredible performance and gave the greatest gift for fans hope in dc thank you so much the rock society of justice we surely want more some things in the script were not very good but may improve in the future and the future is amazing after years
Oct 24 2022,positive,i would say it could be nicer if atom smasher has more role than just stay there cracking cringe jokes but any overall is good

Oct 24 2022,positive,id give this a 7 out of 10 feels like dc for better and worse the rock does better than expected here plot is quite predictable id say watch this for dr fate on screen total mindblowing

Oct 24 2022,positive,perfect movie it held me until the end
Oct 24 2022,positive,fun and entertaining
Oct 24 2022,positive,its a fun superhero flick with tons of epic action as a fan of the characters i had a great time some parts may have been a little drawn out the balance between character development and action skewed heavily in favor of action but at the end of the day it isnt much of an issue given the superhero genre id watch it again
Oct 24 2022,positive,its been a long while since ive seen a movie of such caliber though the plot and or story was a bit obvious it is completely malleable with the comic book bash and smash and ask questions later theme     i completely loved it
Oct 24 2022,positive,good and better than most dc films
Oct 24 2022,positive,best movie ive seen this year
Oct 24 2022,positive,an excellent world building movie for dccu dwayne johnson killed the part dr fate and hawkeye were incredibly represented
Oct 24 2022,positive,this movie was extremely good dwayne johnson was a great choice for the lead role and nailed every scene he was in hawkman and doctor fate were great as well
Oct 24 2022,positive,unlike the critics im a simple man who with a movie like this is big kid at heart give me what a kid who reads comics want a hero a villain a person or place to save and lots and lots of action thats what this movie delivered the action was almost non stop they didnt dwell on social issues that we are tired of being preached to by hollywood and critic elites whose moral campuses are near none existent  dc and marvel if yall make more of these instead of trying to preach to us about morals yall dont exercise yourself youll have a lot more people watching your movies
Oct 24 2022,positive,loved it the rock really played the role to the t and also the protagonist was very well written
Oct 24 2022,positive,great action packed movie a breathe of fresh air coming for the dc universe a must watch
Oct 24 2022,positive,the whole movie was good and the end credit scene
Oct 24 2022,positive,look good so amazing perfect and i love this the rock
Oct 24 2022,positive,rotten tomatoes is trying to stop people from reviewing this movie for some reason this is my 3rd attempt trying to give it a well earned 5 stars great movie definitely worth watching in the theaters
Oct 24 2022,positive,it didnt make why the justice society wanted to imprison adam so badly adam kills bad guys justice society spends their time trying to save the bad guys from adam this justice society should really be called the we feel threatened by people stronger than us society
Oct 24 2022,positive,loved the movie its awesome our entire family loved it
Oct 24 2022,positive,my 12 yr old son said it was the best movie hes seen this year
Oct 24 2022,negative,hated it hard to follow plot   very disappointing  almost complete cg
Oct 24 2022,positive,this is why you go to the movies fun exciting and epic the ending meandered a bit but overall great to see these heroes on the big screen
Oct 24 2022,positive,other than a kid that couldnt act and a middling script this was a blast i love that dc is willing to give us darker heroes than marvel though i love marvel as well and pierce brosnan was fantastic and of course i was thrilled with a cameo appearance from a certain actor in a certain role
Oct 24 2022,positive,it definitely had faulty parts but the rock was just so entertaining i really dont care i would watch this multiple times and have it as my background movie when it comes out his exchange with the justice league was my favorite
Oct 24 2022,positive,great carefree fun if you can go into this without a hypercritical take there is a entertaining movie sure it has a few flaws but definitely one of the most enjoyable movies i seen in awhile
Oct 24 2022,positive,dope a lot of twists and turns and action also a surprise guest at the end
Oct 24 2022,positive,it was fun movie im hoping they can kick it up a notch and start making great dc movies hopefully this will be the start
Oct 24 2022,positive,awesome movie the rock and justice society was original action packed likable characters and all around fun to watch also definitely enjoy the mid credit scene looking forward to whats next
Oct 24 2022,positive,this movie was amazing love every moment of it
Oct 24 2022,positive,it was pretty good dont really have much to say about besides it was good i would recommend it to anyone who loves action and or super heroes
Oct 24 2022,positive,ive gotta say this was a good time and kind of charming in a really silly turn your brain off kind of way  dr fate cyclone and the atom smasher are the standouts even though the latter two have way less screen time than id like  i think that both the critics scores and audience scores are way off as its neither as bad as the critics are saying nor is it as good as audiences are saying   overall id give it a 69 if you can get past the messy plot some really bad dialogue and the fact that its just kind of a patchwork of cool ideas from other better comic book movies then theres plenty of action spectacle and dwayne johnson eyebrow acting to make it a mindnumbingly fun watch  down a bootlegger take some buddies and have a stupidly fun time emphasis on the stupid    also a lot of the audience score reviews seem to be almost copypastes of the same templates so follow with caution because theres definitely something funny going on there cough henry cavill cough
Oct 24 2022,positive,way better than i thought it would be had the right amount of storyaction and action glad to see dc is expanding more than just batman the future might be bright but its going to be a long path
Oct 24 2022,positive,henry canvil is back
Oct 24 2022,positive,great movie me and my girl enjoyed it action packed
Oct 24 2022,positive,this movie was amazing the rock put everything into this movie and it payed off cant wait for more in the future
Oct 24 2022,positive,it had lots of action since we are older we got the humor and the one liners not sure why folks wanted the rocks charisma  he us playing a divided villain and hero it has some slow moments but overall was good
Oct 24 2022,positive,great movie highly recommend to everybody
Oct 24 2022,positive,refreshing and not ruined by fun and jokes also dr fate was absolute fire 
Oct 24 2022,positive,i strongly recommend the movie for those who enjoys superhero movies and a lot of action this is the movie the visual effects were excellent the photoshoot and the slow motion acts were amazingly well done
Oct 24 2022,positive,movie was fun and an excellent family movie
Oct 24 2022,positive,loved it the justice society was a great addition to this movie as well hoping to see more of all these characters
Oct 24 2022,positive,simple fun super hero movie with a refreshing main character im a big fan of the character and how dwayne johnson plays him
Oct 24 2022,positive,simply awesome as a antihero movie theres some decisions that couldve been different but overall its great
Oct 24 2022,positive,didnt blow me away but it was fun and the action was good just a solid and entertaining flick hawkman and doctor fate were better than i expected dwayne johnson was dwayne johnson not over the top humor but it has some it even had a little heart  more than anything it kind of lifted my expectations for future dceu movies hopefully they can use this and flash to finally give the universe some direction
Oct 24 2022,positive,lots of action and fun
Oct 24 2022,positive,the movie was was good johnson played the anti hero very well with introduction of hawkman and dr fate dc has introduced new upcoming movies

Oct 24 2022,positive,lots of action really amazing movie must watch
Oct 24 2022,positive,awesome  its like when you pay for a superhero action movie  get a best one from the great one
Oct 24 2022,positive,very entertaining it kept out attention the entire time its a twist on the typical hero vs villain movie our 10year old loved it we loved it
Oct 24 2022,positive,finally a superhero movie i can watch again and again this is what marvel lacks a true champion
Oct 24 2022,positive,this is a superhero movie that promises you action delightfully campy dialog humorous oneliners and good vs evil  it delivers on its promises and even gives some thought provoking ideas that there are grey areas of justice and morality of the nature of its dispensing  so in my opinion it did what it was meant to and sprinkled in some extra and what critics do unfortunately is judge these types of films harshly for not being shakespeare i was highly entertained and in todays world we desperately need that kind of reprieve
Oct 24 2022,positive,a very fun movie the plot is predictable but i really enjoyed it 
Oct 24 2022,positive,one of the best dc  movies better than any other superhero movies since end game
Oct 24 2022,positive,fun action packed antihero hero movie everyone on point in this flick dj killed it
Oct 24 2022,positive,good solid 710 the scores really shows that the critics really doesnt represent the audience therefore no one should trust them
Oct 24 2022,positive,best superhero movie of the year
Oct 24 2022,positive,loved it so did my kids and wife buying it as soon as it comes out on amazon prime
Oct 24 2022,positive,great superhero film about honoring grief and overcoming rage
Oct 24 2022,positive,critcs are disconected from fans and reality also i suspect that those bad call critics  have recived pays of disneymarvel
Oct 24 2022,positive,really great movie i enjoyed it a lot
Oct 24 2022,positive,i was a little nervous because of all the bad critic reviews but its another fine example of why the critics dont matter theres definitely more to come from this dc has a bright future ahead  also just abolish the critic scores already
Oct 24 2022,positive,honestly  really good crazy end
Oct 24 2022,positive,great movie dceu future is back on track
Oct 24 2022,neutral,too much cgi that was not well done
Oct 24 2022,positive,one of the best dc movies yet i dont think the critics watched the same movie as the actual fans did
Oct 24 2022,negative,a very bizarre film with no structure all out action sequences with no build up or coherence and very poorly developed characters post credit scene was easily better than the entire film
Oct 24 2022,positive,pretty good all around occasional corny dialog but for most part great action and funny moments probably best dc film next to snider cut of jl and has me excited for what the future holds
Oct 24 2022,positive,fun action packed great all around step forward for dc
Oct 24 2022,positive,great antihero movie i ever saw
Oct 24 2022,positive,this movie was really well made  the only issue i have with the movie is the rushed special effects and the clunky dialogue i love the rock in all his movies and he does a good job but dc has a long way to go as far as building up trust with the audiences that watch films pierce brosnan is perfectly cast as dr fate and aldis hodge does a great job portraying hawkman this is the first time that the jsa has been in a dc film and if they were introduced first instead of the justice league their film universe would have been great from the start dcs issue was in trying to compete with marvel they should have just done what they did when they were making comic books just make comics and let the audience decide for themselves whether the product was worth reading or not this movie is worth watching
Oct 24 2022,positive,it is an amazing rollercoaster of fun and visual brilliance   creating a team and origin srory in one movie had been tried and failed but this movie does it flawlessly
Oct 24 2022,positive,loved it waited since it was announced so many years ago and not disappointed
Oct 24 2022,positive,despite the hokey dialog i actually loved it
Oct 24 2022,positive,great movie does not follow the canon
Oct 24 2022,positive,amazing movie the 2 hours went by really fast and the characters where good it really makes you want to know more about them especially dc fate and hawkman amon could have a little less screentime though
Oct 24 2022,positive,i can feel all the love of dwayne in this movie its an epic adventure full action and has a great cgi maybe the history isn the best but is entertainig and very enjoyable  the rock brings order in to the dc universe  black adam its a great movie
Oct 24 2022,negative,this was an incredibly dull movie the rock doesnt do much except look stern and whisper a few lines he mainly just poses while the camera circles around him cgi does all the heavy lifting the script is a mess i rolled my eyes so many times i think i pulled an eye muscle the popcorn and coke were pretty good though i went to get refills a few times without worry of missing anything important
Oct 24 2022,positive,i really really enjoyed the movie my family and friends who went to the cinema with me left the movie theater impressed by how brutal the rock was and the incredible special effects i found it very satisfying to watch lol although it is true that the plot and development of characters deserves more work the rest compensates it was worth the entrance i paid
Oct 24 2022,positive,forget the critics please go see this movie  its an absolute blast  action is non stop such a fun ride  cant wait to own this movie when it comes out
Oct 24 2022,positive,very fun movie  couple story plots were a little off but overall good 
Oct 24 2022,positive,it was great worth watching
Oct 24 2022,positive,lots of action and matched the comic book characters
Oct 24 2022,positive,not a bad movie there was the storyline the action scenes and of course the after credit scene  it was different to see mr johnson play a super hero movie
Oct 24 2022,positive,fun and entertaining another winner from the rock
Oct 24 2022,negative,very poor acting cast and script its seems dc cant get one right
Oct 24 2022,positive,good action  loved dwayne johnson in the role
Oct 24 2022,positive,movie was really good     action packed  and more from the dark type      well worth the money     so all these wwe fan virgins from rotten tomatoes  giving bad ratings   go suck a d     dorks living in theres moms basement
Oct 24 2022,positive,intro to new characters story line  wasnt too long
Oct 24 2022,positive,action sequence and the cgi was fantastic end credit scene along was awesome justice society was great everything else about the movie is terrible story was weak acting by everyone was terrible only dynamic that i found worked was the justice society
Oct 24 2022,positive,this was a great movie  i watched this movie because dwayne johnson is in it  i must admit i went into it uncertain of how it would be but was pleasantly surprised and was drawn into this movie right away it has lots of action and a great story line
Oct 24 2022,positive,awesome movie i want to see it again
Oct 24 2022,positive,this movie was awesome the actors were great and the rock was a beast
Oct 24 2022,positive,the movie showed a new way for dc much better than jl need more tweaking but a good start for new dc movies
Oct 24 2022,positive,simply fantastic movie the rock dwayne johnson acted like a god literally in my opinion and in the rocks its the best movie hes ever made i agree that at first i thought that the graphic effects were weak but then i realized the idea i realized the work of art that this film is simply fantastic i recommend it and i loved the acting and participation of everyone in the film                                                                                    stay for the post credit scene
Oct 24 2022,positive,i was not expecting much going into it this movie truly surprised me i loved the culture of kahndaq they portrayed it very well in both modern day and historical contexts the rock did an amazing job playing the character
Oct 24 2022,positive,fun action packed thrill ride of an antihero story
Oct 24 2022,positive,the best movie ever
Oct 24 2022,positive,could have been more aligned with comic
Oct 24 2022,positive,im not gonna lie i really enjoyed this film  this is a great step in the right direction for dc films hopefully their other films will take some notes
Oct 24 2022,positive,totally great  it is one of the best superhero movies i have seen the hawkman and dr fate are excellent
Oct 24 2022,negative,why cant dc make a straight solid movie this started out relatively strong and quickly burnt out to a mess despite some pretty cool performances by pierce brosnan and aldis hodge  the rock was lackluster and just seemed to phone this one in  while everyone else seemed to hold their own outside of noah centineo as atom smasher who mightve just been written horribly and then theres the last act and the big bad    horrible cg and a just an abysmal performance by the big bad who was just completely unforgettable  i get it its an origin story so we need a baddie that mimics the good guy but this was just a who cares villain that seemed to be thrown in because they couldnt figure out how to end this movie    the justice society was cool again dr fate and hawkman very cool dwayne was one note and this movie just bad
Oct 24 2022,positive,about time something good from dc i give it a 9 out of 10 now let see if dc doesnt screw this on up like they done in the past with most of their movies
Oct 24 2022,positive,one of the best sh movies i felt like i was reading the stories the rock was born for this character pierce brosnan was great as mr fate i love quintessa swindell as cyclone
Oct 24 2022,positive,i am really unsure how so many critics did not like this movie i know its not perfect but i thought it was pretty good action is great cgi is great the characters are great villain is decent and story is decent but overall really enjoyed it
Oct 24 2022,positive,great movie cant wait for the sequal
Oct 24 2022,positive,did the characters justice stay for the post credit scene
Oct 24 2022,positive,the kids and adults loved it yay for dc too bad the reviews arent great 
Oct 24 2022,positive,dc is getting it right that ratio tells you everything you need to know i really enjoyed it despite losing all interest in the genre due to the mcu and its neutered frivolous characters cant wait for the next installment
Oct 24 2022,positive,great movie great plot tons of action good mix of darkness and humor one of the better dc movies for sure dwayne fits the role well 
Oct 24 2022,positive,dwayne the rock johnson has solidified his place and role in the cinematic dcu
Oct 24 2022,negative,this was a bit of a disaster im afraid
Oct 24 2022,positive,great film finally dc got it right
Oct 24 2022,positive,great movie that kept my attention
Oct 24 2022,positive,absolutely an amazing movie dc is coming for marvel slowly
Oct 24 2022,positive,perfect movie rock was great again end credit scene will blow your mind
Oct 24 2022,positive,one of the best chatacter adaptations in the dceu
Oct 24 2022,neutral,the conceptpremise was cool but between the overdramatized action sequences the pacing and the dull dialogue the execution just felt messy and didnt quite land still an ok movie
Oct 24 2022,positive,great action movie wich it was meant to be aldis hodge is great too
Oct 24 2022,positive,who listens to critics any more the movie was a fun way to spend 2 hours pierce brosnan is always watchable
Oct 24 2022,positive,so intense good characters and awesome story
Oct 24 2022,positive,the rock gave to the people what they wanted a fun superhero movie with lots of action the movie has a solid cast and cgi but is suffers from its third act and a weak last minute vilain overall we had a good time watching it and the cinema was packed
Oct 24 2022,positive,a lot better than i expected lots of great scenes and lines too the rock did an excellent job and i really liked the back story its awesome to see dr fate too
Oct 24 2022,positive,it was a good dumb time at the movies design and cgi of big bad and his minions were lame and generic battles between adam and jsa were great i enjoyed it overall 
Oct 24 2022,negative,so bad dc comics disappoints again plot is all over the place and full of cheesy one liners 
Oct 24 2022,positive,this movie is so much better than i expected it to be
Oct 24 2022,positive,exceeded all my expectations and was just fantastic
Oct 24 2022,positive,finally a good film that i love beside the marvel woke lately simple story telling and excited to watch love it
Oct 24 2022,positive,one of the best best movies ever i love it great teamwork on the cast and everyone that made the movie possible thank you
Oct 24 2022,positive,way more than i expected the movie manages to balance comedy having also lots of cgi fights that are awesome definetly a must see in cinema all the special efects worths it
Oct 24 2022,positive,loved it good story plenty of humor yet high stakes and sacrifice
Oct 24 2022,positive,dont listen to all these disneymarvel owned critics who will praise anything marvel but hate anything dc this movie isnt winning any oscars but man was it fun to watch the whole theatre was cheering and laughing it was simply a good ride dr fate steals to show in my opinion be your own judge and see this movie
Oct 24 2022,positive,seen breyer superhero movies than this the story centered on saving a mom and her child lack of villain development backstory of the jsa you almost flop like justice league the rocks charisma and the cameo at the end saves this movie 
Oct 24 2022,positive,it was an awesome actionpacked dc movie breathtaking from beginning to end 
Oct 24 2022,positive,although a bit long this movie really recenters the dceu and is great in general my kids loved it and it shows this is a passion project for the rock
Oct 24 2022,positive,at first i thought movie is bad because of rotten tomatoes rating then i watched the movie on friday but the movie is completely differentits fucking goat kindly watch it in theatres dont believe in reviews movie is amazing you will fullfiled with rock performance
Oct 24 2022,positive,it was a really fun watch went in with no expectations and had a great time watching the rock kick ass
Oct 24 2022,positive,the rock was amazing  and the ending of the movie insane great movie
Oct 24 2022,positive,its the best movie of the year i cant believe people said other stuff green should be good and this one not
Oct 24 2022,positive,my kids loved it wifey an i loved it wish there was more violence but i get it pg13 the the rock killed it good to see uli latukefu and bringing in 4 more dc characters  we cant wait to watch their orgin stories blackadam is a beast we cant wait for the next one great job rocky
Oct 24 2022,positive,this movie restored some hope in this genre it was good not great but ill take good
Oct 24 2022,positive,i saw this movie 2 days in a row the critics are idiots this is a wonderful fun and great movie its good natured and has a great story ok the cgi and score could have been better but this film makes up for it in pure entertainment my respect for anything that a socalled movie critic says is at an all time low
Oct 24 2022,positive,not as bad as the rt fun movie
Oct 24 2022,positive,fun movie worth the price of admission and even the price of the popcorn to boot critics continue to show their uselessness and wouldnt know a good movie if it bit them in the rear end
Oct 24 2022,positive,no complaints it was an amazing movie
Oct 24 2022,negative,too much narration  lots of things happened with no motivation or just the writers saying this should happen now because  way too much slow motion  stupid cgi villain with nothing to make you care about him at the end  on the comic geek side too much continuity issues
Oct 24 2022,positive,i really liked it a lot although the villain is lousy
Oct 24 2022,positive,it is exactly what it was suppose to be  a new intro to the dc world with a movie that had much action an easy plot and easy to follow  this was an enjoyable early afternoon movie that i will watch again when it is on video
Oct 24 2022,positive,i just wanted to say you guys rotten tomatoes have lost a lot of credibility just from this movie the fact so many weirdo marvel fans critics can have a opinion that can literally ruin the movies chance is disgusting its quite obvious it deserves far over 70 at least like has anyone actually read the reviews some of these weido verified critics left like how is no one talking about how stupid their reviews are
Oct 24 2022,negative,the story and plot is really bad acting likewise there is so much that dont make sense   the rock is still a terrible actor no surprise there dcs masterplan to catch up to marvel is apparantly to cast old pro wrestlers and see what sticks it will no doubt exite adolecents and manchildren but not many else   the only redeemable qualities here is the postcredit scene and brosnan  not really worth watching at cinemas wait for streaming
Oct 24 2022,positive,solid superheroantihero movie i went with friends and we had a good time then more talking about it after worth the money
Oct 24 2022,positive,this was fun to watch i was expecting a bit more integration with the current dc characters weve seen in the past but i guess it didnt really matter too much as the movie was still good without it  the hawkman character wasnt believeable as the leader as he behaved arrogantly i really didnt beleive he had a wealth of experience fighting  yet he made poor decisions during the movie  it would have been good to see a bit more of the suppression the city was going through  it was hard to take their side when you didnt see any examples of actual suppression or even the leader of the supressing army
Oct 24 2022,positive,the rock is a phenomenal actor its definitely a movie we could watch again another classic to add to the list
Oct 24 2022,positive,great movie all around
Oct 24 2022,positive,great movie entertained from beginning to end much better then last few marvel movies excited for the future of dc movies
Oct 24 2022,positive,this movie was fun and amazing the action scenes were beautiful and the story was good i love the jos and every character in it the movie isnt perfect but its definitely a mustwatch for sure i give it an 810 score
Oct 24 2022,positive,a movie that i and my girlfriend were pleasantly surprised to have enjoyed the plot lines was thin but not bad there wasnt any moments where i felt let down by how weak by the final big boss is there is minimal character development however there are many unexpected humour and has excellent cinematography which made the film overall a very enjoyable movie
Oct 24 2022,positive,do not understand why some are down voting this movie very entertaining hope they release the extended uncut version on hbomax
Oct 24 2022,positive,every hater who doesnt like super hero movies is who the media is listening to  go see this movie  stay for the credit scene  the whole movie is awesome
Oct 24 2022,positive,dc went marvel only better fun movie no doubt about it great supporting cast as well well done
Oct 24 2022,positive,great dc movie finally
Oct 24 2022,positive,i thought it was a very entertaining movie my son and i love the rock and seeing him as a superhero was awesome things i didnt like were them changing the story from the comics but it was fine i wish we could have seen more of dr fate he was super cool and i dont think he should have died but it was fine too
Oct 24 2022,positive,great movie they kept it simple and enjoyable to watch
Oct 24 2022,positive,i really enjoyed the movie i dont understand the specialized critics which is what i expected to see when it comes to a fiction movie
Oct 24 2022,positive,easily one of the best dc movies ever the rock did a great job on this one
Oct 24 2022,positive,lots of action sarcasm and fun rock delivered a darker super hero and it was great
Oct 24 2022,positive,loved it from start to finish awesome movie
Oct 24 2022,positive,this was one of the best comic movies and for it not being a better reflection of an 80 approval is surprising i was entertained and all the actors did great and the rock was phenomenal
Oct 24 2022,positive,this movie is not just an amazing cinematographic work it is a movie that demonstrates that dc is on the right path in the path that marvel has entered with cgi and impeccable performances
Oct 24 2022,positive,i liked the fighting scenes and the post credit scene i dislike the jokes and the plot also wasnt a fan of dr fate dying
Oct 24 2022,positive,good fun movie lots of great action with good characters and the post credit scene was awesome had a blast with this i would recommend this to everyone good step in the right direction for dc
Oct 24 2022,positive,honestly best movie ive seen in a while the rock killed it
Oct 24 2022,positive,great movie dont listen to the critics it was a pretty good movie definitely sets up the new dcu
Oct 24 2022,positive,the movie was awesome see it for yourself dont go by this critics that believe that everything has to be perfect to their eyes is a comic book base movie and we have to be grateful that people have interest on making movies of this characters if not we wont see them on movies at all

Oct 24 2022,positive,really good action and its pretty funny but i wish they changed atom smasher and dr fate in particular to be more distinct from antman and dr strange that way they could have avoided comparisons to the mcu it would have been nice for them to have fleshed the jsa out a bit mor too other than that it was a pretty solid movie and i would recommend it

Oct 24 2022,positive,i actually enjoyed this movie i didnt have super high expectations but overall it was action packed and while some characters couldve been handled better it was a refreshing movie that was trying to do anything more than entertain and setup for more dc movies     also that end credit scene is a must watch if youre a die hard comic fan you may not like it but if you can look past the flaws its actually a very good movie

Oct 24 2022,neutral,so many great elements a potentially great character and charismatic stars in the rock pierce the underrated sarah shahi and some great set pieces but as an overall cinema experience its just a hot messsuch a pity i love the rock but he can do better

Oct 24 2022,positive,pretty good good action
Oct 24 2022,positive,its a dc movie so not great but its shazam adjacent so better than most other dc movies but considering that it stars the rock it bumps the movie quality up an entire star lots of great fight scenes good pacing ending felt off for some reason cant put a finger on why overall a really good antisuperhero movie 
Oct 24 2022,positive,loved this movie not sure why it got negative reviews from the critics it delivered on action some laughs and a great story and we got henry cavill what more could you want from a comic book movie the rock was fantastic in the role   if it was a bit longer it could have explored the back ground of the justice society characters a bit more  thats not a criticism though
Oct 24 2022,positive,i might have to jump ship from marvel to dc to be honest
Oct 24 2022,positive,very entertaining great characters lots of action the kid was a bit annoying is my only con from the movie

Oct 24 2022,positive,it was action packed and funny
Oct 24 2022,positive,really good movie and great addition to the dcu there were only a couple of small things i didnt like about the movie but that was story wise and not the actors fault they probably couldve added 3040 minutes of backstory to help the regular viewers understand where the other heros are coming from
Oct 24 2022,negative,generic action film lots of things happening on screen and not a lot of sense the rock doing an american accent for no reason what so ever considering his characters origin really bugs

Oct 24 2022,positive,the best in superheroes this year thanks dwayne  well i also liked the multiverse of madness and werewolf by night but this one takes the lead in my opinion
Oct 24 2022,positive,not sure what these so called critics drank before they watched this movie i heard the theatre burst into laughter at least 8 or 9 times and almost everyone sat waiting for the post credits thats how you know a movie is that good this is about the 14th movie ive watched where so called critics have said its rotten yet us regular eyes gave it anywhere from 70  95 this is why the worst the critics give it the more i wanna watch it critics are most of the times very wrong
Oct 24 2022,positive,it was ok could have been better written
Oct 24 2022,positive,ill say its on top of best dcu movies not hard title to hold but its earned there were issues the flow of the movie the kids speech towards the end looked like a bad dub they are obviously trying to make atom smasher the tom holland spiderman of dcmu and poorly at that but the story was great adam was spot on and pierce as dr fate was an amazing choice its a toss up who was the coolest fate or adam not a perfect movie but a damn good one in comparison to other dcmu or mcu movies
Oct 24 2022,positive,best superhero movie ive seen this year i love marvel a lot but this movie proves that dc can make some quality work as well if it has the right folks involved hopefully the rock can guide dc to a brighter future  only thing i wish it was better was the development of the villain sabbac but this doesnt make the movie worst now everything else was just magnificent great movie dont know why the critics are trashing the movie i dont believe they watched the same thing i did
Oct 24 2022,positive,the atom smasher character was very weak
Oct 24 2022,positive,amazing we were engaged throughout the entire movie

Oct 23 2022,positive,critics are on something this is a fantastic movie that deserve its respect
Oct 23 2022,positive,really enjoyable hero film my only gripe is that tethadam adapted a little too quickly to modern culture like how he could use sarcasm with just one example and his awkward use of a catchphrase
Oct 23 2022,positive,entertaining movie allows you to get lost in the action  the introduction of more dc characters expand the narrative universe highly recommended for lovers of the genre
Oct 23 2022,positive,pretty good dc movie havent seen nothing like this since man of steel cgi couldve been better but besides that it had good attention to details overall 6510

Oct 23 2022,positive,who doesnt love dc and the rock stay for the bonus credits
Oct 23 2022,positive,if you want to see the action this is the movie simple plot no bullshit and the main thing no stupid jokes every 5 minutes
Oct 23 2022,negative,this movie is not a movie that any christian should ever see the rock should be ashamed that he sold out to hollywood society and the push towards satanic worship we didnt even look at the reviews because the rock always did clean movies this was pure evil and is exactly what hollywood wants we are giving up  our movie passes due to this it needs a negative star not one positive
Oct 23 2022,negative,ok so its based on comics but the story is just stupid  and seemed to steal ideas from other movies  i think its too violent for kids
Oct 23 2022,positive,great movie  great action for a dc movie  it was great  i totally understand the rotten tomatoes score but i totally support this movie  amazing post credit scene  dr fate was cast perfectly  just enough jokes
Oct 23 2022,positive,loved the whole movie
Oct 23 2022,positive,it reminded me of why i stopped watching dc movies too dark and derivative of marvel  and raiders of even the soundtrack if they do a sequel ill watch but they have to do better  better writing is a must
Oct 23 2022,positive,it doesnt have an oscar winning script but it was a very entertaining movie and had lots of great action
Oct 23 2022,positive,the best dc movie in my opinion and love all the action scenes
Oct 23 2022,positive,besides the batman this was the most fun and entertaining superhero movie of the year so far after the massive dissapointments of love and thunder and multiverse of madness it was actually great watching somthing good again great fights and visuals decent story that kept me engaged with some minor cringe moments
Oct 23 2022,positive,much better than expected best dceu movie imo a step towards the right direction
Oct 23 2022,positive,i dont know what movie the critics saw but this movie is what comic book fans needed great movie

Oct 23 2022,positive,just saw this film is amazing isnt boring good movie dc is becoming good finnaly
Oct 23 2022,positive,i do not understand the splat rating the story was great and the character portrayals were perfect pierce kills it as dr fate     stop reading reviews and go see the moving dont forget to watch the end credits
Oct 23 2022,positive,it was good clean entertaining fun i saw it with my 12 year old son and if you like shazam youll enjoy this movie way better than thor lt which i also saw in theaters i liked duane johnsons portrayal of this character it had all the good elements of an enjoyable film i didnt feel preached to i didnt feel lectured i didnt feel annoyed with anything about this movie if there was any social messaging in this movie i didnt catch it and im pretty keen on spotting that type of stuff     i recommend this movie    tony
Oct 23 2022,positive,this movie gave me exactly what i wanted heavy on the action punches and explosions the rocks action scenes are of course amazing and the smirks were right on cue had a bit of a cliche twist on how he got his powers but it really works and johnson does great job in the flashbacks looking forward to seeing more in the future definitely a mustsee in the theaters
Oct 23 2022,positive,enjoyed the action and comedy hated the negative aspects  but i enjoyed it  the rock was made for the role
Oct 23 2022,positive,ever since the success of the first avengers movie filmmakers have been going nuts stuffing movies with supercharacters with the result that most are bland and underdeveloped  there were five supercharacters in this movie and every single one was welldrawn and compelling  you cared about what happened to all of them and enjoyed spending time with them  this is an amazing accomplishment and deserves praise  the movie itself is packed with action sequences and loads of just pure fun start to finish  if dc does more of this it will do wonders for healing a damaged brand  see it twice
Oct 23 2022,positive,idk what these pineapples are talking about but this movie was top tier
Oct 23 2022,positive,the movie has some problems but not anything that cannot easily fixed the characters development took a back seat the action of the movie is great but at the cost of the story the action sequences are very long for no apparent reason
Oct 23 2022,positive,what we were waiting for quite a long time
Oct 23 2022,positive,turning point for the dc universe in cinema it may not of been the instant game changer dc was looking for but be ready for the slow burn of success this film will have on comic book fans

Oct 23 2022,positive,loved every bit of it
Oct 23 2022,positive,loved every bit of it 
Oct 23 2022,positive,lots of action but not enough character building or story explanations it assumes you know all the characters and motivations so it just runs on the action scenes that said the action scenes are good and the actors do their characters justice its definitely aimed at the fans though others may get lost with the storyline 
Oct 23 2022,positive,great action and heart  love the rock and the rest of the cast was good too

Oct 23 2022,positive,excellent hero movie  finally someone learned what we nerds want  its okay to reimagine the heroesvillains the problem is destroying and modifying them  excellent movie some small errors and good special effects not wonderful but very good  i hope they dont lose the thread i leave the cinema happy because i needed a movie about heroes like this for years
Oct 23 2022,positive,a very fun movie with action scenes that excite and manage to live up to the great superhero movies the pace is very good and presents all the characters well leaving a desire to know more about the supporting cast opening a bright future for the dc movies the rock and aldis hodge are big highlights
Oct 23 2022,positive,fun fun fun  ignore the critic reviews go see it  youll have a great time
Oct 23 2022,positive,it was great the fans have truly spoken non stop action great story this was 100 times better than that marvel poop

Oct 23 2022,positive,fantastic movie its about time they followed the comics too many times they make superhero movies and its nothing like the comics this is something rotten tomatoes can not help with i would not imagine they no much about comics thats why they gave it a bad ratting  they said shehulk was better are they kidding me they also said the eternals was better what now you know why i dont listen to them

Oct 23 2022,positive,the best dc movie forget what the critics say great movie
Oct 23 2022,positive,it was a complete action movie  it could have been 20 minutes shorter and i would not have missed anything there was not enough character development aside from the primary character to allow the plot to support the action  it became a guessing game about what special effect and superpower would show up next there wasnt enough there to make it worth waiting
Oct 23 2022,positive,i thought the story was good and the characters as well  but didnt wow me
Oct 23 2022,positive,spectacular this movie was awesome a good break from the bad superhero movies lately

Oct 23 2022,positive,super fun critiques failed us again dc did not pay them as much as disney does
Oct 23 2022,positive,i really wanted this movie to be awesome  thirty minutes into it i almost walked out it was so disappointing  the plot was lazy and utterly predictable  the reliance on cgi instead of talent and plot was upsetting  there were a few funny moments  i just cant recommend going to any trouble to see this
Oct 23 2022,neutral,full of oneliners and average acting  definitely not a must see
Oct 23 2022,positive,we liked the action  and the plot was great we were not disappointed at allwell worth the time

Oct 23 2022,positive,amazing full of action and emotion critics dont know what theyre talking about as usual
Oct 23 2022,positive,this movie was great most of yall must be marvel people rating the movie but the cgi artist was great and the plot

Oct 23 2022,negative,a total messit seemed that they couldnt make up their minds about what they wanted this movie to be
Oct 23 2022,positive,i was pleasantly surprised at how much i liked this movie  its fastpaced which made 2 hours fly which i like and the characters and the cinematography were great  i really liked the costumes especially hawkmans and cyclone looked absolutely ethereal in her element  the beginning sequence was a bit cheesy all of the later fighting sequences were perfect and exactly what i envision when i think of superheroes fighting gods  i was amazed at how they could put this altogether and make it look so stunning  the skater boys dialogue was too much  if they would have cut some of that out the dialogue would have been perfect for me  there were a few really good lol moments and i was super excited to see the cameo during the credits  this is a movie i can watch again
Oct 23 2022,positive,just an awesome movie with all the elements of what marvel universe used to be
Oct 23 2022,positive,the rock can you smell what the rock is cooking hands down the best dc movie every made this movie has me excited for dc now please stay for the end dc is coming for marvel
Oct 23 2022,positive,critics never seem to like what i like anymore so if the pan something i see it  the movie was entertaining and i stayed through the credits to see my boy superman its a great popcorn flick doesnt have to be shakespeare
Oct 23 2022,positive,turn off your brain turn up your imagination grab the popcorn and just sit back for the ride
Oct 23 2022,positive,was very hesitant on going to see this because of all the terrible critic ratings and scores im extremely glad i made the decision to go anyways i thoroughly enjoyed this movie non stop action and an excellent popcorn flick i think sometimes critics expect too much of these kinds of films people do not attend these movies looking for an academy award type of performance or story this is a super fun take your mind off of things type of movie i loved it
Oct 23 2022,positive,it was an awesome movie
Oct 23 2022,positive,phenomenal very outstanding and to see very detailed 
Oct 23 2022,positive,this movie is awsome    action  action  action

Oct 23 2022,positive,everything was awesome
Oct 23 2022,positive,this movie was amazing the cast of characters were really diverse the kid amad played by bodhi sabongui really stole the show i would love to see him play in lots of other movies that kid has a bright future dwayne johnson really surprised me with his role my one problem with his performance is that he seemed so flat for half of the movie isis played by sarah shahi was amazing i would wanna see a movie just about her adventures atom smasher played by noah centineo amazing noah should stick to super hero movies he seemed so natural in that role atom smashers friendship with cyclone was really cute it felt so cute and soft atom smasher and hawkman was really funny speaking of hawkman is performance was phenomenal enough said the problem with cyclone was that we didnt see more of her at first i thought wow is her power just being pretty but the more i watched her i just wished i seen more of her   doctor fate  i love him   the ending was so good   i recommend this movie to dc nerds you may need a little bit of surface level knowledge of the jsa overall good movie
Oct 23 2022,positive,it has everything a superhero movie needs  people who are complaining dont even know what theyre doing in the theater since they signed up for that movie genre
Oct 23 2022,positive,i love the rock he did a really good job being surly and sarcastic
Oct 23 2022,positive,very good finally some real super hero type action
Oct 23 2022,positive,unnecessary punch lines made movie feel a little cheesy
Oct 23 2022,positive,the truth was good its not the big deal but it does entertain in a few words i liked it a lot    ill just say that in the postcredit scene everyone in the room applauded  i also include myself
Oct 23 2022,positive,finally the rock has come back to save superhero movies

Oct 23 2022,positive,honestly a fun movie
Oct 23 2022,positive,definitely entertaining and easy on the eyes
Oct 23 2022,positive,impressed  definitely worth a watch
Oct 23 2022,positive,amazing movie best dc movie yet 
Oct 23 2022,positive,this is the best dc has put out todate  i so enjoyed it cant wait to see the epic battle between the most powerful
Oct 23 2022,positive,awesome from beginning to end
Oct 23 2022,positive,lots of action although the slow mo was a bit overused didnt really like that they tried to get the audience interested in some of the smaller role characters of the jsa i think they could have cut those scenes out entirely and the film would have been exactly the same overall an entertaining film with some issues but we had a good time
Oct 23 2022,positive,lots of action it seems like dc is headed in the right direction with this movie
Oct 23 2022,positive,this movie is fun enough said
Oct 23 2022,positive,i thought it was fun and well done
Oct 23 2022,positive,this movie was action packed with great effects and amazing characters  i dont understand the hate its been getting at all
Oct 23 2022,negative,average movie at best in this genre dwayne johnson was good but storyline was a bit boring and not something id recommend investing in going to theater to see
Oct 23 2022,positive,best superhero movie of the year
Oct 23 2022,positive,not sure what movies these critics watched but they got it 100 wrong this movie is fantastic youll be kicking yourself for not seeing it in theaters
Oct 23 2022,positive,great cast great action great effects and most surprisingly a great plot with a strong theme also the supersuits were great
Oct 23 2022,positive,entertaining and had me at the edge of my seat the whole time
Oct 23 2022,positive,i have always been a fan of the rock and this movie did not disappoint there is so much action and the cinematography is outstanding great actors casted
Oct 23 2022,negative,very bland wait until streaming
Oct 23 2022,positive,the movie did have a bit of a cringy story but it was a great movie to watch  all the oooos and aaaahhhs action was amazing   the jsa was really well done  there was more than enough action and jokes that worked with one liners that fit the situation  the vfx team did an amazing job shout out to them  it wasnt a perfect movie but it was a good time and worth seeing again
Oct 23 2022,positive,literally a great and entertaining film some jokes are corny and unnecessary overall plot is 810 action 910 the justice society is a 7510 the whole crown thing was weird but plot characters and story is great a good dc movie weve had since the batman critics people dont believe in critics audiences give you the real answer
Oct 23 2022,positive,dont read what the professional critics have to say about this movie though there are some parts like any movie that make you think why was that added in there are plenty of fun action scenes and an interesting story dwayne johnson draws similarities to deadpool given they are both antiheroes with their own selfish goals in mind with the added comedy and increased violence from a superhero movie this one makes for a really fun couple of hours
Oct 23 2022,positive,its better than 75 mcu phase 4 and its quite entertaining
Oct 23 2022,positive,fascinating storyline  great character arcs worth seeing in the theaters love the subtle eggs throughout the movie very well done
Oct 23 2022,neutral,def wouldnt watch it again willingly boring nonsensical with incredibly dated action and cgi
Oct 23 2022,positive,just great entertainment dwayne johnson and the whole cast were amazing best dc movie yet even better than the recent marvel movies and shows a must watch in theaters
Oct 23 2022,positive,this movie keeps zack snyders godly epic aestethics whilst it works as a perfect superheroic flick with fastpaced action simple but engaging plot with a twist and great music it is yet another stellar approach to dc universe after the remade version of justice league
Oct 23 2022,positive,it was great im glad that duane johnson wasnt all bad didnt feel like a two hour movie
Oct 23 2022,positive,awesome movie definitely recommend
Oct 23 2022,positive,saw it with the family its a story that been told and has been told again and again the rock is cooking fresh this time as teth adam when he was summoned back when the people of kandaq is at their lowest point being occupied by invaders     its an overall decently made film to enjoy and forget about the pandering of hollywood the action set pieces are a joy to watch and well put together characters is as standard as you would expect with the exception of pierce brosnan as dr fate and a very impressive aldis hodge as hawkman who exceeded my expectation as he carried the mantle very well     atom smasher and cyclone were mostly relegated to the sidelines and provided a vehicle for the audience to both take provide some grounding and comedic relief     i really hope dc continues to make films like this and build upon standalone films instead of trying to catch up to a hero mashup dc needs to do to what they are good at and maybe once the characters have been established well enough they can consider a teamup then
Oct 23 2022,positive,loved all the action story works for what there is
Oct 23 2022,positive,it was pretty good i enjoyed what they did with the characters even though it wasnt true to the comics
Oct 23 2022,positive,its not perfect but very cool for every dc fan aftercredit scene made my day 
Oct 23 2022,positive,it was okay for an origin story
Oct 23 2022,positive,i liked it i think wat made this movie for me was dr fate 
Oct 23 2022,positive,great music and visuals loved the end credit scene
Oct 23 2022,positive,so good the rock was awesome
Oct 23 2022,positive,its a typical 90s superhero movie flashy but boring flat characters with no motivation the titular character which is an antihero in comics here is a typical hero he only kills bad guys armsdealers gang members etc     its a typical movie to run on the cable at 9pm once in a while
Oct 23 2022,negative,this film was a mess from the get go definitely made for the fast and the furious crowd if thats your thing its fine but it was all just loud action no character development or even explanation for some one of the weakest villains ever in a superhero movie some really cheesy scenes the best part was the credits where you finally see a true hero
Oct 23 2022,positive,i loved everything about the movie and theater
Oct 23 2022,positive,this was pleasantly surprising to me and the family as we were expecting a disappointing experience based on early reviews which goes to show that you should experience movies for yourself instead on relying in reviews    the story carried through from beginning to end which was decent and kept you engaged the action and visual effects were well done and the effort was appreciated
Oct 23 2022,negative,makes the justice league look good      very mediocre acting weak plot and b movie special effects     dc comics took a step backwards
Oct 23 2022,positive,i thought it was awesome
Oct 23 2022,positive,best superheroe movie since zack snyders cut well done dwayne johnson i can wait to see the next movie
Oct 23 2022,positive,this movie was a ton of fun
Oct 23 2022,positive,a lot of fun thanks dc  thanks rock   i wish more of dr fate
Oct 23 2022,positive,awesome dont remember when i saw such a good comics movie
Oct 23 2022,positive,this was one of the best movies i have seen all year
Oct 23 2022,positive,exceed my expectation i like teth adam storyline the heroes were phenomenal espicially hawk performance was far too good
Oct 23 2022,positive,wow this is the iron man of dc action at the begin to the end 
Oct 23 2022,positive,a fun family friendly movie the action is amazing and the post credit 
Oct 23 2022,positive,great movie with lots of action
Oct 23 2022,negative,i will never understand how dc keeps making the same mistakes which collectively make all their films suck the story is there how on earth do you guys keep dropping the ball cast better hire better directors better screen writers stop speeding through the plot and trying to fit so much in this movie could have been 2 and with that youd have had us more invested instead of doing too muchi am so annoyed lmao
Oct 23 2022,positive,one of the best superhero movies i have ever seen you will not be disappointed
Oct 23 2022,positive,fun popcorn action movie
Oct 23 2022,positive,very entertaining and a thrilling ride
Oct 23 2022,negative,smh best part was seeing superman  just a bad connection between  super heroes story line was boring another dud from dc
Oct 23 2022,negative,complicated confusing plot  should have been better  the rick did a good job
Oct 23 2022,positive,would have given 5 stars but the 2 young super heros were not up to the level of the others
Oct 23 2022,positive,this movies was a action packed master class on why characters knowing the background performs well fell in love with the rock playing teth adam in this anti hero dc masterclass 1110
Oct 23 2022,positive,the movie was a fun to watch movies with alot of fight characters were amazing its your classic superhero movie
Oct 23 2022,positive,not the deepest movie you ever saw but solid action and the rock and pierce brosnan have charm for days
Oct 23 2022,negative,writing was terrible story was somehow rushed and boring dr fate was nerfed yet another failure by dc
Oct 23 2022,positive,it was everything i hoped for in a dc comicbook movie action story and plot im a simple dude i see a good dc movie i rate it good
Oct 23 2022,positive,this is the best superhero movie since avengers endgame critics are so out of touch with what audiences want watch this movie
Oct 23 2022,positive,exceeded my expectations
Oct 23 2022,positive,i thought that movie was very good it was good  to see a different perspective on a character who was always portrayed as a villain i hope this ignites the dc universe with a new series of of movies
Oct 23 2022,positive,overall i greatly enjoyed the film cinematically it was awesome overall good use of special effects a little overused in certain spots but not enough to complain about the certain spots being the wind powered superhero who for the life of me i cant remember her name her acting and everything else that she had control over was well done but she was a little too spinny in the cgi if youve seen it then you understand the only other thing i didnt like about the film was some of the sound design it may be just me but in certain spots it was really not appropriate music for the emotion they seem to be trying to express surprisingly good heros journey story
Oct 23 2022,positive,this is certainly one of the most movies of all time
Oct 23 2022,positive,very entertaining love the rock loved the movie
Oct 23 2022,positive,the movie was great kept me entertained from beginning to end loved the story it may not win any awards but i was able to follow it im not sure what the critics are looking for but for the average moviegoer this just what you need and it shows what could be a bright future for the dceu  strongly recommend this movie
Oct 23 2022,positive,this is definitely a 910 for me seriously i think most critics dont know what a good movie is
Oct 23 2022,positive,the movie was fun and the critics are just out of touch as usual
Oct 23 2022,positive,i enjoyed it a lot the weak link of the movie is the kid who is unintentionally annoying  pierce brosnan is killing it as doctor fate and i really liked the depiction of carter hol dwayne delivered a classic comic book movie although i would have liked to see sabacc done with makeup instead of cgi this is not a ground breaking movie but its fun and authentic
Oct 23 2022,positive,the big hinging was slow and the movie should have been edited down 30 less minutes
Oct 23 2022,positive,awesome movie with great actions and reflective themes
Oct 23 2022,positive,i loved it great action scenes great special effects it had its funny my moments when it was perfect and it had serious moments when it was perfect as well i enjoyed it so much  very great job guys very great cast
Oct 23 2022,negative,for a big  budget cgi movie magic parts suckscgi fights poorly scriptedslow the action down have better punches or even some wrestling moves  trying to tell to much story in a little time
Oct 23 2022,positive,it was awesome the story needs a little more work but everything else is great
Oct 23 2022,positive,if you love superhero movies with lots of action sequences youll definitely enjoy this  great job dc
Oct 23 2022,positive,very good critics were wrong go watch this movie 
Oct 23 2022,positive,was it a masterpiece of modern cinema filmmaking no but it did exactly what it was suppose to do good action logical beginning middle and end fun characters and great ending thats all i wanted out of it and i got what i wanted
Oct 23 2022,positive,pretty much just a straight forward action movie  didnt have any surprising twists or real drama but overall a good catch it if you can movie but not a must see
Oct 23 2022,positive,i love its politcal statement that people should not dictate the lives of those from other countries the only people who can save themselves from oppression is the residents of the country
Oct 23 2022,positive,go watch it its great

Oct 23 2022,positive,typical marvel movie but with the  rocks muscles  lots of action and death may not be suitable for young children but i did enjoy it
Oct 23 2022,positive,very entertaining  exactly what a superhero movie should be
Oct 23 2022,positive,very good movie  well worth the time  it is action packed and story line was very well laid out  it didnt seem like a 2 hour movie
Oct 23 2022,positive,i loved how the movie lived up to real comic expectations and truly divulged into lots of action scenes using high budget cgi all around enjoyed the flying battles realistic fights and character development all around 1010 movie
Oct 23 2022,negative,boring reapeatable and unsurprising
Oct 23 2022,positive,great first step to bring dceu back just the exact amount of jokes to not fall in despair of making the audience laugh yelling goats  and get something clear dc its dc darker serious and wont follow any other leads pierce brosnan as dr fate is 
Oct 23 2022,positive,best dc movie so far
Oct 23 2022,positive,i have previously only been a marvel fan my sister convinced me to see the movie and now i have to do hours of research watching the rest of the dc movies

Oct 23 2022,positive,maybe recent super hero movies left a bad taste in my mouth looking at you love and thunder but this movie was pretty dang good lots of neat little easter eggs for dc fans and that end credits scene sure left me excited the cgi needs some work though
Oct 23 2022,positive,must see movie dont listen to the critics
Oct 23 2022,positive,love that dc finally understands the formula  action packed and fun to watch  the rock does not disappoint
Oct 23 2022,negative,i dont know the movie was interrupted and did not finished
Oct 23 2022,positive,cool but a lil hollywood with the villain being basic
Oct 23 2022,positive,me and my family just went to see it  awesome movie  everyone love it
Oct 23 2022,positive,passed the time couldnt be sympathetic with the characters and honestly was sad when they didnt die in perilous situations tried to be comedic too early
Oct 23 2022,positive,great action packed movie cgi is a finally a movie at day time that you can enjoy from beginning to end
Oct 23 2022,positive,action packed  fun characters   but of humor
Oct 23 2022,positive,that was dope definitely has a different look  feel 
Oct 23 2022,positive,not the greatest dc movie but very entertaining and fun to watch dont listen to the critics is a superhero movie about a fictional character doesnt have to perfect
Oct 23 2022,positive,great pure superhero movie loved it
Oct 23 2022,positive,fantastic film the rock shined i appreciate the simple story as it avoided unnecessary complications that normally ruin a film it promises a bright future for dceu
Oct 23 2022,positive,i loved the movie the story the actions scenes the cgi were on point however some characters were a bit lazy in writing but it didnt bother me at all because rest of the movie was really good
Oct 23 2022,positive,bottom line  fun entertaining i was glad i got my butt out to the theater to watch this one    is the rock a shakespearian level thespian  was this the greatest movie ever made  no to both  but its nice to see a ripped superhero just like in the comic books and this movie was by far the best superhero movie made since spiderman no way home    its just nice to return to the old days of cinema where you could just go see a great action movie without being preached to and have the studio and actors actually care about the fan base   sidenote  this has some great action sequences and had the grit and darker feel of a snyder film so i think synder fans and dc fans in general would like this  advice to wbs or whoever owns the property in the future  make more quality dc content  not all movies have to be a billion plus blockbusters  get good writers make dc universe with continuity work with the fans and exploit the ip you have  i guarantee youll make a profit have loyal fans and make billions in merchandising
Oct 23 2022,positive,it was very action filles
Oct 23 2022,positive,action packed constant entertainment some characters could have been explained a bit more but videography and music was greatly intense

Oct 23 2022,positive,its a great movie for me make me feel very excited for the action the fights every single second of the movie the rock dr fate the best
Oct 23 2022,positive,best part was seeing superman for five seconds
Oct 23 2022,positive,the film isnt amazing but it definitely is not as bad as the critics make it out to be if you like superhero movies youll enjoy this one the characters are great the special effects as well so id recommend watching this movie
Oct 23 2022,positive,best dc movie to date low bar to clear admittedly the movie is basically action piled on top of action the the bare minimum of character development thought the jsa characters were the most fun and three dimensional with ba missing opportunities for humor as a man out of time     thought the twist on his origin was well done and the integration with the powers that be to be a bit heavy handed but they did have some intel on his rage issues to be fair    all in all would recommend and will see it again at home
Oct 23 2022,positive,watched it at the cinema today i liked the film cool action but the plot is very formulaic however the stereotyped plot is perhaps the only weak point of the film for which i put away one star  everything else is great  everyone praises adam but i also liked so much dr faith and hawk as for faith well hopefully well see more of pierce in the movies but the hawk has become a real find i can not wait for his appearance in new films i think aldis hodge played his character wonderfully he is cool and ambiguous  i expect that after this the dc will begin a new dawn lets just say that this film gave me back the faith that all is not lost for the dc
Oct 23 2022,positive,action packed funny moments and great characters definitely going to be watching this again
Oct 23 2022,positive,a great film an opportunity to enjoy again a good film in the dcu
Oct 23 2022,positive,this is why ive stopped paying attention to critic ratings i hate what they love and love what they hate back in the day before rotten tomatoes existed people just watched what they wanted to and made their own conclusions
Oct 23 2022,positive,what a surprise a fun experience that moves as fast as the charisma on screen   well worth a see
Oct 23 2022,positive,action packed and good for those that enjoy watching movies for entertainment value
Oct 23 2022,positive,this is an outstandingly entertaining film tons of action throughout and very little to no dull moments special effects are awesome and the storyline has a lot going on but thats part of what makes it fun to watch 1010 recommend
Oct 23 2022,positive,talking of whole its an awesome moviemay be one of the best superhero movie i have seen in yearssome points could have been made better like boys voice wasnt motivating at allthere were 2 to 3 scenes where cgi quality dropped but hard work was visible and acting in fight scene with dead army felt over and ruined the creativity of movie
Oct 23 2022,positive,action packed electrifying and super fun i loved it

Oct 23 2022,positive,great family movie  good twist on shazam
Oct 23 2022,negative,felt more like a fanfiction written by the rock to show how badass he is more than a real movie
Oct 23 2022,neutral,it was pretty boring pretty much a completely empty action movie no new territory explored here there is a secret scene  it made me more excited than the whole rest of the movie i feel like im being over generous with the star rating but im a softy
Oct 23 2022,positive,thus was better that expected the end cut scene made it worth it all looking forward to whats next
Oct 23 2022,positive,truly the best film ever the rock was one of the many factors that made this movie amazing i cant wait for the sequel because this movie is stellar at the level of the likes of breaking bad and south parki cant describe how much this film is fantastic an epic debut of the rock in the dc universe
Oct 23 2022,positive,great action movie the jla in full action modethe rock is this generation arnold schwarzenegger
Oct 23 2022,positive,they should have removed some out of place humour but it works sometimes post credit scene cheers and whistles was the most craziest moment in the theatre watched it in my native language for the first time gonna watch it again in english tomorrow its not the best it its good and dont miss the post credit

Oct 23 2022,positive,best super hero movie
Oct 23 2022,positive,really fun and enjoyable movie
Oct 23 2022,neutral,a movie that was years in the making to just be a disappointment shallow story awful villain and reminding us every other piece of dialogue that he isnt a hero     half of the jsa didnt need to be there and the other half made no sense in the world that has the justice league with no explanation where they were in earlier movies a simple scene could have helped
Oct 23 2022,positive,not amazing and a bit predictable but fun on the big screen my experience suffered a little from not knowing the characters they introduced but their introductions were short and they moved on to the story quickly which was a much better strategy than trying to exposition dump the character wiki page like the original suicide squad tried to do definitely brings up the average for dc films
Oct 23 2022,positive,absolutely fantastic movie cinematography was incredible and of course dwyane johnson and pierse brosnan lead strong performances from all
Oct 23 2022,positive,had a lot good action cgi was great the rock did his thing

Oct 23 2022,positive,this was a lot better than i was expecting besides too many slow motion sequences and some of the same plot mechanics weve grown used to in super hero movies this was actually a breath of fresh air much better than the last 2 marvel movies for sure
Oct 23 2022,positive,i enjoyed the movie very much i liked the origin story and was entertained throughout dont know why the low scores
Oct 23 2022,positive,awesome story line made me root for the bad guy and not just the justice league

Oct 23 2022,positive,good action movie for this year it been awhile
Oct 23 2022,positive,great fun and a refreshing break from the justice league the justice society should be the dceu focus from here on for a while build up lesser known characters

Oct 23 2022,positive,one of the best superhero movies ive seen in a long time dc has really upped their game with this one very impressed and fingers crossed for a no2
Oct 23 2022,positive,if you want to see a fun action movie this is the movie for you loads of fun
Oct 23 2022,positive,the movie was great definitely not the best movie ever or even the best superhero movie but definitely one of the best dc movies up to date and it means that dc is finally in the right direction this is one huuuugggeee step in the right direction is it my favourite movie no would i watch it again definitely i think the casting was done perfectly it has a great interconnection with the dceu and it has so much potential for future plotlines involving the characters introduced here dc has finally done the right thing  it listed to its fans it does not spend half of the movie introducing the new character it is action packed with a mix of really interesting storylines definitely a must watch im so excited to see what happens in the dceu after this and if you havnt watched it stick around the credits
Oct 23 2022,positive,its a movie to enjoy in the cinema action action and more action it was a surprise

Oct 23 2022,positive,so overall this was definitely a decent movie and better then the critics give it credit for with that said i also see where they are coming from in a lot of ways the overall script definitely lacked a little the fluff parts of the movie that happened to be there were pretty bad and not in anyway relevant to the story line so that kind of through me off but overall it was enjoyable and a good movie
Oct 23 2022,positive,i love the movie the action and humor was top notch
Oct 23 2022,positive,great fun movie wont win any awards for the story but youll enjoy your time watching it
Oct 23 2022,positive,i wonder where are even the negative ratings coming from
Oct 23 2022,positive,dont listen to the critics the discrepancy between the audience score and the critics score should tell you something they are exposed for all to see   this movie is a throwback to the classic superhero movies of the 90s and early marvel movies you know when they were actually good best superhero movie ive seen since spiderman no way home the audience was clapping at the end at the theatre i was in   action from beginning to end its so good the movie seemed like a hour long not two 9 out of 10 for me
Oct 23 2022,positive,action packed and entertaining
Oct 23 2022,positive,action packed very entertaining
Oct 23 2022,positive,look dj is great at this stuff im sure tkt sales will be high but so many holes in story telling    dc needs to get a handle on those fight scenes i mean cmon they all become one big fx event why they decided on skeleton zombies i mean really the pic is about 15 min too long    why does hawkmans helmet suddenly become one of those appear and disappear things when it is a solid helmet the entire movie and i thought no one could touch dr fates helmet     we dont kill is a line they use all the time in dc movies yet with the amount of destruction in the middle of the city they surely would have killed thousands of people ugh dc cmon    glad we see hc
Oct 23 2022,positive,its not the worst and not the best its just nice to see fresh dc characters getting portrayed on the big screen its a step forward towards something dont know what that something is but something is better than nothing
Oct 23 2022,positive,entertaining good action but a fair story line one of the rocks better movie

Oct 23 2022,positive,very good movie hace action kills story the only missing point was the bad guy
Oct 23 2022,positive,this is the movie ive been waiting to see on the big screen for a long time it was an adrenaline fuelled visual feast it was engaging beginning to end   the action special effects and choreography blows anything of recent out of the blocks    only criticism is that the villain is a bit generic but the rest of the movie compensates for that pierce brosnan as dr fate is a standout throughout the movie would love to see more of him   and oh incase you havent heard that mid credits scene gives you goosebumps great things ahead
Oct 23 2022,positive,lots of action great new characters loved hawkman and dr fate i hope we get more of them end credit scene was exciting cant wait to see whats next for dc

Oct 23 2022,positive,loved it very entertaining from beginning to end needed at better background story for the villain but otherwise great
Oct 23 2022,positive,the movie was in your face action although pretty formulaic a little predictable and heavy on the slomo shots the movie is alot of fun the movie has some dark moments but over all it doesnt take itself too seriously which is a good change for a dc movie the supporting characters really shine throughout i do question the pg13 rating because of the level of violence and the language use but those same action sequences and special effects is what we paid to see and you get your moneys worth on this outing this is worth a watch and a level above the recent marvel releases spidermanno way home excluded
Oct 23 2022,positive,for what it was the movie was honestly pretty good i went in expecting a popcorn action superhero flick and got exactly that action was good and the story was a bit messy but it definitely wasnt bad most solid 710 i could ever give a movie

Oct 23 2022,negative,when we went to see this i didnt check it out too much and didnt realize it was another dc movie ive got to stop seeing those they do not make good movies and this was no exception the movie seemed disjointed lack of good story telling some of the scenes were lame while they had great special effects and fighting scenes those scenes just werent usually tied in well with the story while i was watching it i thought some of the major actors that were in the movie should be embarrassed to be a part of it
Oct 23 2022,positive,best cbm in 2022 so far still so much better than some overhyped marvel movies fun and breath taking action rock rocks
Oct 23 2022,positive,wow  absolutely awesome  love this man the rock hierarchy of power changed also had a big cameo at the end he did what he said also loved dr fate  i enjoyed it a lot i am watching it again ill watch it again and again with my different friend groups
Oct 23 2022,positive,delivered exactly what i hoped it would it was fun the effects were cool the story wasnt too convoluted and the rock did not play the rock for once hawkman and dr fate are the standouts of the film its a great popcorn movie and youll have a blast
Oct 23 2022,positive,a total blast dont know exactly whats the starting point for critics to place bad reviews on this movie for us as an audience it was amazing finally we are being heard the rock totally fits in a superhero skin
Oct 23 2022,positive,i loved it there wasnt anything new but there has been so many superhero movies before this one very entertaining
Oct 23 2022,positive,i honestly enjoyed the movie a lot its not oscar worthy or anything its not even trying to be its just a heartful superhero flick that entertains you through out after watching this movie i decided not to trust critics anymore
Oct 23 2022,positive,shouldnt really work and theres a bit to much intro but honestly i had a blast and went out smiling the rock jsa theyre were all good the rock especially ill definitely come see the next as well

Oct 23 2022,positive,has amazing action and the surprise cameo is amazingjob well done dc
Oct 23 2022,positive,excellent movie definitely this movie enters the list of best movies about comic book heroes  congratulations dwayne johnson
Oct 23 2022,positive,great movie full comic action in real life the rock is terrific in his interpretation recomended
Oct 23 2022,positive,as far as superhero films go it is better than what marvel have put out recently it is high on action which is good but it moves alone at a fast pace which leaves no time for character development
Oct 23 2022,positive,good movie with awesome fight scenes and not at all boring from beginning to the end one of the best dc films i have seen in a while and all the cast and team nailed it 100 percent worth the watch
Oct 23 2022,positive,although the movie should be about a vilan the way they introduced him like anti hero was something amazing and  jsa was so impressive too  we need to consider about there are some mistakes in the movie many things could be better  but i really enjoyed it
Oct 23 2022,positive,what an amazing movieit is as enjoyable as no way home and as cool and good as the batman critics were paid to rate this movie low go watch it
Oct 23 2022,positive,this is a very straight foward super hero movie lots of action and a simple plot to it  its is fun sit down and enjoy the ride type movie     the movie is just under the 2h mark even after waiting for the mid credit scene so it take only about 15min after the opening pro log to get the action started the movie is fast paced which is fine to me becuse not every movie needs to be two and half three hours long     it does have its faults with some of the plot and the kid charcter gets a scene near the end where i felt it was a unnecessary      the rock has the look down and it is enjoyable to watch him kill bad guys with no remorse and some brutal one where even the punisher would be like  nice one     its gets half a star plus for the end credit scene in the hope of whats to come from it
Oct 23 2022,positive,another one the critics got wrong a fun enjoyable ride
Oct 23 2022,positive,i like it when theres comedic lines in a movie like this
Oct 23 2022,positive,johnson excellent brosnan charismatic hodge strong personality and emotion great humour apart from some cringey support cast acting  but hey thats the family element and emotional elements to the story     action and effects spot on but too much slow mo in cetain places start was slow but the pay off came with later reveals any critic saying this is 40 ie worse than bang average clearly doesnt like fun or action
Oct 23 2022,positive,my friends and i had a great time honestly this was such a fun film to watch definitely want to see it again sometime with some more friends too 
Oct 23 2022,positive,the rock delivered the whole cast was amazing i cant wait to include this in my collection thank you for listening to the fans and staying true to that conviction we appreciate you

Oct 23 2022,positive,one very simple history but enjoyable
Oct 23 2022,positive,i like the action scenes and twist in the story line i dislike that the 2 young members of team were pretty much useless
Oct 23 2022,positive,full packed action and a great post credit schene  critics hate it because it tell a true story about a certain nation who mess around other countries to export democracy only when there are  involved  this movie is an origin movie way way better then some movie like captain marvel moerbious or venom good cgi some irony and a lot of action
Oct 23 2022,positive,to hell with the critics if you like action and a story line that makes sense go with it this is refreshing to see and make sure to stay for the credits

Oct 23 2022,positive,the rise of dc universe has begun
Oct 23 2022,positive,ignore the rotten ratingsthis movie is the real deal
Oct 23 2022,positive,mindless but exactly what you want from a superhero movie dwayne johnson knows what the people want and duly delivers a great example of a movie which is not meant for the opinionated mass of critics who are judging this film on its oscar credentials with all the negativity already in the world do we really need to hear from people employed to rate movies based on their own bias and who have never looked at a superhero movie without their upturned nose blocking half the screen get a real job lads
Oct 23 2022,positive,best dc movie love it from start to the end  i hate when they make anti hero movies and they make them seem good and not trying to kill where this is what we want from the anti heros they do it they way kill as they like 9 out of 10 from me

Oct 23 2022,positive,this is going to win an oscar but its not meant to its meant to bring fictitious characters to life in an entertaining way and dwayne johnson and the cast did just that in true rock fashion this comic book movie was electrifyingly fun dc doesnt need to compete like nintendo they need to focus on what they want to do and keep that momentum going

Oct 23 2022,positive,loved it better than the majority of the dceu movies while others tell a story at the beginning and end up with action this one starts with action and ends with action while filling you in with some backstory critics say that it failed at being dark but it was just enough for all ages to enjoy there were much more the critics have said that i dont agree i dont think they get the point of the movie the audience all agree this was a great movie who cares about these clueless critics

Oct 23 2022,positive,entertaining but not genre breaking   will front in and say im not a dc expert by any means so maybe nuances of the story were missed but it felt a bit basic screenplay wise but great action and never felt bored could watch dj all day
Oct 23 2022,positive,i enjoyed the movie there are some character building issues and some acting that i didnt think were so good but thats not a big issue for the overall context of this movie the action scenes are simply amazing and i had a lot of fun watching it

Oct 23 2022,positive,is a great movie a of the best of dc
Oct 23 2022,negative,dc still is trying to find hes way in to the big screen had high hopes for this one to bad
Oct 23 2022,positive,i wanted this movie to blow me away i wanted to see a storyline that made sense and wasnt too confusing being that 4 new super heros were being introduced but that didnt happen dwayne really didnt have or need apparently a wide range of acting ability to start in this movie his character was pretty much the same throughout i felt henrys appearance in a few seconds showed what an accomplished actor can do atom smasher was meant to be naive and cute but it didnt work hes useless and cyclone wasnt that impressive dr fate couldve had something but it was too much with too little time to develop the character was it actionpacked full of awesome cgi yes was it corny yes did you lose believability during the movie yes  theres a reason why dc continues to fall behind marvel and this is just another example why
Oct 23 2022,negative,we all expected an mcu film from the rock but this product is somehow worse
Oct 23 2022,positive,we enjoy the movie action from the beginning to the end great work dc  cant wait for part two
Oct 23 2022,positive,the movie was great from beginning to the end dont know why rt is rating it poorly shows how down rt has falling and its disgusting  guys only trust google users score for movies now  cause this guys aint it anymore
Oct 23 2022,positive,this movie rocks 
Oct 23 2022,positive,fun watch with my son
Oct 23 2022,positive,do yourself a favor and go see this movie trust me there is reason why audiences love it  is action packed and the special effects are awesome this is in my opinion one of dcs better movies outside of the batmans solo flicks dont listen to this so call criticis who are in some other studios packets this movie is much much better than anyone expected
Oct 23 2022,positive,the movie has small defects but in general its a great movie
Oct 23 2022,positive,best dc movie ive seen in a while and probably i best superhero movie ive seen since spider man 3 really enjoyed every minute of it and i really hope dc keeps this up
Oct 23 2022,positive,a little cringy here and there but absolutely gives what fans want entertainment
Oct 23 2022,positive,good movie great entertainment with the right amount of humour
Oct 23 2022,positive,honestly a good time dc fans will appreciate the effort my cinema 3040 people had a lot of consistent laughs and even some applause at the end this films script isnt as tight as other superhero films but i think its super enjoyable the rock doesnt just play the rock which was my worry going into this his character is firm in his beliefs and solid to the core its an icy antihero juxtaposed by a happy go lucky squad of heroes who want to stop him ultimately if you enjoyed aquaman or shazam  chances are youll have a good time
Oct 23 2022,positive,the movie was so fire rock was killing it tbh visuals were stunning all of the characters had their own personalities humor wasnt cringe and acting was good   costumes were amazing def one of if not the best dc movie ever made
Oct 23 2022,positive,a very well constructed mix of action organic comedy compelling characters and a shot at connectedness in the dceu
Oct 23 2022,positive,great movie dc did a great job on this one
Oct 23 2022,positive,critics aint shtttt go watch the movie its fun
Oct 23 2022,positive,awesome movie the rock was incredible  could be something i wold change as the telling storie but i love the rock and was  more than wonder finally see him as super hero
Oct 23 2022,positive,way better than expected i saw those rotten tomatoes reviews and didnt have much hope the movie is good not great but really good hopefully dc is headed in the right direction
Oct 23 2022,positive,critics dont know what theyre saying
Oct 23 2022,positive,what a ride  great story great fxfantastic addition the dc franchise and mr johnson himself campaigning for what the fans wantits about time someone took the bull bu the horns and gave this universe what it deserves bring on superman
Oct 23 2022,negative,i went in with no expectations which usually means i can enjoy whatever but i couldnt connect with this at all the script was terrible some good ideas but they never went anywhere i somehow didnt care about anyone the music was odd and didnt help the emotion of the scenes and the song use felt very off the cgi was sometimes bad even in the same shot with good cgi which was jarring hawkman was unnecessarily an ahole the entire time doctor fate was the best part probably and so of course the other 2 were given nothing in the middle of some fight scene possibly the bedroom one which was goofy as hell i literally thought how can i be bored with this much stuff happening  apparently i really dont like the whole speed rampslo motion thing or at least when 90 of the action is that the rock was the rock no stretching there that i saw most of the kid stuff didnt work the entire final act was unnecessary and bad sadly i could go on the only thing that made sense was the backstory reveal which explained why his character kinda sucked even though he sorta came around the theater i was in was silent until the post credit which it was cool to see him but also did nothing     i think a lot of people are being really generous in their reviews here because everyone wants this to be a win there are way too many 4 star reviews where the review lists everything they thought was wrong with it
Oct 23 2022,negative,horrible movie  dont waste your time
Oct 23 2022,positive,great characters amazing action and special effects storyline is ok 
Oct 23 2022,positive,this movie was great
Oct 23 2022,positive,dc at its best a weak villian but there is rock on the opposite sidewhat more to say
Oct 23 2022,positive,good movie not a dc fan  good potential for superman v adam
Oct 23 2022,positive,the rock chegou para fazer história na dc
Oct 23 2022,positive,excellent  fun action movie  see the negatives and it appears people are expecting too much from a comic book based type movie when i read comic books i was not expecting the same thing as books i read in english class these are generally just fun fantasy diversions can they be more sure but they dont have to be this was fun and the clip at the end was a god hook for a future movie
Oct 23 2022,positive,i love the movie this is the by far best superhero movie ever in 2022
Oct 23 2022,positive,great action and world building justice society was really good i enjoyed the movie a lot beginning wasnt the best for me but after that it really started going

Oct 23 2022,positive,the action and pace is superb overall an excellent movie with great action sequence visuals are top notch and as usually rock rocked it in other words rotten tomatoes you can sck it
Oct 23 2022,positive,critics are being dumb dc knocked it out of the park did great with the source material and johnson plays it well without being too cheesy or brooding sure there are a couple of moments that arent perfect but find me a film that has every single moment perfect the supporting hero cast know their places and it works well honestly very refreshing as a dc fan to see this adaptation dont believe the critics of you like superhero movies this is a solid entry

Oct 23 2022,positive,loved it well done
Oct 23 2022,positive,really missed these type of movies alot of action and pierce brosnan was a great choice for doctor fate 
Oct 23 2022,positive,this is why you cant trust critics over audience i went to see this film yesterday and its every bit of the opposite critics claimed to be its fun full of action cool sarcastic jokes cgi was to standard quite similar to recent marvel movies overall dc films are heading in the right direction lately and thats great as comic book movie fans this simply means more variety marvels movies are fun and all but also getting good dc movies means there will be even more to enjoy as more films come out from it with different type of stories to show in the big screen im trying not to give away any spoilers for people that havent seen the movie yet     what i can say is if youre a neutral comic book movies fan who loves both marvel and dc as i do and understand the difference between both comic books type of storytelling with dc being a bit more on the darker and serious side but overall enjoyable youre in for a ride with this one make sure to stick to the mid credit scene
Oct 23 2022,positive,characters plot special effects the rock all was beautiful
Oct 23 2022,negative,overpromised and underdelivered sums up the movie perfectly
Oct 23 2022,negative,the rock and his ego completely spoiled the movie
Oct 23 2022,positive,i try to avoid the critics here at rotten tomatoes like the plague but came here to prove a point if you believed the critics rating youd miss out on alot of great movieslike this one reading thru a ton of these reviews just shows how off kilter or bias the critis here are ill say this regular movie goers this was a really good movie i personally liked it alot dont take my word or anyone elses tho go see for yourself and to the rotten tomatoes critics if this is your day jobquit now hang it up youre either bad at this or get paid to tank movies or give bad reviews either way you suck
Oct 23 2022,positive,so much better than i thought it would be lots of actions great characters and an overall awesome movie yes some parts of the story were odd but the cast really made those parts seem not so important it was great seeing hawkman and dr fate finally brought to the big screen and cyclone and adam smasher were so well done

Oct 23 2022,positive,great film i look forward to the future of dc bring back snyderman
Oct 23 2022,negative,over hyped mindless action movie generic acting and really bad script didnt jell well together special effects are good but they should be when you spend over 200 million making a movie even the actions sequences were retreads from other movies and brought absolutely nothing new to the table michael bay has a happy tear in his eyes right now as big flashes loud explosions and over dramatic shots are everywhere
Oct 23 2022,positive,i think the critics are biased and corrupt kudos to dwayne the rock johnson the movie was awesome great cgi cant wait for the next one
Oct 23 2022,positive,action packed great acting kids and i all enjoyed the movie
Oct 23 2022,positive,brilliant movie open up so many more opertunities for dc and dwayne johnson was a massive part great to see an old friend back too   
Oct 23 2022,positive,i really thought that it wouldnt be good low expectations but it blew me away even though it has some weird moments the movie is action packed and johnsons acting is better than i expected his performance on his origin story is on spot the action is old school great very powerful and decent fighting sequences and the musical score was very good and heroic hawkmans actor impressed me very recommended if you want real entertainment this is the kind of movie that people really want
Oct 23 2022,positive,it was fun like watching an old justice league cartoon as a kid fun    could it have benefited from a more streamlined story yes    should they have dived a bit deeper into the darkness with the character totally especially because if were supposed to believe that he has the potential for bad down the road i didnt get that sense after the credits roll    did i roll my eyes at some of the dialogue hawkman has 0 nuance yep    but did i have fun absolutely tons of action lots of interesting ideas and a group of heros i want to explore further     let the critics use their thesauruses to pan this movie and make themselves feel smart you go spend your 15 dollars buy a big popcorn be a kid and have a fun night out     also mad that the rock stole the excitement from the end credits scene away from me

Oct 23 2022,positive,non stop action never was a dull moment my kind of movie that kept the audience entertained
Oct 23 2022,positive,well thought through casting all characters played well into the storyline and the character arc of adam was succinct enough to fit into 1 movie

Oct 23 2022,positive,this movie left me wanting for more jsa action exactly what you would expect from a fun action packed comic book movie loved doctor fate
Oct 23 2022,positive,vfx is amazing critics dont know what they are talking about
Oct 23 2022,positive,great movie beautifully done perfect balance  of comedy drama and action i was entertained from beginning to end
Oct 23 2022,positive,average dc movie give it a watch but doesnt compare to other big dc movies such as ww joker batman etc
Oct 23 2022,positive,this film is great for its action and twists and turns in the story that are not expected by someone who has not read the comic books although i say this i would have preferred this film go more in depth with the theme of morals between saving and killing criminals as the film stops utilizing this theme halfway through the film
Oct 23 2022,positive,awesome movie definitely worth the wait would honestly watch again in the cinemas great work from the rock and everyone else i volves i dont know what the critics are on about but the audience score says a lot
Oct 23 2022,positive,i cant imagine another way to introduce this character better than this movie did  it does worth waiting 15 years to finally see the dcs strongest anti hero
Oct 23 2022,positive,i gave it 3 stars because normally i like the rocs stuff but this particular movie was over run with special effects with a weak story line and character development
Oct 23 2022,positive,very good fast pacing

Oct 23 2022,negative,very boring movie a massive waste of time
Oct 23 2022,positive,even better the second time
Oct 23 2022,positive,very entertaining thats basically all well i loved the rock as black adam and pierce brosnan as dr fate too but the story the script were nothing original was a thing already seen a thousand times the villain was too forgetable good vfx although the action was good it was too much i missed some relax moments to make the story advance there was too much action and in the moment of going foward w the story they were to fast and that made this movie souless and non interesting any way at least the action was cool and entertaining  i want to see more black adam soon and superman
Oct 23 2022,positive,likely the best dc movie put out the rock performed better than expected unlike most of his other movies i was able to better recognize the character than himself
Oct 23 2022,positive,best dc movie i dont care what the critics think it is a must see hawkman and dr fate were great dwayne johnson was also great and badass
Oct 23 2022,positive,very good movie really good worth every penny for the ticket good movie average story impeccable cgi insane fights and the rock showed us a great job
Oct 23 2022,positive,this was a really fun movie going back to what it makes superhero movies fun a compelling story with a main character you can relate to i really enjoyed the fact that at the end  you realize that this story was more about a man with flaws that decides to be better
Oct 23 2022,positive,hey rock and team  i am giving this rating because i think the rock can change some things at dc i think he actually wants to learn and become a better producer and i think he challenges himself  enough to grow  loved you in the film loved the casting the writing is bad seriously it was not good dont put a false loss in for the hero use a real one and grow from it  it saps the momentum out    good casting  writing  very very child like at moments
Oct 23 2022,positive,why are the professional critics so stupid and detached from what the public wants  the public want to be entertained   its that simple    an autopsy of the movie is not necessary   money talks   the procritics can take a hike or buy a book  they are a waste of time
Oct 23 2022,positive,if you are looking for a nice and tasty burger thats for you highly enjoyable  but if you need a superheroshakespearesirloin must keep the snyder stuff
Oct 23 2022,positive,the movie is amazing
Oct 23 2022,positive,love the rock and this was a none stop thrill ride right till the end
Oct 23 2022,positive,great movie must see  exicted for future advantures  now 
Oct 23 2022,positive,great movie from the beginning to the end full of action a must for the rock fans
Oct 23 2022,negative,wasted potential  story 2 out of 10 what was that ending and that build up  cgi from hell yeah to absolutely cringey  and the bloody droning monotone one track soundtrack  it is a movie of moments few and far apart and maybe you can enjoy it if you turn you brain off couldnt do it though
Oct 23 2022,positive,an family action movie as it shoul be no secret messages clasic values funny to see the opposition from a sector
Oct 23 2022,positive,excellent action packed superhero film the rock is well the rock and pierce brosnan is amazing better than the smug snore fest coming out form marvel at the minute
Oct 23 2022,positive,love the cgi great costume design the definition of not holding back
Oct 23 2022,positive,i didnt like the main kid and mom protagonist so cliche and cringe cant believe the killed off doctor fate  waste of a character one of the best dc characters imo and first movie hes in and its his last  and the mom just didnt care about her son   stay behind me ill protect u  runs away by himself into army of undead   eveyrthing else was great about the film so many actions scenes loved it   the rock actually changed role no just his copy and paste either  710 overall
Oct 23 2022,positive,it was such a great movie
Oct 23 2022,positive,a great step in the right direction for dc
Oct 23 2022,positive,really good to see long time antihero from dc in big screen
Oct 23 2022,positive,theres a good movie here somewhere
Oct 23 2022,negative,damn dc cant write dialogues or edit movies even if their life depends on it
Oct 23 2022,negative,really cheesy poor story line action for action sake bad acting nothing interesting particularly happens film is too long
Oct 23 2022,positive,enjoyed it definitely a good watch for comic or superhero fans with no silliness or cringy play like mcu movies of lately
Oct 23 2022,positive,this was really good  we only even went to see this because my nephews want to and it was surprisingly good  i expected a lesser movie but this worth seeing  casing was good acting was good and the story is kinda fun
Oct 23 2022,positive,the story was meh and i expexted more from dr fate but it was still solid and i loved the post credits scene looking forward to the future of the dceu
Oct 23 2022,positive,great watch and very funny
Oct 23 2022,positive,this is probably the most wellrounded movie dc has ever put out it was a fun ride for sure 4dx really helped this movie shine
Oct 23 2022,positive,the movie was actionpacked from start to feeling finish story is a great start to expand the dceu enjoyed it a lot
Oct 23 2022,positive,it is an antihero character that is very brutal both the storyline that is so darn good that the story takes about 2 hours and 4 minutes that are very full and full but there may be some confusing stories  the next part is the action scenes  rock fun fun and brutal is considered very good fun until sitting next to the chair at all  the use of the camera angle of the movie is the bad point of this movie it is very dizzy  the new characters in the movie are super cool each with their own charms that help make the movie more dimensional  but overall this movie is very good it is recommended to see it in the theater only  the endcredit scene is both shocking and supersurprising and my favorite movie character is doctor fate both smart and very cool
Oct 23 2022,positive,definitely worth the price of admission the movies pacing was outstanding never felt slow or dragging without paying off with a great action scene or two the rock said he put his mind body and soul into this character and i believe him also pierce brosnan as doctor fate was a great choice
Oct 23 2022,positive,this movie was made for fans no more tired formula of explaining the origins of each other character jumps straight into the action the rock delivers
Oct 23 2022,positive,with dwayne johnson ensuring the fans that hes listening by flexing his muscle with that clutch post credit scene i have full confidence in the future of the dceu the movie has its flaws but the bones in which it builds upon are massive in scale to show whats to come and to be expected out of wbd moving forward it is a beacon of hope for not only dc fans but to storytelling structure to movie going willing to see how this franchise will stack up in the long run 5 stars for listening to your audience and showing your care
Oct 23 2022,positive,this is what i expect from a superhero movie
Oct 23 2022,positive,do not pay attention to these critics  most kc them are marvel fans
Oct 23 2022,positive,action is top notch  story is weak but better than marvel phase 4 movies
Oct 23 2022,positive,ive been waiting a long time for this
Oct 23 2022,positive,think rottentomato critics are full of rubbish and probably should get glasses story line was good and easy to follow  really enjoyed it looking forward to the next one
Oct 23 2022,positive,such a fantastic film personally i think all of the action sequences were most certainly out of this world and certainly some of the best i have ever seen dwayne johnson i have got to say really delivered on his part only criticism i have is that it really sucks we wont be seeing pierce brosnan as dr fate again very solid casting by the way
Oct 23 2022,positive,great movie very entertaining and good story
Oct 23 2022,positive,this is a good movie you cant bet against the rock right now

Oct 23 2022,negative,watchable passes time but absolutely no substance
Oct 23 2022,positive,its a great cbm that is packed with great action scenes and visuals story feels a little bit rushed but still is strong enough watch out for the post credit scene 
Oct 23 2022,positive,still awesome till postcredits come
Oct 23 2022,positive,surprised how much i loved this movie nice change to recent superhero movies i mainly watch these types of movies for the action and this movie delivers i dont watch fast and furious movies because of their ridiculousness but with superheroes with superpowers it makes sense whole family loved it from my 5 year old son to my 60 year old mother

Oct 23 2022,positive,this movie is full of action  i love it

Oct 23 2022,positive,this movie was a lot better than i expected
Oct 23 2022,positive,its a great movie for ppl that love action but it has some flaws as well such as the plot the characters background storys and the villain but ovr its a very fun movie to watch with your friends

Oct 23 2022,positive,it was a nice change of pace there were some surprises which kept it fresh some comedic moments were dry but there wasnt too much shoehorned in there were many new characters and many were quite endearing despite so many characters it still felt balanced loved it

Oct 23 2022,positive,you wont get bored watching this actionpacked movie with a welldosed humor only small regrets the stories of the secondary characters are not sufficiently introduced and the abuse of slow motion makes the film heavy when it is supposed to give an impression of speed and power of the heroes

Oct 23 2022,positive,great nonstop action it was never boring and the plot advanced sensibly makes me hopeful for the fate of dc movies
Oct 23 2022,positive,6510 not the best movie out there but its good i had low expectations since ive been seeing reviews saying  its horrible it surprised me what made it good was the action scenes the story was kind of blah but if youre a fan of the rock and like action youll like this one
Oct 23 2022,positive,best movie of the year period
Oct 23 2022,positive,nice return to form for the superhero genre and it feels more self contained like older marvel movies like iron man 1 which is refreshing in a post endgame world and i really hope this is the direction dc takes going forward

Oct 23 2022,positive,refreshing to see after awful marvel films this year dc keep smashing it with solo films and this didnt disappoint for me awesome

Oct 23 2022,positive,longer than it needed to be
Oct 23 2022,positive,no spoilers honestly amazing for what dc brings to the table lately this is a step up now they have a somewhat functional cinematic universe to play with the story itself was fantastically put together i truly didnt know what was going to happen from scene to scene for the most part i hope this leads to a cinematic universe that can rival the mcu
Oct 23 2022,positive,bombastic  brutal enjoyed it more than i thought i would
Oct 23 2022,positive,awesome film that shows how outoftouch marvel films have become
Oct 23 2022,positive,loved it after a long time a superhero movie that i dont regret watching

Oct 23 2022,positive,this is a really fun movie for all the family setting up the next great super hero to join the dc universe the rock pierce brosnan and rest of the cast deliver an action packed thrilling ride 
Oct 23 2022,positive,best cgi i think i have ever seen competes with avatar or any marvel movie i have seen  explains the 200 mil budget  rock was actually pretty bad ass
Oct 23 2022,positive,had an absolute blast watching this movie  amazing action  though the story is straight  forward but it will keep you entertained through great visuals  action and humor  definitely worth a watch
Oct 23 2022,positive,nice movie like it very much
Oct 23 2022,positive,game changer for dc comics without a doubt
Oct 23 2022,positive,i dont know whats with the low rotten tomato score must be biased marvel fan critiques this movie is brilliant best dc movie imho
Oct 23 2022,positive,this movie can be described in one word and that its fun its not a master piece but it is a hell lot of fun
Oct 23 2022,positive,great characters and graphics
Oct 23 2022,positive,its a good movie thank you dc and rock for fan service    my personal favorite drfate some gameing move use 
Oct 23 2022,positive,gas cauee fortnite dude was in it
Oct 23 2022,positive,the most enjoyable dc film ive seen yet i loved the rock as an actor when i was a kid and respected his niche when i grew out of enjoying his roles this was wonderful to see
Oct 23 2022,negative,stupid effects stupid dialog above all boring and cheesy walked out probably a half hour after i should have
Oct 23 2022,negative,so freaking satanic literally had a pentagram on the ending villains chest and witchcraft throughout you could feel the darkness in it
Oct 23 2022,negative,after so much hype this was a letdown the storyline was convoluted with many holes  it plodded along to the point where i almost fell asleep twice  almost the entire movie was predictable and cliche which made the pace that much more excruciating  this is the most mculike movie that the dceu has made  i felt like i was watching bits and pieces of marvel films the entire time with a mixture of ragnarok apocalypse multiverse of madness infinity war gotg vol1 and a few more  i did enjoy the battle scenes as the effects were great possibly the best battle scenes in the dceu so far  the most exciting part is the postcredit scene and what it is setting up next  now thats something im looking forward to
Oct 23 2022,positive,action was amazing  couldnt get enough of it
Oct 23 2022,positive,wow great action movie  1010
Oct 23 2022,positive,sure critically speaking the movie might have been 510 since it could be viewed as a mediocre high production action flick however these days this is incredibly rare and sometimes you just want simple entertainment and in this regard the movie delivers full thrust and it has no real competition
Oct 23 2022,positive,best action and nice background music
Oct 23 2022,positive,the movie is awesome must watch  rotten tomatoes have received alot of tomatoes under the table i guess

Oct 23 2022,positive,best dceu movie very entertaining and it has good characters and chemistry couldnt ask for much more
Oct 23 2022,positive,it was great lot of action and a lot of over the top moments
Oct 23 2022,positive,this movie is great just ignore what the critics are saying
Oct 23 2022,positive,i dont know what the critics are smoking this is 100 pure fun superhero movie sure it may not be the next godfather but it never wants to be a damn good time dc finally seems to know what theyre doing
Oct 23 2022,positive,ignore the critics id say why the critics trashed it but then ill be accused of being certain types of phobic or something ending with ist and starting with an m  lets just say if you loved top gun you will love this movie also
Oct 23 2022,positive,lots of action with comedic anecdotes will definitely be coming back to see it again
Oct 23 2022,positive,was a ton of fun script couldve used work and was definitely tropey but i had a blast
Oct 23 2022,positive,it is a great movie it shows how the superheroes of the usa look upon the other countries and cant help everyone which is what you see in so many dc and marvel movies and you hate the superheroes which is a good change at the beginning of the movie till a compromise is made     if you want to see what struggle the world would be in if superheroes were actually in it this is a good movie to see
Oct 23 2022,positive,best dc movie suck it critics
Oct 23 2022,positive,great movie  action and story were spot on setting up the dcu with a great launching pad for future movies  well done to the cast and crew
Oct 23 2022,positive,the definition of a fun popcorn movie entertaining from beginning to end and something different in the superhero genre a great watch on the big screen
Oct 23 2022,positive,i loved it it was a great movie i will love to watch it again
Oct 23 2022,positive,characters felt fresh great action and entertaining 
Oct 23 2022,positive,just having fun this his what superhero movie should be and this make dc cinematic universe looks visible
Oct 23 2022,positive,liked the whole movie from start to finish
Oct 23 2022,positive,great movie you gotta wait for the credits 
Oct 23 2022,positive,there maybe a couple of cringe moment in the movie but over all it was fun definitely worth the watch dr fate and hawkman were the stand outs for me
Oct 23 2022,positive,action packed amazing
Oct 23 2022,positive,very entertaining the film had great pacing it gave us a brief backstory of the title character and then we were taken on a fastpaced visually vibrant epic action ride that did a great job of introducing viewers to dcs most powerful antihero and one iteration of one of dcs greatest superhero teams the jsa
Oct 23 2022,positive,loved the story line a sequel is a must
Oct 23 2022,positive,great way to introduce many new dc characters movie was awesome and entertaining
Oct 23 2022,positive,one of the best dc movies yet
Oct 23 2022,positive,if you are a rock fan then youll enjoy this movie it has a lot of action in it personally i love the direction that they decided with this movie and hope to see more
Oct 23 2022,positive,i was skeptical about this movie due to the initial critic ratings on various review sights  i must say that this was a great movie and it checks all the boxes for a fun time  no disrespect to the critics but it should say something when the viewer reviews are in total contrast to the critics  my suggestion to the critics is to tap back into what made you fall in love with watching movies  remember the fun factor and stop being over analytical   most of us feel in love with watching movies at a very young age  if a movie is able to draw on those experiences for me and i see the joy on my kids faces then job well done
Oct 23 2022,positive,really fun flick had a great time with my friends
Oct 23 2022,positive,great movie loved it
Oct 23 2022,positive,actuon packed and great story line
Oct 23 2022,positive,incredible backstory telling with and exciting and action filled plot that brings heroes and antihero to work together for a greater good dc has really outdone themselves and the rock was the perfect fit for the role
Oct 23 2022,positive,all around decent popcorn flick doesnt do much wrong hits all the right notes only thing i could say is that i wish tethadam wasnt made to be an antihero instead of a villain
Oct 23 2022,positive,its a really entertaining movie for those who criticize the excess of action i dont know what they expected from a superhero movie it could have ended differently but the ending is good and the incorporation of henry cavill made me superman interesting for the future of dc
Oct 23 2022,positive,a fresh movie for the fans
Oct 23 2022,positive,great action  great visuals  humor was on point  only bad thing for me was that they just threw in the justice society and didnt give us a chance to really get invested into those characters other than that great movie i need more dr fate
Oct 23 2022,positive,yes not the best superhero movie but certainly very entertaining hell cavill is back    better than thor love n thunder
Oct 23 2022,positive,your review will help others decide whether to watch
Oct 23 2022,positive,great story and action packed feels like a very marvel way of story telling but the cast kills it the post credits gives me hope of a continuation of the dceu for dc fans its a must watch
Oct 23 2022,positive,action packed flick which stayed true to the character  lots of potential going forward  ignore the critics and make your own decision on the film  a few corny moments which stopped it from getting the full 5 stars but still well worth the price of admission
Oct 23 2022,positive,loved the superman cameo at the endthat was awesome
Oct 23 2022,positive,eh kind of what you expect with dc  the rock supposedly this is the kickoff of the dcu  feels like a failure in that regard a god popcorn flick but falls flat in regard to establishing a foundation for a cohesive universe
Oct 23 2022,positive,one of the best superhero movies to date
Oct 23 2022,positive,just a fun time where the cgi looks amazing for once in one of these comic book movies amazing action

Oct 23 2022,positive,great dc movie good casting and a lot of action the rock is really making the difference in the dc eu keep up the good work   judging by the rotten tomatoes score and their score to other dc movies i would say these people have a serious grudge against superhero movies too bad

Oct 23 2022,positive,great movie definitely action packed
Oct 23 2022,positive,everybody teaches how to write a screenplay for a hero here blackadam is an antihero the rules are different and the makers tried unconventional screenplay prioritizing action     dont say joker coz its not the same everybody knows that joker 2019 is a soft joker than dark knight     besides who wants to go to a movie where the rock folds his hands and utters principles
Oct 23 2022,positive,really enjoyed this film

Oct 23 2022,positive,its like watching my favorite shonen anime
Oct 23 2022,positive,wow what a difference from that s that marvel is doing in the last movies and series thor she hulk the fights and the feeling of the power of the characters are awesome the rock is great at everything  and he was able to transmit a sense of evilness and purpose at the same time cant wait to see what is coming next
Oct 23 2022,positive,superhero movie fans will not be disappointed
Oct 23 2022,positive,genuinely a top tier comic book origin story

Oct 23 2022,positive,i watched and dc found yourself finally keep this way the casual public loved this new face of hero movies
Oct 23 2022,positive,what can i say lots of action entertaining enough with a pretty simple pllt linethe rock plays the part well  the special effects were just more of the same as any other super hero type movie not sorry i paid the 800 i think it is far better on the big screen than it would be on a tv

Oct 23 2022,positive,very entertaining fast moving better than expected
Oct 23 2022,positive,very good movie full of action and symbolism worth seeing
Oct 23 2022,positive,really good 1st act decent 2nd act 3rd act could have been greatly improved without the or a better zombie army filler for all the non super beings to deal with overall really good
Oct 23 2022,positive,it is an action packed movie excellent vfx work no nonsense jokes or useless conversations the hype that rock created for this movie is worth it jsa was excellent specially dr fate many people will claim that dr fate is copy of dr strange but sadly dr fate appeared first in comics and dr strange is inspired by him   the critics who hated the movie are mostly used to with nonsense comedy marvel movies such as thor love and thunder she hulk etc
Oct 23 2022,positive,the movie was perfect but the fact of they had random kids running and screaming around taking calls in the theater wasnt ok i know security was trying to remove them but there should be a limit to who can come in alone but honestly the movie was great
Oct 23 2022,positive,the rock promissed and delivered great action scenes and cgi the kind of movie dceu was missing cant wait for more
Oct 23 2022,positive,great movie was written well new characters were great graphics and visuals are top notch and as a non dc fan i wasnt going in expecting much but i came out impressed and would recommend
Oct 23 2022,negative,awful no story line bunch of people thrown in and fighting lots of action but on fast forward the people who gave positives must have been paid to do so there was no emotion in this movie when one of the heroes die i didnt care 
Oct 23 2022,positive,great movie kept me entertained
Oct 23 2022,positive,great special effects easy to follow story line at faster than speed of sound comedic but not silly the rock rocked it my 12 year old great grandson loved pierce brosnans character and said theyll be sorry they killed him off
Oct 23 2022,positive,thankfully it kept true to the character and limited the comedy which kept the tone consistent
Oct 23 2022,positive,good action bad dialog acting  except for brosnan 
Oct 23 2022,positive,i dont know what the critics were saying but this movie is great the villain wasnt even bad good action good acting 1010

Oct 23 2022,positive,great action and story line i think graphics will age badly but the movie as it is today is phenomenal
Oct 23 2022,positive,theres a little exposition and the cgi with skinny dewayne is a little off but over all i will say this movie is better than anything marvel has worked on lately aside from spider man but thats mainly sony give it a watch
Oct 23 2022,positive,story left something to be desired but action was great and it was a great introduction to smaller heroes that people may not be super familiar with
Oct 23 2022,positive,best movie dc has made to date

Oct 23 2022,positive,if you dont watch this movie you havent lived
Oct 23 2022,negative,i left the theater after an hour  dc just doesnt do good stories   all of these odd characters came out of nowhere are many are straight ripoffs of marvel characters  dont bother it was a total waste of money
Oct 23 2022,positive,movie was a great time there are a few issues with story and final boss but its a comic book movie he has to fight a cgi characterjust like every comic book movie i was mad his main enemy wasnt in the film but this sets up a new world for dc for more stories to come great job i loved it will see it again

Oct 23 2022,positive,maybe dcs best movie
Oct 23 2022,positive,dj therock did a great job a super hero that finally seems human
Oct 23 2022,positive,great movie critics should retire from ever reviewing a movie because theyre old and out dated let the audience decide where as the critics should focus on a new career path

Oct 23 2022,positive,at first i didnt know how the rock would play a very serious role but my worries were proved wrong as soon as his character made an entrance he played his role better than anyone else could have he did the antivillain justice and the movie as a whole was amazing part two is going to be legendary if they keep this up

Oct 23 2022,positive,very very good  wouldnt mind seeing it again tmrw only thing i feel could have been done a little bit better is the back story on the justice society wish they went a little deeper into how they became the way they are and where they from etc still a really good movie great job by rock as usual watch for cool post credit scene halfway thru credits rolling only one but its a good one
Oct 23 2022,positive,the movie is perfect for a backstory and a fresh start of a new character the story keeps on getting and getting cool and the twist at the climactic part is absolutely perfect the visual effects is cool the fight sequences is just chefs kiss and the most memorable was the end credit scene which made my day ater watching the whole film
Oct 23 2022,positive,thank god i dont listen to these so called critics they lost touch with what certain movies are meant to be   this was just a fun action superhero movie   nothing else personally think marvel gone to far with with trying to make movie to complex   dc keep to this style and you will start getting the fans back
Oct 23 2022,positive,its generic a lazy script and objective movie  but is perfect for the actual moment it reminds the mceus golden era every good movie for the first two fases except winter soldier were exactly like that  the movie is just good action and fun and nothing more and its great i missed that kind  besides alternate great and poor cgi and the main character had a good role
Oct 23 2022,positive,if you are looking for a popcorn superhero action movie this is the one to see the special effects were awesome the cast of heroes were awesome and the fun factor was awesome dwayne johnson stole the show everytime he was on the screen you will also not be dissapointed with the post credit scene

Oct 23 2022,positive,it is so refreshing to see a superhero movie that is action packed with epic fight scenes and a well paced plot it was the perfect balance of humour action and serious moments we have done the dark and broody superman over at least 3 different movies so it was nice to see the good old fashioned version with a curl on his forehead and a helpful grin it was nice to see the rock not over acting or his character over written he is enough and was able to shine best we have seen in a long while they nailed it

Oct 23 2022,positive,i left the cinema satisfied its not a film with great reflections and implied texts but it shouldnt be
Oct 23 2022,positive,this movie was fun with lots of action and some good comedic moments thrown in
Oct 23 2022,positive,movie was a good take on the character it ha last a great balance of seriousness and comedy loved the other characters especially hawk man and fate wouldve love to see them flesh out atom smasher and cyclone more but it did what it needed to do definitely looking forward to what the movie sets up later
Oct 23 2022,positive,the action was good plot was straight forward they did a good job of introducing multiple characters without it feeling bogged down which can be difficult i wouldve preferred less of the little boy and done away with the local towns people getting involved that was too campy for my taste overall it was an enjoyable popcorn flick
Oct 23 2022,positive,a highly entertaining movie yes it could have been a better movie but it is not as bad as the critics say it is as usual the critics got it wrong becasue it seem they want every supehrhero movie from dc to be the dark knight and thats not the case with every character some comic book movies like the comics themselves need to a knock down action feast and this is one for the money    and the rock was a lot better than i thought he would be you can tell he put his all in this movie  i was thinking hed walk through it and let the action and sfx be the defining act in the movie but you actaully feel for him and what he does in the twist in how he gets his powers was a nice touch to add the jsa in it hopefully they can get a movie son    and the closing mid credit scene set something that could be epic in every sense a great time at the movie
Oct 23 2022,positive,great movie what might confuse people is not knowing the backstory of hawkman and dr fate
Oct 23 2022,positive,i liked the movie it was a new take on dc films

Oct 23 2022,positive,i loved the movie the only thing i hated was amon every scene in where he appeared was so cringey and bad
Oct 23 2022,positive,this movie showed me that you shouldnt be convinced by specialized critics the movie is very good and entertaining the rock is a great actor and director and its made for the fans
Oct 23 2022,negative,this movie feels completely out of place in the dceu yet tries so hard to fit itself into it everything in the movie unoriginal and you can see the whole script coming from a mile away the action scenes are great and the actors are really good too and the rock comes through but it still doesnt save the movie the sfx are very well done and help make the mediocre writing more believable    unfortunately this seems like another thoughtless creation to come out of the emmerich hamada johns camp i really hope the new management learns from their mistakes this movie had amazing potential and phenomenal talent too bad they couldnt get a better script
Oct 23 2022,positive,wouldnt call it a great movie but it most definitely is a really good movie
Oct 23 2022,positive,action from beginning to end definitely worth it
Oct 23 2022,positive,very enjoyable movie a lot of action good actor
Oct 23 2022,positive,one of the best superhero movies ever made dont mind about the critics ratings she hulk with 1 episode gave 87  and kept the note until the end the audiences rating will always be the most important and see how the public is enjoying it go to the cinema and watch it more than once if possible simply epic

Oct 23 2022,positive,loved it  one of the best dc movies
Oct 23 2022,positive,whyd they introduce to a super strong character doctor fate and kill him off in the same movie 
Oct 23 2022,positive,the rock is the newest super hero   dc comics shows a different side of movies  and their roster is just as deep as marvel nonstop action from start to beginning its worth a theater experience
Oct 23 2022,positive,its good  the critics are just trippin
Oct 23 2022,positive,i will be honest the movie does have some minor issues but overall still a fantastic movie this is dwayne johnson fulfilling a promise 15 years ago to play black adam this is also for fans of just feel good superhero movies  i really wanna go watch this movie for a second time

Oct 23 2022,negative,the beginning lacked details what powers does the crown give its wearer why was it so easy to find who is the intragang and what do they want the middle of the movie was fun and had some nice action it would have been nice to learn more about the justice society the ending went over the top as a feel good blustery hollywood contrivance that was only lacking a round of kumbaya all in all it was fun but it could have been so much more
Oct 23 2022,positive,it was entertaining and a little boring at the same time
Oct 23 2022,positive,the best 2022 cbm so far

Oct 23 2022,positive,the story was contrived and all over the place but the over the top action in your face humor and one surprisingly effective twist make it entertaining from start to finish
Oct 23 2022,positive,it was a little too slow not very good storyline until the end

Oct 23 2022,negative,lets start with the good the cgi people found a lightly used atari jaguar and created the final bad guy graphics  they also found the last radio shack tandy in existence and used its amazing ai to create the script win win    wow badlikeif you gave a 14 year old a 100 million dollars and said make a movie bad  actually that probably wouldve turned out better because the 14 year old would hire mr beast      heres your plot synopsis  they cast james bond as a brit who wears multiple layers of clothes and performs magic tricks that make food disappear from forgettable characters that are ant man and dead pool merged for costumes with none of their personalitiestalent      seriously howard the duck may be better than this movie  thats never been said as far as i know
Oct 23 2022,positive,this is one of the best superhero movies ever made  it was fun it was funny it didnt follow a formula  it like the first guardians took itself as seriously as superhero movies should characters were relatable and fun to watch  dont buy all the bad press  normal people love this

Oct 23 2022,positive,good acting action and ultimately a decent story but i felt it was in search of a plot and was sorta just happening to itself rather than a discernible thread running through it
Oct 23 2022,positive,the fight scenes were really cool
Oct 23 2022,positive,loved it great action a few corny lines but overall fabulous
Oct 23 2022,positive,way too much going on and hardly any character development

Oct 23 2022,positive,i think it was a great movie not just a superhero movie but a movie that questions what good and evil is and what are our motives i love how it doesnt end when you think this is the ending but continues on and surprises you and stay for the very very end after the texts because another surprise awaits you  definitely a movie worth watching and i even shed a tear a couple of times which rarely happens to me in that universe of super heroes

Oct 23 2022,positive,the movie is really good its a typical superhero movie but is pretty good to pass the time it has a lot of action the cgi is amazing the villian sucksyeah the plot is not that good but characters like hawkman or drfate are stunning especially hawkman  i see they say mos of the time he is getting kicked on the ass the man is literally a man with wings and a maze and even with that he give a fight to adam wich is pretty strong and even a demon the movie is totally overhated and deserve a oportunitty i really recommend it to go with friends or your family you will pass at least a good time

Oct 23 2022,neutral,marvel copycat yet cant copy it well enough
Oct 23 2022,positive,810rotten tomatoes doesnt have a clue about what audiences enjoy the only thing wrong with the movie was dry dialogue at times and a weak villian other than that its a good movie
Oct 23 2022,positive,dwayne johnson and pierce brosnon are the standouts in this film both put in great performances and i look forward to seeing more of them in the future the action is very good in the film and the pacing is quick which i like its very entertaining and for me i left the cinema feeling like id got my value for money its not a film that will make massive waves nor change lives but it will keep you entertained for a few hours and for me thats enough

Oct 23 2022,positive,very good movie nice twist will watch again soon
Oct 23 2022,positive,i will give this 8 out of 10 since not boring and enjoyable with little bit of humour better than the recent mcu tv shows and movies but not upto the level of before 2010 marvel movies and nortons batman trilogy cant even compare bit comparatively to mcu nowadays this is a solid 8
Oct 23 2022,positive,lol f the critics this movie was great electrifying  a fun action movie from start finish
Oct 23 2022,positive,this is definitely the best offering from a dc movie  maybe the best comic book movie ever  the characters were handled with respect  the relationships felt real  the actors performances were top notch  great directing it is very difficult to take concepts from the comic book and put it on the screen  the costumes and effects were a part of the story while building on my knowledge from years of comic book reading  i can critique many things and much of what the critics are saying is bang on but everything comes together very well  they say art is a work that evokes an emotion  the stories in this movie evoked emotions in me  more please

Oct 23 2022,positive,its a really good action movie in my opinion could have a little less parts with forces jokes but i really like it  if you dont like heroes movies dont watch
Oct 23 2022,positive,be far the best dc movie yet and absolutely changes the course of dc  dj kills it and with cavil back as sm the follow up will be big  marvel  better get it together and let go of the meta 4th wall breaking teeny bopper tv shows and bring back the boom like this movie brings  its serious and dark with a dash of humor here and there instead of a comedy which marvel leans on now  loved it
Oct 23 2022,negative,2 hrs of torture dont waste your time or money
Oct 23 2022,positive,fun time non stop actionfunnystay for the end credits

Oct 23 2022,positive,good action visual and sound effects  lives up to dc hero status
Oct 23 2022,positive,it worries me greatly that so many critics are able to give this movie such a bad review  it makes me feel suspicious of the authenticity of their opinion  this is hands down one of the best dc films in a long time
Oct 23 2022,positive,great action side characters were ok definitely seeing again soon
Oct 23 2022,positive,the movie is great the cgi of the movie is very beautiful the fights are epic and the villain was very well built the negative points of the movie are the acting and the lack of construction of some characters  like the cyclone and the atom smash  910
Oct 23 2022,positive,great nonstop oldschool action movie just like the audience likes it

Oct 22 2022,negative,movie is a mess the story gets cut short by all of the different things happening cant really feel like i got to know or care for any of the characters the way they use music in the scenes is awful unidimensional villains soldiers and main bad guy alike and by the way the kid in the movie is so annoying
Oct 22 2022,positive,going in with the expectation of seeing the rock being the rock i was surprised by the supporting plots and characters certainly the most cohesive movie from dc amanda waller showing up talking down to pseudobatman carter hall and the appearance of hammerheroes adam smasher and cyclone was ok seemed more like a photoshoot for both as the others did the work even though its wrote by numbers it still had surprises that pushes it up even for those knowing most of the history really liked it and do stay until the credits

Oct 22 2022,positive,the movie was fantastic lost half a star for dlist heroes filling out the jsa roster and some bad acting on part of the younger actor  fantastic battles good writing and outstanding work by the production team  be sure to stick around for the post credit scene

Oct 22 2022,positive,loved this movie if youre a fan of comicbook movies this was a comicbook come to life i read a critic review that lamented that the movie was pretty much nothing but actionand i couldnt agree more but no one phoned in their roles and while the rock and james bond were notable exceptions aldis hodge was a great hawkman totally believed him cant wait to see that character again loved quintessa as cyclone and noah as atom smasher brought the comic laughter because you gotta have one of these types will definitely rewatch in the theatre a second time maybe the only negative was the third act as many movies and certainly comicbook movies go it was a bit formulaic it felt a lot like the end of the first suicide squad and to a certain degree maybe even like the 2nd suicide squad by gunn standard comic trope and im not sure how thats overcome
Oct 22 2022,positive,i loved this movie the ending was quite good
Oct 22 2022,negative,maybe im sick of superhero movies maybe this was a giant cgi filled snooze fest

Oct 22 2022,positive,watch midcredits scene
Oct 22 2022,positive,the movie was as expected and yes sometimes a little bad is needed to save the world cast chemistry and comedy were as natural and on point the credit scene topped it off now to see where they go from here
Oct 22 2022,positive,its not the best dc movie but its action its entertainment its good cgi its a beginning of something great
Oct 22 2022,positive,personally i enjoyed the movie i thought it was slow paced a bit but the fighting scenes made up for it

Oct 22 2022,positive,great mix of story and comedy
Oct 22 2022,positive,awesome movie me and my son will be seeing this again and again until it starts streaming on line ive always loved the rock though wasnt a big wrestling fan solid actor he really is dont think hes been in a single movie that i didnt love really tried to dislike mysterious island i truly did staunch jules verne fan and thought theyd defile his depiction of the nautilus they didnt got me really hoping for a third movie no such luck lack luster box office numbers im afraid a shame
Oct 22 2022,positive,i was enjoying the movie more than i expected from the initial review of the moview my expectation of it was very low but after i was watching it myself i was suprise that  i love it i love the jsa everything involving jsa was superb especially dr fate the action is nonstop dwayne as balck adam is surpisingly likable there is humor in this movie and most of it are well place and are unexpected however the movie are facing a little bit problem with the pacing additionally the amon kid characters was not really do it for me but apart from that i thought it was a really enjoyable movie recommended
Oct 22 2022,positive,costume design pretty goodalmost like the movies telling 2 different stories more fighting between the heroes then the villain a lot of unnecessary killing storyline almost close to the scorpion king plot

Oct 22 2022,positive,truly an action movie
Oct 22 2022,positive,liked everything about it
Oct 22 2022,negative,i reluctantly went to this film for 2 reasons its dc  d johnson is best in comedy or ff franchise no one cares about the justice society no one cared about this mother  boy therefore this was really all about johnson unfortunately he didnt have a strong acting ensemble to to hide the fact that he is not diverse as an actor same facial expressions same limited emotions and same tired fighting scenes   to dc comics youve had your time your legends christian bale heath ledger joaquin phoenix  margot robbie  the only good film youve put out the franchise you should stick with lego batman
Oct 22 2022,positive,thrilling exciting and intense
Oct 22 2022,positive,best movie of the year well exceruterd action the timing is excellent and the storyline is well played out this movie lets the hero be a heroloved it
Oct 22 2022,positive,this movie was the super hero version of terminator 2 and it was amazing message to the critics if you dont like action movies dont critic them only complaint was the build to the climax could have been shortened but i was very impressed dc is back marvel take notes
Oct 22 2022,positive,the movie is the best way to answered the question of who is the hero and defined the characteristics of the hero although some jokes were not in place and the villain was not on the next level but it makes it easy for you to see real quality in the rest of the shots the attack of critics and analysts is surprisingly strange but we have seen it before with the last of us part 2 i think the world no longer cares about their opinion and awards because it is the audience that embodies the real reality
Oct 22 2022,positive,im a marvel movie guy and i liked the movie a lot great job dwayne rock
Oct 22 2022,positive,this movie is awesome but the only thing i didnt like is the movie is super dark like a bootleg copy i payed 31 for a bootleg version

Oct 22 2022,positive,if youre looking for an oscar type flick this is not it but if youre a fan of comics and action then look no further
Oct 22 2022,positive,this is exactly what dc needed very entertaining competition between dc and marvel will only make these movies better for the fans we already saw what the lack of it will do ie phase 4 snore
Oct 22 2022,positive,it was a great movie with lots of action and the story stayed consistent and not jumping all over the place  id definitely recommend seeing it
Oct 22 2022,positive,different then the rest for sure good movie
Oct 22 2022,positive,i dont see why the qualified critics hate this film sure it isnt the best movie ever made but it was an interesting movie that entertained me well for a couple of hours 710
Oct 22 2022,positive,the movie was great action packed and full of surprises however it was not worth the imax price i feel standard showing would have delivered the same experience for half the price i dont usually do imax but thought this would be a good time to try it i was wrong and will stick to the regular theater from now on as the seats are more comfortable in the standard theater with reclining seats
Oct 22 2022,positive,this movie is the best dc movie yet  thank you rock for bringing henry cavil back

Oct 22 2022,positive,well done kept attention every minute
Oct 22 2022,positive,well done the rock rocks a ton of great action not a marvel movie but it was the best dc movie ive seen since dark night rises or man of steel
Oct 22 2022,positive,action in this new dc movie is fantastic you can feel the fighting impact like you feel in man of steel however like bvs dc again put to many characters in a single movie making the plot and the characterization chaos overall its a good popcorn movie but your excitement will disappear after a single watch
Oct 22 2022,positive,it wasnt amazing but it wasnt bad either its a solid film pretty entertaining despite some problems
Oct 22 2022,positive,dwayne johnson delivered pierce brosnan nailed it as dr fate and the rest of the cast did an amazing job as well i look forward to seeing all these characters again in the future
Oct 22 2022,positive,forget what the critics say theyre wrong about most movies this isnt the shawshank of dc but its a damn good movie thats entertaining and a good direction for dc definitely enjoyed it with the family and the audience score is pretty important than what the senseless critics think
Oct 22 2022,positive,it is a good movie i do not understand critics is not a movie such as the batman or the joker but it has an style similar to avengers and zack snyder justice league its entertaining pure

Oct 22 2022,positive,i took my little brothers to see this movie and i believe without a doubt because of their reaction it is the best superhero movie they have seen so far i recommend that you be the critic and there is nothing better than seeing it through your eyes and your being the critic number 1
Oct 22 2022,positive,while watching the movie it gave me so many nostalgic moments that made me love dc comics it was something i was looking for in a movie and it definitely gave me a good time

Oct 22 2022,positive,definitely the best super hero film in a looonnngg time great cast great acting amazing cgi decent story well paced had humor when needed but not too much and a cameo at the end that will make any dc fan go insane with excitement and happiness 1010  too bad the rotten tomato critics are marvel fan boys and didnt even give it a watch before giving it a stinking review the audience reviews are more accurate go watch and enjoy

Oct 22 2022,positive,this movie was entertaining i got worried about the slow motion at the beginning but that cleared up quick the charactershave their clear motivations and they made sense the action and fights were well captured the comedy came at the right times and it made you laugh or chuckle didnt even notice the time so things were not drawn out for not reason this was my impression from seeing this the first time i need to see it again to catch some of the easter egg enjoy

Oct 22 2022,positive,an action movie that achieves its goal to entertain it has a very good cgi it introduces characters that we clearly want to know more about and the surprise is the rock it doesnt feel like the rock from another movie here the character has a character a personality aldis hodge does a great role as hawkman and well pierce brosnan is god we need to know more about dr fate i dont give it 5 stars because i felt that the final villain lacked character building but as a movie i recommend it

Oct 22 2022,positive,one of the greatest dc films ever made
Oct 22 2022,positive,dc studios must sense a weakness in the recent marvel output and are pumping out their own screen productmilking the  shazam  storyline gives the rock another chance at a superhero role he does a good job within  a mish mash of a plot everyone in the persian esque country speaks perfect non accented english apart from the renata thugs from intergang who seem to be graduates of the henchman inc casting agency  the arrival of the justice society reminded me of  team america world police and whilst going out of their way not to kill anyone no matter how heinous their crime they manage to make many citizens homeless   excellent effects and boom boom bang bang scenes it sets out several other spin offs and sequels  please just sort out the storylines

Oct 22 2022,positive,i honestly dont understand the bad reviews it was a good time with friends and we all agreed it was a solid film we were worried because of some of the negative reviews prior to watching but it was honestly a good entry into the dceu i feel like i definitely enjoyed it more than lets say thor 4
Oct 22 2022,positive,critics suck i thought this was a very good movie  dwayne johnson has effectively saved dc

Oct 22 2022,positive,  fun movie  i enjoyed it and i want to see it again  henry cavill cameo got me in the theater but i enjoyed the movie  great job the rock
Oct 22 2022,positive,this is a lot better than many of the critics are claiming though many of the minor criticisms are deserved     johnson is convincing as adam as a big fan of his jsa and 52 stuff i was surprised how accurately they portrayed his abilities  right down to being nearly as fast as the flash the supporting cast of heroes have a kind of instant chemistry with one another and are all likeable    some odd musical selections at times visually however its awesome probably in the three of dceu films in regards to both practical and special effects    not all of the actors turned in quality jobs but this is a good popcorn superhero film it doesnt delve too deep into geopolitics though it toys with the topic its dark but not grimdark or edgy     so as the rating suggests its good id recommend it
Oct 22 2022,positive,truly enjoyable film was pleasantly surprised only thing i didnt like was the abundance of slowmos
Oct 22 2022,positive,great movie the rock smashed it i am big fan of everything shazam and i was very happy with the movie the so called critics are far from needed anymore the audience matters

Oct 22 2022,neutral,the movie was okay at best it gathered elements from other superheroadventure movies a combination of tomb raider doctor strange zack snyder they changed his comic book origin and nerf out doctor fates powers also a typical dj movie lots of focus on his face but overall i was entertained was it one of the best superhero movie nope but it was entertaining

Oct 22 2022,positive,dwayne johnson did a excellent excellent excellent job on bringing this character to life what was amazing about the whole movie was the strong storyline although i wasnt too crazy about some of the characters in the justice society but the wayne johnson held the film quite steadily with his strong acting smooth special effects

Oct 22 2022,positive,great action scenes looks like dc has really stepped that department up however theres like no character development or connection characters need a little more dialogue
Oct 22 2022,positive,fun action packed violent film absolutely loved it
Oct 22 2022,negative,it was not so great it was definitely missing something definitely too much information given at the start that just made me lose interest quickly i nearly fell asleep
Oct 22 2022,positive,mehstudios should just stay out of the way of writers play to your fan base should have made it r and kept it dark cgi at the end was lame
Oct 22 2022,positive,so i have the benefit of knowing who the jsa characters are and not being as concerned about their backstories ill start there with that being said i did enjoy this film and i can see myself buying it when it becomes available it was refreshing to see a different branch of the dc universe represented while also pretty cool to see them link this project to other corners of the dc film universe its not a perfect picture it could have taken a little bit more time to let some of the plot breathe but on the whole i feel pretty satisfied with not just this movie but what it could symbolize about the future of dc universe films not a bad restart at all if this is really the beginning of phase one like the rock says it is
Oct 22 2022,positive,hella fun and great action loved dr fate

Oct 22 2022,positive,it was a fun film overall but i cannot forgive their treatment of dr fate
Oct 22 2022,positive,the movie was very good funny in the right times and serious in the right times the cgi was a little weird in certain points but its the rock hes the best
Oct 22 2022,positive,dope movie  cant wait to see how dc ties all the movies in together
Oct 22 2022,positive,good story good action
Oct 22 2022,positive,action packed awesomeness
Oct 22 2022,positive,omg this movie was so good from the cast to the action the emotional moments i really enjoyed this movie and will be buying it when it hits digital
Oct 22 2022,positive,this is a much more thoughtful movie than either the avid proponents or detractors seem to indicate in other reviews  this shows some considered maturity from the writers and the rock  i am surprised something this good came out of todays vapid cinema enterprise
Oct 22 2022,positive,this movie was so good like the tomato reviews had me a little worried but i did the right thing by seeing for myself the message the effects go see this movie
Oct 22 2022,positive,best action comic book movie of 2022
Oct 22 2022,positive,i liked it the start was a bit slow but as soon as the rock turned up the movie picked up the rocks character made a lot more sense when you watch the movie than when you see him in the trailer
Oct 22 2022,positive,definitely one of the best dc movies to date keeping it unique with unforgiving dark and very entertaining action
Oct 22 2022,positive,a slow starter but as good if not better than the rest once it gets going a perfect reignition of the dc films and a welcome break from the now repetitive and oversaturated world of marvel the rock impresses and doesnt fall into his normal trandmark gimmicks and pierce brosnon is more than a welcome addition the treatment of hawkman lends for a decent transfer from the comic books similar to what recent films have done for aquaman solid cast if an occasionally cheesy script
Oct 22 2022,positive,intro felt a bit long rest of the movie went at a good pace the movie was incredible imo and everyone says fight scenes were the highlight and i agree most of the movie is fight scenes anyway cgi was perfectly fine and all i gotta say is modern marvel could never
Oct 22 2022,positive,the movie was great
Oct 22 2022,negative,only the rock fans would fine this movie enjoyable
Oct 22 2022,negative,for a franchise that continues to reboot their main characters i go into the secondary character movies with no expectations this was terrible and i do not know how this is anywhere above 50 for audience reviews even with no expectations why hold this from the shazam movie if youre not going to develop the villain and purpose of the wizards they basically added a muscular dude flying around stiff in a suit with his knee up superheros fighting for 50 minutes in the middle of the movie and ending with an animated villain which lived in hell that couldnt  do damaged or fight  seriously they made the kid with the skateboard more tough than the villain
Oct 22 2022,positive,solid action scenes good laugh out loud moments somewhat in depth character development the rock had a performance different from his typical movies overall the movie was great if you enjoy superhero movies the after credit scene was fun too
Oct 22 2022,positive,finally a real superhero dc movie the rock is fantastic in black adam brosnan is a perfect doctor fate the plot is very interesting and the post  credit scene finally henry cavill is back  if it had been a little darker snyder style for example it would have been even better  still great movie
Oct 22 2022,positive,great action great cast and dj was born to play this role this movie was fun from start to finish and didnt take itself too seriously dc has a hit with fans too bad critics dont agree
Oct 22 2022,positive,it was 3 outta 5 stars for me i liked it thought it couldve been better

Oct 22 2022,positive,acting was a little flat at times by the side characters but i loved the story and the action
Oct 22 2022,positive,great movie loved it good storyline throughout from when tethadam was introduced til the mid credit scene  never a dull moment and action packed not sure what the critics were watching they always seem to spoil a really good movie for everyone a must see and recommended to see this movie

Oct 22 2022,positive,while it wasnt perfect i very much enjoyed everyones performance and the visual effects
Oct 22 2022,positive,it was enjoyable to sit and watch the story was a little rocky but was just fine to watch glad i dont listen to the critics remember they said star wars was a terrible movie
Oct 22 2022,positive,i like this movie well done looking forward to what rock will do with the dceu things are looking bright for all of us who like dc the movie is very reminiscent of man of steel which i liked a lot    hope they get zack snyder so he gets the opportunity to make mos 2 and jl23    otherwise great movie to watch
Oct 22 2022,positive,i just love this movie all the action  more action and all the smashing and explosions and the special effects were just awesome in my opinion i loved the theme which was kind of believable but this is entertainment so liberties can be taken its a movie  all the actors did a great job i liked the characters and i loved the costumes which fit all the bodies to a tee which i absolutely enjoyed to the fullest  great movie awesome special effectsawesome movie cant wait for the next one
Oct 22 2022,negative,that was objectively bad fans shouldnt praise it just for dc to get a win this was just a bad movie

Oct 22 2022,positive,absolutely loved the movie although it has its flaws it was really fun and entertaining
Oct 22 2022,negative,pretty goofy overall the other dc heroes were fun but the rock is playing himself again
Oct 22 2022,positive,great movie loved dr fate
Oct 22 2022,positive,movie is entertaining not the best super hero movie in general but it does the job good to watch only one time
Oct 22 2022,positive,great movie a must watch starting of a new era
Oct 22 2022,positive,a typical plot good cinema work but not enough depth to consider it a great movie
Oct 22 2022,positive,this was a very good awesome superhero movie good action good characters and a well balanced storyline and maybe the first roc movie that didnt feel like it was the roc playing himself
Oct 22 2022,positive,not as good as other dc films emphasis is on demi god power and self centeredness excellent cgi storyline is fair but very little sub plots very very violent
Oct 22 2022,neutral,mediocre film not bad but not good heard the reviews were poor but love the rock so went anyway wait till its free on the usa network and somewhat pay attention while talking to friends and youll tolerate it overall blasse 
Oct 22 2022,positive,this was really good
Oct 22 2022,positive,that was awesome  movie
Oct 22 2022,positive,i loved the movie so much hope theres a part 2
Oct 22 2022,negative,i was sooooo disappointed in this movie yes it kept me entertained for 2 hours but not all that well  many times i jumped out of the movie because dj just couldnt act in a believable fashion  dj plays one character in all his moviesnot unlike arnie back in the days   too many situations and inferences in the movie that made me go what huh what does that mean    for eg i am a long long longtime hawkman fan and i found aldis hodge brought a lot to the role   we finally see hawkman in action that it not cringeworthy  but the script brought in so little of the rich albeit sometimes convoluted comic book narrative about hawkman   why did they spoiler turn carter hall into tony stark why why  why have him living in charles xaviers mansion instead of letting him sleep in his museum office in a hammock   i dunno  i am assuming there is some magic backstage formula that movie companies just keep going to over and over again      i do hope it still acts as a springboard to better and more thoughtful dc movies  i see hodge is suggesting a standalone hawkman movie  hope it happens
Oct 22 2022,positive,heard it was not good luckily those people must have been sleeping through the movie it was great
Oct 22 2022,positive,if you like the rock superhero action movies bet you like this one
Oct 22 2022,positive,my new favorite superhero after iron man
Oct 22 2022,positive,i dont care what anyone says this was a great movie and dwayne johnson did an excellent job
Oct 22 2022,positive,i enjoyed the action scenes it was the best movie ive seen in a while
