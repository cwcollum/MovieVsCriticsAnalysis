Oct 6 2023,positive, mad max fury road wasnt the biggest hit film of the summer of 2015 that honor belongs to jurassic world but it is easily the most visceral and the most intelligent action film of that year decades in the making theres nothing else like this out there directed by george miller who made the first three mad max movies most famously the road warrior this installment falls somewhere between the original mad max and thunderdome and stars tom hardy as max the character originally played by mel gibson and reimagined as a loner haunted by the memory of the daughter he failed to save fury road sweeps you up in its stunning stunt work and action set pieces and the sheer momentum of its drive while sneaking in observations on power and patriarchy and control and even sneaking in an unexpected hero charlize therons imperator furiosa a warrior big rig driver with a prosthetic arm she flees the despot immortan joe with the property he most values his concubines sex slaves by any other name furiosa vows to bring the women who looks like runway models in desert chic rags to the green place the promised land of freedom of her youth while every vehicle in running order takes off in hot pursuit through the badlands of the ruined world max literally dragged into the chase ends up joining the escape team out of opportunity reluctantly at first and then inspired by the passion and hope that drives furiosa the first half of the film is a seemingly nonstop chase though miller is so adept at conducting the rise and fall of the action that you forget it often stops to cool the engines before revving back up the second half is a race with max and furiosa taking the fight back to citadel to offer an alternative to joes warrior religion designed to keep his soldiers not merely loyal but eager for glory in battle and a bloodline that has slid to the decidedly deformed and subhuman end of the spectrum the film is best experienced on the big screen where its size and scale can be appreciated so even home viewings should be on as big a screen as possible in a situation that minimizes distractions you want to give yourself the opportunity to be pulled into the momentum of this film and drawn into the vividly imagined tribal world with its rituals and totems and scavenged cars mixed and matched into weaponized vehicles details matter here you dont get exposition you get illustration and then put the puzzle pieces together to understand how this world works thats another reason i love this film so much what appears to be a simple chase film lets you discover an entire culture by the time its over nicholas hoult plays nux the boy solder who becomes an unexpected ally hugh keaysbyrne is the tyrannical immortan joe and zoë kravitz rosie huntingtonwhiteley riley keough and abbey lee  are the young brides who are forged into warriors through the course of their odyssey it won six academy awards including best editing production design and other technical awards and four bafta awards and was picked as the best film of 2015 by the los angeles film critics boston film critics online film critics society and dozens of other organizations and film critics dont miss a single recommendation subscribe to the stream on demand weekly newsletter your email address will not be shared and follow us on facebook and x formerly known as twitter sean axmaker is a seattle film critic and writer he writes the weekly newspaper column stream on demand and the companion website and his work appears at rogerebertcom turner classic movies online the film noir foundation and parallax view
Aug 3 2023,positive, thirtysix years ago george millers mad max roared into theaters with its own brand of sadistic brutality and blind vengeance while utterly captivating generations of action buffs through two additional and increasingly bizarre sequels miller and his mad max franchise inspired a global following of diehard fans rarely does a sequel capture the magic of its predecessor the godfather part ii is the foremost exception that proves the rule and a reboot doing so is almost entirely unheard of mad max fury road shows no mercy in its destruction of such a concept and countless other filmmaking conventions somewhat formulaic in its presentation of mad max staples millers fury road utilizes these franchise hallmarks as a means of transporting the audience right back into the postapocalyptic world it abandoned in 1985 newsreel footage of nuclear tests behind an introductory narration similar to harold baigents in mad max 2 the road warrior set the tone for a movie placed squarely in the heart of a barren radioactive hellscape max rocktansky the iconic hero now portrayed by the capable tom hardy is still on the run from bands of war boys and the ghosts of his past consumed by a creeping insanity and a distain for all living things a pursuit is brought to a close when maxs trusty interceptor v8 breathes its last our hero delivered into the bowels of immortan joes citadel an incredible return for hugh keaysbyrne the narrative leaves max to his fate in order to follow imperator furiosa charlize theron behind the wheel of her monstrous war machine on a run to collect gasoline discovering furiosa has deceived him immortan joe calls upon his war parties to retrieve his stolen property at all costs and the lucky max accompanies the marauding hoard as a blood bag for the battleweakened war boy nux nicholas hoult a film divided into several breathtaking acts mad max fury road relentlessly endeavors for pure action each segment becomes an escalating series of audacious stunts and bloodpumping orchestration on a grand scale miller concerns himself not with the trivialities of world building but with the individual character motivations as they pertain to the story strong female characters as essential to the plot as their male counterparts proliferate and are an appreciated addition to a genre long ignorant of women each character has their individual arc along with a ridiculous full name and each weaves seamlessly into the overall narrative superfluity is washed away to pay homage to the all powerful adrenaline rush a prior understanding of the three previous mad max entries is not required to enjoy the fourth installment only a love for action splendor and a desire for more as outstanding as the direction and script may be fury roads monumental vision does not rely on millers talents alone striking cinematography from john seale stresses the bitter extremes of life in maxs fantastic world while sundrenched reds and yellows dominate the daytime palate in dramatic opposition to the cool vibrant blues that prevail after the sun goes down tight inventive editing from margaret sixel and jason ballantine capture the immediacy of the endless desert chases without disorientating the audience and perhaps the most valuable contributions to millers vision are from junkie xls thumping score matched with some of the most invariably perfect stunts in recent memory going so far as to give pieces of the composition a physical presence in the film a large tympani and flamespewing electric guitar speaker mobile the writers are acutely aware of how influential music can be on the audience elevating the vehicular carnage from a beautiful motocross circus to a life or death struggle between good and evil junkie xls score infuses untold alarm into every action set piece inconceivable work from keir beck stuntrigging coordinator marius botha stunt department coordinator guy norris supervising stunt coordinator and anna wood stunt department coordinator give fury road an entrancing realness through action sequences that are above and beyond anything ever before millers refreshing sense of gender equality contrasts an apocalyptic world in stark opposition by promoting an immensely powerful cinematic and real world message surpassing expectations and delivering a heaping dose of electrifying visuals mad max fury road is what all blockbuster action movies should strive to be jordan brooks viewtoaqueue is an increasinglysnobby cinefile based out of sunny san diego california as a contributor to several online publications including his own blog he has succeeded in fulfilling his life long dream of imposing strong opinions on others

Jan 23 2023,positive, many onset behind the scenes videos alternate extremely mundane footage of the business of getting coverage with actors rotely reciting how amazing and wonderful everybody involved in this production is not so this casually intense assemblage of work on mad max fury road which begins with a car flipping over what follows is not quite as routinely lifethreatening but its still incredibly physical filmmaking 150 million it seems will buy you the budget to stand in the desert sling a camera around on a very flexible boom and have some guys swing around on poles
Aug 23 2022,positive, has it really been 30 years since mel gibson last drove across george millers dystopian desert wasteland in mad max beyond thunderdome my how time flies between 1979 and 1985 visionary filmmaker miller gave us three films the intriguing but lethargic mad max the fabulous cult classic the road warrior and the fun but commercial beyond thunderdome while the second film was the real standout i have always had a natural soft spot for the entire franchise so of course i would be enthusiastic when it was announced that a fourth installment was finally seeing the light of day for years miller has toyed with the idea of bringing max back to the big screen but there were always obstacles that hindered him mel gibson was set to reprise his role and at several points the project seemed good to go several years have passed tom hardy replaces the aged gibson and fury road is a reality whats truly amazing is that this is the wildest craziest and most visually arresting installment yet and all from the mind of its now 70year old creator the first three films had a combined budget of less than 20 million for fury road miller was given 150 million and you will instantly see the benefits the visuals are an essential component to this film this is an unapologetic fullthrottle thrill ride and a textbook lesson on how to make an action movie make no mistake the action in fury road  is intense and relentless the vehicular carnage is unlike anything most people have seen before the story is a bit lightweight and clearly intended to serve the plots madness this all may be enough to scare away some people for me it was the films unflinching fuelinjected focus that made it the best movie experience ive had this year so far the film opens with a gruff hardy saying my name is max my world is fire and blood his world is an energystarved postapocalyptic desert wasteland where he is haunted by his past and driven only by survival within the first few minutes the nomadic max is captured by the army of a savage and wickedly grotesque tyrant named immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne maxs capture leads him to cross paths with imperator furiosa charlize theron who attempts to smuggle joes five enslaved childbearing wives to safety this invokes the wrath of the maniacal leader who brings his entire army after them and guess what max is caught right in the middle i cant think of a more fitting actor to take on the role of mad max than tom hardy his dialogue is sparse and he mainly tells his story through grunts expressions and outright physicality and he does it all to sheer perfection its a very unorthodox role hes not asked to say much and he spends a good third of the movie with his face partially obscured by a metal contraption but he masterfully sells us this tough surly and untrusting max character but the real surprise was watching charlize theron match his toughness punch for punch and bullet for bullet she is so good here but of course the true star and the main attraction is george miller and his insanely energetic action and presentation fury road is a visual delight  a movie filled with wow moments unbelievable stunts and mindblowing vehicle action sequences miller shoots his action with a chaotic precision and cinematic fluidity many modern action directors should take notes but equally impressive are the stunning amount of practical effects used when mixed with the topnotch cgi it makes this one amazing looking film and going along with the stellar visuals is junkie xls vibrant and invigorating score some of us had given up on mad max ever returning to the big screen after 30 years it was a reasonable conclusion but after seeing fury road i can boldly say it was worth the wait george miller has given us an installment that stands right there with and probably an inch or two above his phenomenal the road warrior this is pure action cinema  a beautiful mixture of oldschool style and modern movie technology and after this taste of millers vision i can only hope he has more mad max movies plan for the future my favorite film of the year so far this is how an action film ought to work i am not disappointed in hardy i just dont think he jumps off the screen the way mel did and as the character is almost a secondary foil in the conflict here that made max less the focus than i thought  he would be the sequences and visualizations are terrific i know hollywood is ageist at least against anyone not named marty or clint but this shows why visionaries are more important than fresh faces sometimes you have to invent a world and inhabit it to be able to get it right my favorite too i left on such a high good straightforward story that sets up some of the coolest action sequences i have seen in a while i really liked hardy but i do get what youre saying about him also loved this and gave it the same score to be honest i think i might head to the cinema again to watch this oneamazing experience great work here keith i am so amped to see this and your review gets me even more excited lots of good reviews i hope it doesnt disappoint i enjoyed this movie way more than i expected to its exciting and extremely rare to see a big budget summer blockbuster with such a personal vision and executed so well brought the big screen definitely my favorite of the year so far same here honestly i expected to like it a lot but i didnt expect to love it the way i did this was good crazy fun i left the theater on such a high excellent review it goes without saying that action cinema this singular in scale and scope is rare and millers conviction in bringing this fourth installment of his brainchild to life has yielded quite the exceptional result thanks so much i agree with you there is a lot of conviction behind miller and his vision for this film and man what a ride i went and saw it today  absolutely nuts  i loved every minute of it  its probably my favorite action movie of the year  i certainly think its better than ultron in every single way  its a shame they dont make movies like this very often and certainly not the way that george miller does it  but i will be seeing it again thats for sure  the soundtrack is amazing too  with tom hardy signed on for three more movies i cant wait to see where they go from here yes so fun i think miller is such a visionary and his eye for action is superb this thing was crazy and i loved how he never dialed back the madness cant wait to watch it again oh im definitely going to see it again as well  i also loved the fact that they didnt use the shakycam technique unless it was inside the vehicles  as far as action movies go mad max fury road has set the bar very high this year  i dont see anything else thats going to top it in terms of sheer adrenaline you bring up a great point that i meant to mention in the review the lack of the annoying shakycam was so refreshing i get annoyed at the technique so many directors should take note unashamed relentless action and i are it up there is such a wild style on display and i just couldnt get enough bravo george miller never ending action in this movie really u can get tired while watching but i didnt see very well our max u know mel gibson is better crazy i think hes in life crazy tom hardy is just silent cool guy i love that i was so proud the academy recognized the movie the way it did there was a time when it would have never gotten the consideration it deserved  i have to say its now one of my favorite movies  so much to love about it  the details are meticulous and inventive  the kid who decides to help them is one of my favorite characters  cant remember his name
Jun 21 2022,positive, a marvelous degree of craziness and discipline was required to make mad max fury road australian director george millers reimagining of or perhaps a belated sequel to his original ozploitation trilogy three decades after taking down blaster in thunderdome mad max returns for the fourth most inventive and bombastic entry in this series of postapocalyptic vehicle wars a completely bonkers and titillating piece of entertainment that has no recent equal indeed the fast and furious series looks populated by slogging pacifists in comparison tom hardy now occupies mel gibsons wellworn leather duds as the titular max rockatansky a former cop turned reluctant road warrior on millers unforgiving barren but beautifully conceived highways of carnage this desolate world comes fuelled by adrenaline soiled with gruesome ultraviolence and propelled by unbelievably outrageous highspeed chases unlike anything youve ever seen after defining the postapocalyptic subgenre in 1979 with the original mad max and its two sequels miller now in his seventies shows no signs of slowing based on this decadent display of practical effects impressive pyrotechnics and exhilarating showmanship in recent years millers name has been associated with more childfriendly material such as babe pig in the city 1998 happy feet 2006 happy feet two 2011 and some development on warner bros abandoned 2008 production of a justice league superhero film but in the years after mad max beyond thunderdome 1985 miller fed rumors of another mad max sequel news of countless setbacks false starts delays budgetary quarrels and casting rumors have filled hollywood insider trades for more than a decadegoing back to when gibson was still set to reprise the role that made him a star as time went on and gibson got older as early as 2009 miller recast the role with hardy hired charlize theron as hardys costar and began scouting locations filming didnt begin until 2012 and lasted upwards of 120 days in namibia plus reshoots the following year with a reported budget of 150 million a far deal greater than the paltry budgets used to make the original three and despite fury road looking and feeling more expensive more overthetop and more kickass than its predecessors it still feels like a part of the same universe miller created all those years ago to be sure mad max fury road is a far more complex experience visually than the rather trim mad max yet its narrative heft feels more grandiose and adult than the familyfriendly outing mad max beyond thunderdome unavoidably and quite complementarily the film earns its close association to the second and best in the series the road warrior 1981 which like this latest entry occupies its runtime with what amounts to a single filmlong chase sequence however conceptually simple fury roads actionized chase scenario may seem on the surface miller and his cowriters nico lathouris and comic author brendan mccarthy layer the material with heavy themes of redemption revolution and buried memories each of millers mad max films have had their own unique pitch and themes the first concerned tragedy and revenge the strippingdown of maxs humanity the second displayed a glimmer of hope in our antihero within his otherwise thankless world and the third found him regaining his human sympathy by rescuing a group of children mad max fury road finds the antihero more animallike a mad dog survivor realized by hardy with paranoid eyes and convulsive jolts into his tragic past my world is reduced to a single instinct survive he says in the opening narration which recalls a more personalized version of the prologue in the road warrior max moves with a kinetic ferocity almost on autopilot especially early on when hardys considerable physical presence is enhanced by miller running the film speed at a higher rate as if max has been electrified during the fracas max who remains nameless for much of the picture receives flashes from his past and images of his daughters death haunt him at key moments he seems to have buried these images so deep that he no longer understands their meaning to the extent that he even looks confused by their appearance in his mind as the world fell it was hard to know who was more crazy me or everyone else he observes only as the story progresses and max finds someone to fight alongside do those images become clearer although refreshingly miller never explains their origin through clumsy expositional dialogue or a flashback maxs understanding comes by way of a calmer more gathered expression behind hardys piercing blue eyes but lets not get ahead of ourselves in the distant postapocalypse of millers vision human beings are the new precious commodity forget fuel and ammunition gas town and the bullet farm have that covered only sandswept roads and dunes flourish in the wasteland leaving humans with no chance unless they suffer under the citadela pair of buttes standing alone in the desert inhabited by the cultish ruler on high the fearsome immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne who played the marauding toecutter presumably no relation in the original mad max his body serves as a metaphor for the entire landscape scorched and harsh patched together by body plates pieces of old hardware breathing tubes and a toothy mask what a horrific kingdom he has made where he controls his slaves by regulating the water supply and where his beautiful wives are branded as property and locked in a vault elsewhere in the citadel he keeps rotund mothers strapped to pumps to deliver valuable breastmilk for trade and their human babies his sires provide the capital for an army of devoted subjects should an unlucky wasteland survivor find himself captured by the rulers personal army of war boys hed be tattooed with his blood type and organ status and hanged upsidedown as a human blood bag for immortan joes weak or dying devotees one such blood bag is max himself interned in the first scene and hung to fuel nux nicholas hoult one of immortan joes shaved branded whitepainted and skeletonfaced fanatical soldiers following his leaders abstract religion nux has been promised glory and another life in valhalla should he faithfully serve immortan joe and spray his mouth silver before the moment of death enter the noblewomanbadass imperator furiosa theron whos entrusted to drive a war rig on a fuel run but instead detours with immortan joes escaped wives to liberate them from captivity millers flair for wild names carries on with the wives splendid capable cheedo the fragile and toast the knowing these wives look like a gaggle of supermodels and first appear in a wet fantasy scene however theyre gradually empowered throughout the chase in response nux straps a metalmasked max onto the front grille of his car and along with a small army of soupedup vehicles pursues glory to recoup immortan joes property for the next two hours the ensuing chase sequence driven by millers breakneck pace offers only a few fleeting seconds of reprieve from the mayhem and oh what mayhemwhat glorious delightfully orchestrated mayhem supposedly ninety percent of the effects and stunts were achieved without cgi and based on the result it looks to be true a staggering level of pyrotechnics and car wrecks appear to have been achieved with practical effects and stuntmen something of a rarity in todays market of computergenerated aerobatics in fast and furious ever the tactile tactician miller captures every angle imaginable and at varying film speeds thanks to the feverish work of cinematographer john seale whose frame vibrates with the speed of his carmounted cameras still never is there a moment where the clarity of the situation or shotbyshot logic is questioned rather the impossibly fastpaced momentum proceeds with a shocking and almost unheardof degree of precision all of it given an incredible dose of aural energy thanks to dutch musician junkie xls score throughout millers editor and wife margaret sixelour allows us to briefly appreciate colin gibsons intricate production design and jenny beavans imaginative costumes with every new shot there are more details to savor that require repeated viewings to fully appreciate the slave ship whose sole purpose is to provide the chase with drums and riffing from a heavy metal flamespewing guitar the poleriding daredevils who swing from one vehicle to another performed by members of cirque du soleil the grotesque growths piercings and body markings displayed by postapocalyptical mutants and the believable robotic forearm attached to furiosa in fact furiosa may just steal the film from under maxs nose after their characters meet and join forces on the road a ferocious driver and brutal fighter furiosa represents a rare thing in the mad max franchise a strong female character she doesnt trust max at first having experienced firsthand the savagery of men in the postapocalypse therons troubled glassy eyes contain all the emotional charge needed in this vicious film and they remind us of renee falconettis sorrowful expressions in the passion of joan of ark 1928 her quest to transport the childbearing female captors to salvation is immediately empathetic while maxs hardened exterior seems as pitiless as the world he inhabits hardy meanwhile is perfect in his role its impossible to imagine another modern actor recreating mad max so effectively hes capable of rendering both maxs animalistic and nobler scenes with careful calibration of his face you know hope is a mistake he tells furiosa in one of their few audible exchanges dialogue is a luxury in a film like this and miller has said he intended the film to be such a visual experience that it could play in foreign countries without subtitles fortunately actors of hardy and therons caliber need only brief glances to communicate a wealth of understanding between the two characters during the films neverending pursuit
May 17 2022,positive,it is the rare beautiful film that can take even the most staunch of cinephiles and reduce them to a giddy child flush with excitement and rooting for the heroes to win
Feb 11 2022,positive, in fact there hasnt been a movie to come along like this in quite some time the fourth postapocalyptic max rockatansky film from multitalented director george miller mad max fury road showcases a level of craft and kinetic energy that feels transported from a simpler time in blockbuster filmmaking instead of installing a franchise building block introducing 500 plot lines for future films or encumbering the pace with heavy exposition fury road charges right at you from the start and refuses to let up its a relentless adventure saddled with enough original action and gripping chase sequences to wrap around as many dystopian deserts you can find miller last forayed into the action genre with his third max film 1985s mad max beyond thunderdome so this is the first time the auteur has had the visual treasure chest of the 21st century with which to work having spent plenty of time with practical effects in his heyday miller fuses the rust and dust of personallycrafted sets and effects with the otherworldly possibilities of computer generated visuals to create some of the more striking sequences put on screen in a while he also helped write the screenplay with brendan mccarthy and nico lathouris fury road takes a page from screenwriting 101 and lets the movie do the talking not the characters instead of a 15minute introduction into how this apocalyptic world became to be the film jumps right into maxs now a loner bothered by a dark past max tom hardy is captured by an army of pale soldiers and is taken to the citadel a refuge for survivors governed by king immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne the impressivelydesigned joe is a hulking creation complete with beaming redandyellow eyes prowrestlers hair and physique and a mask that looks like a cross between banes from the dark knight rises and the intimidation art that goes on the headgear of a hockey goalie maxs capture eventually crosses over into a plot to save joes many wives from bondage  an effort led by government highup imperator furiosa charlize theron hauling a large tanker across an unforgiving desert on the infamous fury road furiosa botches a gas trip and breaks for freedom with her passengers but joes army  an assortment of his brainwashed followers driving terrifying mixandmatch hot wheels  isnt too far behind so with max placed as a hood ornament on one of the soldiers the eager nux played by nicolas hoult cars  the race begins leading into two hours of dustypedaltotherustymetal insanity the chase scenes in the film are oneofakind  special scenes that havent been done before and likely wont be replicated in the future miller keeps them snapping along with great precision mixing in thrill after thrill and close call after close call the realandunreal effects and soaring stunt work help make the zooming chases at times feel almost iconic junkie xl adds in an operatic score that backs the action in a way that feels legitimately epic one sequence in particular  a chase through a technicolor sandstorm of tornados lighting and blinding gusts  has to be seen on the biggest screens possible as does the rest of this movie for that matter its a scene of premiere vfx work and perhaps the most impressive visual scene to ever hit a movie screen in years john seales gorgeous cinematography gets a bulk of the credit for the films visual presentation seale plays around with the color scheme in certain situations to great effect and brings forth a sharp presentation for the entire film hardy and theron make for solid leads with the physicallydemanding role requirements met by each with ease as the film progresses both max and furiosa begin to develop a silent friendship which must become possible through various glances in strenuous situations both actors do a splendid job of being able to get affection across in the midst of all the chaos hoult also makes a solid mark as the spiny nux with mad max fury road miller is able to make a nearlyflawless popcorn film with ingredients that most studios would shy away from this is weird livedin material that puts a great deal of trust in its audience to read between the lines into how the mechanics of this world work the payments are as rich as they are rewarding no other studio film this year will feature a guitarplaying battle musician with flames shooting out of the instruments head a babyman with a beard and a twoheaded lizard that slithers across the barren dirt mad max fury road is a slobbernocking achievement that also happens to be a singular experience best seen on the most gargantuan screen possible with friends soda candy and a jaw that can be dropped at will
Oct 9 2021,positive, its been over thirty years since the last film in the mad max series and man did it come back in a big way there is no other way to describe mad max fury road as anything other than overthetop highoctane fun if you can watch it in imax 3d if you can watch it in a dolby atmos theater do it fury road is every inch the combination of postapocalyptic exaggeration mixed with some hilarious insights into human nature if there was ever a film detailing the often foolish choices of man its fury road the story is a simple one but while that might inhibit most films for something as boisterously loud and active as fury road it only serves as the frame to the sensory overload warner brossustained on nothing more than revenge redemption and gasoline fury road brings tom hardys mad max and charlize therons imperator furiosa together as two avenging angels in a world that has thrown morals and human dignity into the wind for a film that includes a consistent heavy metal guitarist on a jury rigged mountain of speakers that drives around as the hilarious but totally unnecessary mood music fury road manages to still deliver a punch through the storytelling that stands somewhere between environmental political commentary and straight up hardlined feminism but trust me almost all of that takes a back seat to the absolutely breathtaking visual palette of fury road splashed in tones of yellow orange and red and later deep midnight blue its a gorgeous piece of art from the yellowgold sandstorms that swallow the outback to the neon flares that explode like fireworks in the sky it is unforgiving in painting the world with explosive color warner brosif the visuals dont keep you on the edge of your seat then the roar of the engines sure will not to mention that killer soundtrack visual effects dominate your eyes while the sound of roaring engines firing bullets and pounding drums will fill your ears there are no pulled punches here and it works out perfectly youll be cheering and howling with furiosa and max in no time there is no other alternative final thoughts the definition of a wholly unapologetically actionpacked film mad max fury road breathes new life into an old series and throws you right back into a world that is hyperbolic and addictive all at once
Aug 29 2021,positive,its hard to see another movie equalling this ones grand ambition deep ideas and aweinspiring action
Aug 12 2021,negative,in a film with such a strong female lead how could george miller write such thoroughly forgettable supporting characters also how in the hell is zoë kravitz the sole black person in this future earth
Aug 12 2021,positive, yo mutha flowers a bunch of us went to go see mad max fury road this past weekend had we known how incredible it was going to be we would have organized a caravan of all you beautiful queers across the country to come together and watch it as a pack a sexy renegade pack of unapologetic feminists ready to blow shit up in the name of freedom and solidarity but even on our own in our own hometowns in separate movie theaters we watched and fell in love with the delicious deliriuminducing debauchery that is mad max fury road one of my favorite things about this movie was that it not only had its hard butch heroine in furiosa but that the five wives who were presented as being these beautiful feminine helpless girls who were coddled and pampered but also sex slaves also got their chances to shine and have some really cool action moments all of the women in this movie were capable not just the one named capable toast the knowing cheedo the fragile the splendid angharad capable and the dag has there ever been a movie with cooler character names all did things that helped ensure their survival none of them were helpless damsels in distress and lets not forget the vuvalini who give us even more diverse kickass women there were just so many awesome women in this movie charlize theron delivers a captivating challenging performance as furiosa arguably her best since monster as she barrels across the desert in a soupedup war rig to carry five angelic badass women to a search for hope those women each embody their own strength and grace overcoming fear and internalized misogyny to create a vision for a new life instead of forming a chorus of interchangeable former sex slaves they are five women with their own goals struggles and connections to each other and other characters i want to watch the movie again and focus only on their experiences with and reactions to the horror unfolding around them because there is immense texture within their stories we only spend real time with two male characters in the film max whose struggle with ptsd is one of the most honest portrayals of mental illness ive ever seen on film and who seems perfectly happy to play backup to furiosas commandership and nux whose transformation from mindless frothing henchman to a helper who finds his beating heart through the kindness of freed slave capable speaks deep truth about allyship and sacrificing our own privilege to pursue liberation for all charlize theron carried the weight of the films emotional journey and managed to do so even though pretty much the whole entire film was a high speed car chase tom hardy as max though the title character was pretty much eye candy i actually fucking love tom hardy hes crazy talented and not sore on the eyes either but i felt like his mad max was a little introverted okay but those sister wives are what confuse me in a film with such a strong female lead how could george miller write such thoroughly forgettable supporting characters zoë kravitz and abbey lee stood out against the rest of the damsels in distress as genuinely talented but the others werent really given the opportunity also  not that i expect anything more from a big budget hollywood action film  but how in the hell is zoë kravitz the sole black person in this future earth am i to infer that when hell broke loose the people of color were the first to go because thats actually how ive been making sense of it also not that i expect anything more from a big budget hollywood action film but how in the hell is zoe kravitz the sole black person in this future earth am i to infer that when hell broke loose the people of color were the first to go charlize therons furiosa is the hbic in this movie i had my palm raised to the universe the second she took control of that big rig and led the charge across the desert shes tough like hellafucken tough and i wanted to be in the rig with her shes over dealing with some patriarchal violent goon dudemonster hes a rapist a slave owner and hes hoarding all the natural resources like the ceo of nestle and charlizes furiosa is ready to snatch his postapocalyptic reign of terror and take her enslaved homegirls with her and she does furiosa fights like a ufc champ and did we mention thats shes an amputee all praise our homegirls that are disabled cuz they can and will fuck shit up and lead us into the promised land hallelu mad max fury road feels revolutionary the film is essentially a twohour chase scene complete with infinite gunshots and explosions a few desolate wastelands and a fantastical rig where halfliving goons beat the drums  and shred the flaming guitars  of war inside these trappings mad max tells the stories of powerful women fighting furiously for liberation holy cow i loved this movie like who woulda thought that a mel gibson movie franchise would have turned into an awesome movie about a bunch of ladies looking badass and powerful and beautiful and then acting even more badass and powerful and beautiful i also loved that while the movie is called mad max max is at best an ancillary character the movie could have easily happened without him it was antirape antimilitary antitotalitarianism and strongly prowomen i mean it was pretty much just a group of women fighting against toxic masculinity and doing it in a movie genre thats normally reserved for celebrating toxic masculinity this movie was so straight up antipatriarchy it was amazing the whole plot was about them trying to escape or defeat the evil hypermasculine world of the citadel and the men who run it it was antirape antimilitary antitotalitarianism and strongly prowomen i mean it was pretty much just a group of women fighting against toxic masculinity and doing it in a movie genre thats normally reserved for celebrating toxic masculinity it was all about these wives who were sex slaves to the immortan joe but as kate leth pointed out on twitter there wasnt actually any sexual violence in the movie which is pretty amazing for a postapocalyptic action movie about sex slaves i liked mad max because it shows us what will happen if men continue to be in charge they will destroy everything and develop a weird obsession with breast milk though this movies plot is literally oh we have to go to this one place oops no lets go back and it explains so little of what youre expected to just accept as the reality of the situation i still enjoyed it at one point men are only allowed to stay with a group of badass women because they are competent which is a pretty low bar but still not the standard men are held to today i also like that the baby man army is nursed back to health via blood because its furr shurr a shout out to periods other favorite moments include finding which men could not keep a beat in any scene with drums overall it is one of those movies where like no one cares that you can barely understand what the characters are saying because its not going to make anything make more sense also for it to be a movie that is just nonstop violence it doesnt delight in it and isnt terribly gruesome which was my concern going in i know that theres so much misandry and feminism but by far the best part of the movie is that fucking guitar situation and if you do not laugh every time it comes on screen you dont have joy in your life and i feel sorry for you at one point men are only allowed to stay with a group of badass women because they are competent which is a pretty low bar but still not the standard men are held to today this movie kicked ass i was forced to watch it in 3d because everybody i was with wanted to but i grinned through the nausea because there is not a moment in this film where really hot people arent kicking so much butt i fucking love action movies i love highspeed car chases tough af oneliners and explosions unfortunately i dont enjoy watching men do stuff unless theyre helping old ladies cross the street or carrying newborns in baby bjorns im so completely over the whole watch men blow things up to save people  here are some titties movie genre so im not ever trying to pay money to see maledominated actions movies that often get their kicks from exploiting women and praising the brutality of men i really really didnt want to see mad max but then gabby told me that mras were protesting it and would i please go see it with her and i did a 180 and was like heck yes so obviously i loved this movie pretty much the only thing i didnt like was the soundtrack since talking about movies isnt really my forte i thought id rewrite the soundtrack with a little help from ms rivera herself i made an alternate soundtrack full of songs that fit mad maxs feminista vibe what songs would you want to hear chicks smashing cars and the patriarchy to so there you have it gorgeous warriors of the desert now if you havent seen it round up all your best homies and make a trek to the nearest theater have a few drinks beforehand or afterwards and make a night of it go with your fists raised high and salute big stupid glorious hollywood blockbusters and what it looks like when stories arent tailored to men and their fragile egos go see what it looks like when were driving the smoking tractortrailers into the unknown and fighting for our sisters to live free gabrielle rivera is an awesomely queer bronx bred writer spoken word artist and director her short stories and poems have been published in various anthologies such as the lambda award winning portland queer tales from the rose city and the best of panic en vivo from the east village her short film spanish girls are beautiful follows a group of young latina and caucasian girls who like girls as they hook up smoke up and try to figure sht out she also freelances for autostraddlecom while working in the film and television industry gabrielle is currently working on her first novel while bouncing around nyc performing spoken word and trying to stick it to the man i saw this on sunday with friends and went into the theater with pretty much no idea other than general knowledge of the mad max movies of what it was about  it was pretty much the greatest thing ever epic car chases epic feminism and the psychotically epic doof warrior the name of the guitar character his truck is the doof wagon one warning if you are driving home after the movie be aware that the urge to start running people off the road is pretty damn strong yo oh my god i got into my car with my girlfriend and my mom after the movie and all i wanted to do was race us all into the desert navigating 95 south was thrilling and i just laughed bc i couldnt get over how juiced i felt after this ridiculous ass amazing movie doin it anyone get the name of the pretty lady whom they first come upon when shes acting as bait in the tower shes gotta be in there yall we were in a movie theater with line of men wrapped around the building to see a feminist action movie in america never did i expect to see this day  i have every intention of seeing this film since its getting such good reviews from pretty much everyone i have yet to come across any review that hated the film and i have always loved the mad max franchise in general yes even beyond thunderdome i will not apologize yeah i was also bothered by the lack of woc but like lilian says it was australia and there were two maori actresses so thats good i was basically obsessed with this entire movie but the part that got me the most when i was like yes this is the feminist action movie i have been waiting my whole life for was when the one vuvalini was naked bait in the tower and yet you never saw any gratuitous nudity even in this part that had nudity that was actually useful to the story line it was glorious i will be purchasing this movie the day it comes out and then rewatching it forever my mom dragged me almost literally to see this and not knowing anything about it i hated the first five minutes as soon as charlize theron showed up passed the bechdel test and kicked ass it won me over i gushed the whole way home  saw this movie with a fellow feminist we were literally surrounded by men in the movie theatre this movie was so kickass and loved that the leading woman was disabled also a lot of ppl have said furiosa is queer is that cannon or more just they never mentioned it so we can read it as we want there was defs a lack of people of colour in the movie which is super not okay i like that mad max was basically not necessary to the movie and how furiosa was leading this women but in a empowering ill help you if you want vs savioury way i liked that there was a fair few disabled folks in the movie i still cant believe that this movie has actually been made if there was ever a list of things hollywood executives dont want to have in their movies i think mad max has almost all of them this movie wasnt originally on my radar at all but people all over the internet okay really just cleolinda and noelle stevenson and now you guys have been telling me how good it is im so close to the end of this semester one takehome final and one lab writeup to go and have made my partner promise that well see this as soon as all my work is in are there any sexual assault scenes in this movie im seeing it in a couple of days and im trying to figure out if its gonna be too full on i think this response may be too late but no there werent i think the article above mentions this but its fantastic that a movie wherein sex slaves play a crucial role in the narrative was produced without gratuitous scenes of sexual violence this film felt like such a revelation like that movie we had been asking for when asking for a female led action movie our prayers were answered and answered awesomely its not perfect yes but its a huuuuuuuge step forward steps i hope other people will follow in the epitome of feminism for me was when one of the wives the dag comments to an elderly vuvalini keeper of the seeds about how she thought they were above that referring to the violence and then the keeper of the seeds goes on to say that because of the circumstances and the people that fuck everything up they needed to adapt and use violence but she still carried the seeds and hoped for more sorry i didnt like it you know how there is pwp porn without plot in fanfiction this movie was awp action without plot i went to see it because of the aforementioned feminism which was there and great and such a relief but there were so many logical loopholes what do these people eat how do they survive how do they produce gas that i had a hard time tuning out and whenever i managed to tune out the absurdity the guy with the guitar threw me it was amazingly beautifully shot and i was super happy about the representation of disabled folks but not my cuppa tea i need more storymore world building and myth im happy so many people liked it though because its got its heart in the right place and is very unhollywood i loved that they didnt spoonfeed us the worldbuilding its so rare to see an american movie or tv show where they dont explain everything in words and instead use visual or plotbased clues and references to show us that they have done plenty of worldbuilding and they trust us to pick up on it and one of the people in maxs flashbacks was an indigenous man but since those people were all people who max let die it probably doesnt count to me fury road is one of the best show dont tell mainstream films and i actually like that it doesnt go on lengthy expositions and lets you connect the dots via visual cues or implications and thus also allows for a quiet complexity that unveils itself in further viewings totes saw this today just so i could read this i didnt want to see the movie in the first place because i didnt even see the original one the movie was wayyyyy cool and the girls took it to the patriarchy down with the patriarchy excellent movie yea its not perfect but its on the right path i wanted more women of color and i wanted the wives to have more lines but the movie did deliver on major fronts i was so so happy mad max and furiosa didnt kiss a romance would have been so absurd and infuriating given the circumstance you know wats funny when the naked bait lady climbed down and all the vuvalini approached the rig and the bait lady pulled furiosas head to hers i literally thought hell yea theyre gonna kiss im so here for this lol but either way im fine with it some people were complaining that the wives were nothing but objects in this film precious cargo if you will like i said maybe a few more lines of dialogue wouldve shown us more personality i wish there was furiosa merchandise like any marvel character lol i didnt think id like a 2 hour carchaseandthingsblowup movie but i was strangely invested when i got home my arms were sore cause i was clenching my fists the entire time without realizing it laura i totally second the wait that is tony from skins sentiment we just started watching that show and we were confused as to why douchebag tony was everywhere in our lives stop it tony  anyway i normally dont love the genre but i enjoyed this movie for many of the reasons already mentioned strong women characters holding their own it passes the bechdel test it doesnt exploit depictions of sexual violence i still didnt know any of the wives names though and i couldnt watch any of the vulvani getting hurt noooo just let her plant those seeds in peace yall but how in the hell is zoë kravitz the sole black person in this future earth am i to infer that when hell broke loose the people of color were the first to go thats pretty much exactly how i inferred it especially since some of the earliest scenes of the film included forced head shaving forced tattooing and an eerie salute plus neonazis are all about their norse mythology so when everyone started shouting about valhalla the white supremacy behind this nondescript society seemed pretty clear i also found it historically appropriate that the only black character had been cast as a sex slave since slavery is wrought with a history of rape for the purpose of producing more slaves these points gave me a lot of ecofeminist feels which were especially compounded by the mothers milk scene im transitioning back to a vegetarian diet this week as a result

when asking for a female led action movie our prayers were answered and answered awesomely its not perfect yes but its a huuuuuuuge step forward steps i hope other people will follow in the epitome of feminism for me was when one of the wives the dag comments to an elderly vuvalini keeper of the seeds about how she thought they were above that referring to the violence and then the keeper of the seeds goes on to say that because of the circumstances and the people that fuck everything up they needed to adapt and use violence but she still carried the seeds and hoped for more sorry i didnt like it you know how there is pwp porn without plot in fanfiction this movie was awp action without plot i went to see it because of the aforementioned feminism which was there and great and such a relief but there were so many logical loopholes what do these people eat how do they survive how do they produce gas that i had a hard time tuning out and whenever i managed to tune out the absurdity the guy with the guitar threw me it was amazingly beautifully shot and i was super happy about the representation of disabled folks but not my cuppa tea i need more storymore world building and myth im happy so many people liked it though because its got its heart in the right place and is very unhollywood i loved that they didnt spoonfeed us the worldbuilding its so rare to see an american movie or tv show where they dont explain everything in words and instead use visual or plotbased clues and references to show us that they have done plenty of worldbuilding and they trust us to pick up on it and one of the people in maxs flashbacks was an indigenous man but since those people were all people who max let die it probably doesnt count to me fury road is one of the best show dont tell mainstream films and i actually like that it doesnt go on lengthy expositions and lets you connect the dots via visual cues or implications and thus also allows for a quiet complexity that unveils itself in further viewings totes saw this today just so i could read this i didnt want to see the movie in the first place because i didnt even see the original one the movie was wayyyyy cool and the girls took it to the patriarchy down with the patriarchy excellent movie yea its not perfect but its on the right path i wanted more women of color and i wanted the wives to have more lines but the movie did deliver on major fronts i was so so happy mad max and furiosa didnt kiss a romance would have been so absurd and infuriating given the circumstance you know wats funny when the naked bait lady climbed down and all the vuvalini approached the rig and the bait lady pulled furiosas head to hers i literally thought hell yea theyre gonna kiss im so here for this lol but either way im fine with it some people were complaining that the wives were nothing but objects in this film precious cargo if you will like i said maybe a few more lines of dialogue wouldve shown us more personality i wish there was furiosa merchandise like any marvel character lol i didnt think id like a 2 hour carchaseandthingsblowup movie but i was strangely invested when i got home my arms were sore cause i was clenching my fists the entire time without realizing it laura i totally second the wait that is tony from skins sentiment we just started watching that show and we were confused as to why douchebag tony was everywhere in our lives stop it tony  anyway i normally dont love the genre but i enjoyed this movie for many of the reasons already mentioned strong women characters holding their own it passes the bechdel test it doesnt exploit depictions of sexual violence i still didnt know any of the wives names though and i couldnt watch any of the vulvani getting hurt noooo just let her plant those seeds in peace yall but how in the hell is zoë kravitz the sole black person in this future earth am i to infer that when hell broke loose the people of color were the first to go thats pretty much exactly how i inferred it especially since some of the earliest scenes of the film included forced head shaving forced tattooing and an eerie salute plus neonazis are all about their norse mythology so when everyone started shouting about valhalla the white supremacy behind this nondescript society seemed pretty clear i also found it historically appropriate that the only black character had been cast as a sex slave since slavery is wrought with a history of rape for the purpose of producing more slaves these points gave me a lot of ecofeminist feels which were especially compounded by the mothers milk scene im transitioning back to a vegetarian diet this week as a result
Aug 12 2021,positive, yo mutha flowers a bunch of us went to go see mad max fury road this past weekend had we known how incredible it was going to be we would have organized a caravan of all you beautiful queers across the country to come together and watch it as a pack a sexy renegade pack of unapologetic feminists ready to blow shit up in the name of freedom and solidarity but even on our own in our own hometowns in separate movie theaters we watched and fell in love with the delicious deliriuminducing debauchery that is mad max fury road one of my favorite things about this movie was that it not only had its hard butch heroine in furiosa but that the five wives who were presented as being these beautiful feminine helpless girls who were coddled and pampered but also sex slaves also got their chances to shine and have some really cool action moments all of the women in this movie were capable not just the one named capable toast the knowing cheedo the fragile the splendid angharad capable and the dag has there ever been a movie with cooler character names all did things that helped ensure their survival none of them were helpless damsels in distress and lets not forget the vuvalini who give us even more diverse kickass women there were just so many awesome women in this movie charlize theron delivers a captivating challenging performance as furiosa arguably her best since monster as she barrels across the desert in a soupedup war rig to carry five angelic badass women to a search for hope those women each embody their own strength and grace overcoming fear and internalized misogyny to create a vision for a new life instead of forming a chorus of interchangeable former sex slaves they are five women with their own goals struggles and connections to each other and other characters i want to watch the movie again and focus only on their experiences with and reactions to the horror unfolding around them because there is immense texture within their stories we only spend real time with two male characters in the film max whose struggle with ptsd is one of the most honest portrayals of mental illness ive ever seen on film and who seems perfectly happy to play backup to furiosas commandership and nux whose transformation from mindless frothing henchman to a helper who finds his beating heart through the kindness of freed slave capable speaks deep truth about allyship and sacrificing our own privilege to pursue liberation for all charlize theron carried the weight of the films emotional journey and managed to do so even though pretty much the whole entire film was a high speed car chase tom hardy as max though the title character was pretty much eye candy i actually fucking love tom hardy hes crazy talented and not sore on the eyes either but i felt like his mad max was a little introverted okay but those sister wives are what confuse me in a film with such a strong female lead how could george miller write such thoroughly forgettable supporting characters zoë kravitz and abbey lee stood out against the rest of the damsels in distress as genuinely talented but the others werent really given the opportunity also  not that i expect anything more from a big budget hollywood action film  but how in the hell is zoë kravitz the sole black person in this future earth am i to infer that when hell broke loose the people of color were the first to go because thats actually how ive been making sense of it also not that i expect anything more from a big budget hollywood action film but how in the hell is zoe kravitz the sole black person in this future earth am i to infer that when hell broke loose the people of color were the first to go charlize therons furiosa is the hbic in this movie i had my palm raised to the universe the second she took control of that big rig and led the charge across the desert shes tough like hellafucken tough and i wanted to be in the rig with her shes over dealing with some patriarchal violent goon dudemonster hes a rapist a slave owner and hes hoarding all the natural resources like the ceo of nestle and charlizes furiosa is ready to snatch his postapocalyptic reign of terror and take her enslaved homegirls with her and she does furiosa fights like a ufc champ and did we mention thats shes an amputee all praise our homegirls that are disabled cuz they can and will fuck shit up and lead us into the promised land hallelu mad max fury road feels revolutionary the film is essentially a twohour chase scene complete with infinite gunshots and explosions a few desolate wastelands and a fantastical rig where halfliving goons beat the drums  and shred the flaming guitars  of war inside these trappings mad max tells the stories of powerful women fighting furiously for liberation holy cow i loved this movie like who woulda thought that a mel gibson movie franchise would have turned into an awesome movie about a bunch of ladies looking badass and powerful and beautiful and then acting even more badass and powerful and beautiful i also loved that while the movie is called mad max max is at best an ancillary character the movie could have easily happened without him it was antirape antimilitary antitotalitarianism and strongly prowomen i mean it was pretty much just a group of women fighting against toxic masculinity and doing it in a movie genre thats normally reserved for celebrating toxic masculinity this movie was so straight up antipatriarchy it was amazing the whole plot was about them trying to escape or defeat the evil hypermasculine world of the citadel and the men who run it it was antirape antimilitary antitotalitarianism and strongly prowomen i mean it was pretty much just a group of women fighting against toxic masculinity and doing it in a movie genre thats normally reserved for celebrating toxic masculinity it was all about these wives who were sex slaves to the immortan joe but as kate leth pointed out on twitter there wasnt actually any sexual violence in the movie which is pretty amazing for a postapocalyptic action movie about sex slaves i liked mad max because it shows us what will happen if men continue to be in charge they will destroy everything and develop a weird obsession with breast milk though this movies plot is literally oh we have to go to this one place oops no lets go back and it explains so little of what youre expected to just accept as the reality of the situation i still enjoyed it at one point men are only allowed to stay with a group of badass women because they are competent which is a pretty low bar but still not the standard men are held to today i also like that the baby man army is nursed back to health via blood because its furr shurr a shout out to periods other favorite moments include finding which men could not keep a beat in any scene with drums overall it is one of those movies where like no one cares that you can barely understand what the characters are saying because its not going to make anything make more sense also for it to be a movie that is just nonstop violence it doesnt delight in it and isnt terribly gruesome which was my concern going in i know that theres so much misandry and feminism but by far the best part of the movie is that fucking guitar situation and if you do not laugh every time it comes on screen you dont have joy in your life and i feel sorry for you at one point men are only allowed to stay with a group of badass women because they are competent which is a pretty low bar but still not the standard men are held to today this movie kicked ass i was forced to watch it in 3d because everybody i was with wanted to but i grinned through the nausea because there is not a moment in this film where really hot people arent kicking so much butt i fucking love action movies i love highspeed car chases tough af oneliners and explosions unfortunately i dont enjoy watching men do stuff unless theyre helping old ladies cross the street or carrying newborns in baby bjorns im so completely over the whole watch men blow things up to save people  here are some titties movie genre so im not ever trying to pay money to see maledominated actions movies that often get their kicks from exploiting women and praising the brutality of men i really really didnt want to see mad max but then gabby told me that mras were protesting it and would i please go see it with her and i did a 180 and was like heck yes so obviously i loved this movie pretty much the only thing i didnt like was the soundtrack since talking about movies isnt really my forte i thought id rewrite the soundtrack with a little help from ms rivera herself i made an alternate soundtrack full of songs that fit mad maxs feminista vibe what songs would you want to hear chicks smashing cars and the patriarchy to so there you have it gorgeous warriors of the desert now if you havent seen it round up all your best homies and make a trek to the nearest theater have a few drinks beforehand or afterwards and make a night of it go with your fists raised high and salute big stupid glorious hollywood blockbusters and what it looks like when stories arent tailored to men and their fragile egos go see what it looks like when were driving the smoking tractortrailers into the unknown and fighting for our sisters to live free gabrielle rivera is an awesomely queer bronx bred writer spoken word artist and director her short stories and poems have been published in various anthologies such as the lambda award winning portland queer tales from the rose city and the best of panic en vivo from the east village her short film spanish girls are beautiful follows a group of young latina and caucasian girls who like girls as they hook up smoke up and try to figure sht out she also freelances for autostraddlecom while working in the film and television industry gabrielle is currently working on her first novel while bouncing around nyc performing spoken word and trying to stick it to the man i saw this on sunday with friends and went into the theater with pretty much no idea other than general knowledge of the mad max movies of what it was about  it was pretty much the greatest thing ever epic car chases epic feminism and the psychotically epic doof warrior the name of the guitar character his truck is the doof wagon one warning if you are driving home after the movie be aware that the urge to start running people off the road is pretty damn strong yo oh my god i got into my car with my girlfriend and my mom after the movie and all i wanted to do was race us all into the desert navigating 95 south was thrilling and i just laughed bc i couldnt get over how juiced i felt after this ridiculous ass amazing movie doin it anyone get the name of the pretty lady whom they first come upon when shes acting as bait in the tower shes gotta be in there yall we were in a movie theater with line of men wrapped around the building to see a feminist action movie in america never did i expect to see this day  i have every intention of seeing this film since its getting such good reviews from pretty much everyone i have yet to come across any review that hated the film and i have always loved the mad max franchise in general yes even beyond thunderdome i will not apologize yeah i was also bothered by the lack of woc but like lilian says it was australia and there were two maori actresses so thats good i was basically obsessed with this entire movie but the part that got me the most when i was like yes this is the feminist action movie i have been waiting my whole life for was when the one vuvalini was naked bait in the tower and yet you never saw any gratuitous nudity even in this part that had nudity that was actually useful to the story line it was glorious i will be purchasing this movie the day it comes out and then rewatching it forever my mom dragged me almost literally to see this and not knowing anything about it i hated the first five minutes as soon as charlize theron showed up passed the bechdel test and kicked ass it won me over i gushed the whole way home  saw this movie with a fellow feminist we were literally surrounded by men in the movie theatre this movie was so kickass and loved that the leading woman was disabled also a lot of ppl have said furiosa is queer is that cannon or more just they never mentioned it so we can read it as we want there was defs a lack of people of colour in the movie which is super not okay i like that mad max was basically not necessary to the movie and how furiosa was leading this women but in a empowering ill help you if you want vs savioury way i liked that there was a fair few disabled folks in the movie i still cant believe that this movie has actually been made if there was ever a list of things hollywood executives dont want to have in their movies i think mad max has almost all of them this movie wasnt originally on my radar at all but people all over the internet okay really just cleolinda and noelle stevenson and now you guys have been telling me how good it is im so close to the end of this semester one takehome final and one lab writeup to go and have made my partner promise that well see this as soon as all my work is in are there any sexual assault scenes in this movie im seeing it in a couple of days and im trying to figure out if its gonna be too full on i think this response may be too late but no there werent i think the article above mentions this but its fantastic that a

girls took it to the patriarchy down with the patriarchy excellent movie yea its not perfect but its on the right path i wanted more women of color and i wanted the wives to have more lines but the movie did deliver on major fronts i was so so happy mad max and furiosa didnt kiss a romance would have been so absurd and infuriating given the circumstance you know wats funny when the naked bait lady climbed down and all the vuvalini approached the rig and the bait lady pulled furiosas head to hers i literally thought hell yea theyre gonna kiss im so here for this lol but either way im fine with it some people were complaining that the wives were nothing but objects in this film precious cargo if you will like i said maybe a few more lines of dialogue wouldve shown us more personality i wish there was furiosa merchandise like any marvel character lol i didnt think id like a 2 hour carchaseandthingsblowup movie but i was strangely invested when i got home my arms were sore cause i was clenching my fists the entire time without realizing it laura i totally second the wait that is tony from skins sentiment we just started watching that show and we were confused as to why douchebag tony was everywhere in our lives stop it tony  anyway i normally dont love the genre but i enjoyed this movie for many of the reasons already mentioned strong women characters holding their own it passes the bechdel test it doesnt exploit depictions of sexual violence i still didnt know any of the wives names though and i couldnt watch any of the vulvani getting hurt noooo just let her plant those seeds in peace yall but how in the hell is zoë kravitz the sole black person in this future earth am i to infer that when hell broke loose the people of color were the first to go thats pretty much exactly how i inferred it especially since some of the earliest scenes of the film included forced head shaving forced tattooing and an eerie salute plus neonazis are all about their norse mythology so when everyone started shouting about valhalla the white supremacy behind this nondescript society seemed pretty clear i also found it historically appropriate that the only black character had been cast as a sex slave since slavery is wrought with a history of rape for the purpose of producing more slaves these points gave me a lot of ecofeminist feels which were especially compounded by the mothers milk scene im transitioning back to a vegetarian diet this week as a result
Jul 28 2021,positive, enlargepeter opaskarars technica turns 21 at the end of this year but film coverage on site cant exactly purchase synthehol at the liquor store yet quietly weve been reviewing movies on the internet for 11 years nowa bakers dozen years if reviews of 3d experiences countstarting with this max payne piece that certainly qualifies as criticism but beginning in 2014 we made film a regular topic on site and these days we annually bounce from sxsw to fantastic fest with plenty of regional film events in between now this aint variety and we do not write about everything though we have covered beauty and the beast and the jungle book somehow but ars has quite a few highlights in the 2010s beyond just starting a dedicated culture section we failed at vulcan salutes with jake gyllenhall and ryan reynolds we caught the premiere of a academy awardnominated movie at nasas johnson space center somehow we even helped save a star warsadjacent movie from obscurity earning an imdb credit and inspiring a fulllength remake in the process  ars decade in review the 2010s  no foolinthe 2010s were a crazy decade for tech the 2010s  decade of the exoplanet the 2010s were a veritable golden age of opening credits in television after an amazing decade in space these are humanitys top achievements why the 2010s were the facebook decade  view more stories  so with the end of the decade rapidly approaching we felt it was ok to indulge our film listmaking impulses this is not necessarily a best films of the decade listundeniably great things like lady bird moonlight the master bridesmaids et al are fantastic films that do not really fall within our narrow wheelhouse of science technology and genre fare it is not a list of the most important films either as this decade of streamings rise female directors taking the reins continued globalization of cinema and a golden era for documentaries can likely be better explained elsewhere in the cinemacentric press but the following is definitely a list of the stuff from the last decade that continues to come up in conversation around the orbital hq years later and presumably these films will be forever fixtures of our streaming queues going forward its probably not a coincidence that during a decade when the most important and impactful technological change may prove to be the rise of the private space industry audiences were treated to a renaissance of space cinema too it turns out a great space movie does not have to involve intergalactic war or precise period piece drama though we all underrated first man folks if you want utter spectacle in the most realistic way possible alfonso cuaróns gravity may have been the intheater experience of the decade the vastness of space has never been more vivid even if some of the details may have irked our resident space purists the matt damonled the martian somehow made the intricacies of growing crops in space exciting continuing the trend of excellent science fiction that leaned heavily into the science no one knew linguistics was this fascinating back in 2016 but arrival just might be the overall best movie of the decade with the way it cleverly examines what we believe while simultaneously delivering a tense gripping scifi story and hidden figures puts the familiar periodpiece lens on an overlooked part of space history without glossing over the ugly bits while still feeling hopeful for what science and technology can achieve when the best and brightest can participate add any number of other fine space movies to this lotinterstellar ad astra etcbut this quartet revived a cinematic subset ars will always have a fondness for the 2010s will undeniably go down as the decade of superheroes by no means did it start here the nolan batman trilogy began in the 2000s as did the mcu with iron man in 2008 but it became an expanded universe cinematic event these last 10 years the first avengers hit in 2012 and box offices havent looked back since picking favorites among the standard superhero fare feels impossible your preferences of memorable spiderman into the spiderverse ironman iron man 2 captain america winter soldier or other regulation superhero flicks ragnarok eversoslightly over the original deadpool may just depend on which hero your childhood allegiances line up toward the true superteam event releases marked something slightly different and spectacular avengers end game over the original guardians by a hair but the caped crusades well remember a decade or two from now all busted out of the familiar formula to some degree black panther showed not only was there audience appetite for a bigbudget black superhero flick but there was appetite for one that grappled with modern societal challenges like isolationism oppression and technological disparity logan took a hero long familiar to filmgoers and turned the tropes of a superhero film into a western that comments on universal themes like aging and the human condition in the process and while wonder woman may be the most straightforward superheroy of the three it showed a femaleled comic book conquest was worth doing especially when it leveraged wellexecuted periodpiece elements with delightful sidekick chemistry for the future of the thenbeleaguered dc comics entertainment arm wonder woman also proved everything didnt have to be dark and brooding in order to reach an audience all the fun being had in hbos watchmen seems to indicate dc took the hint and ok its not a traditional superhero movie but we couldnt make an ofthedecade film list and exclude mad max fury road entirely like more traditional capedcrusader flicks this is an existing ip with an established hero that got a reimagining decades after the original it starts with a very super villainy evil plot our titular hero is being sucked for blood to heal the badteam war boys another hero has to help a group of women known as the five wives escape forced procreations the film also offers extremely satisfying set pieces and action plus ultimately some reveals that change how we previously understood our main character finally perhaps most like the trio above this newest mad max film took a decidedly different approach to its familiar postapocalyptic world max rockatansky may be back invigorated by tom hardy but the star of the show is imperator furiosa charlize theron the postapocalyptic female hero scifi action fans deserve
Mar 29 2021,positive, it almost goes without saying and yet we should say it more often that being a cinephile is a bit of an ironic designation anyone who loves cinema or even television which is just as cinematic is a cinephile that being said there are still plenty of films whose names are thrown around under illustrious categories such as canon and classic were going to take a look at films within and beyond these to create the beginnings of our very own alternate canon clout films this is not to say in any way that these arent fantastic films what separates them from other fantastic films is that today they have  or should have  just as much clout as anything from your usual canon your gone with the winds  sunset boulevards and citizen kanes a lot of these films have also been included in alternate canons but are far too often expected to just stay there the ultimate triviality of this clout is what makes it so potent in influencing conversations about film and what calls us to redefine it  a moving gentle film that any fan of cinema or filmmaker will surely fall in love with the film is a documentary directed by singapore born filmmaker sandi tan about an independent film she made when she was just 19 the less you know about this film the better but do be prepared for the story to go to unexpected places the film is nostalgic vulnerable and personal and in being so makes you attach yourself to it like almost nothing else  gary grays 1996 crime film featuring queen latifah vivica a fox and jada pinkett smith used the heist genre to tell complex innercity stories of black women the friendsturnedbankrobbers are compelling detailed characters and the films freshness carries it past any missteps  this blackandwhite fantasy drama film from iceland happens to be the debut of genrebending experimental pop music artist björk and whilst that is enough of a hook for many especially considering her wonderful performance the last thing this film should be remembered as is trivia written and directed by nietzchka keene based on the fairy tale the juniper tree collected by the brothers grimm this small production tells the story of two sisters in a medieval setting who are forced to escape their home  brilliantly animated highly acclaimed and an innovative adaptation persepolis a comingofage story set against the iranion revolution is a gripping feminist tale codirector marjane satrapi author of the graphic novel the film is based on chooses to style her autobiographical narrative as if the source material itself had come to life leaving us with a breathtaking piece of cinema  seijun suzuki prominent bfilm director channels all his quirks and influences with cool effectiveness into this gem of a yakuza film the story follows a reformed hitman who is forced to wander around japan to escape being killed by various gangs a unique and significant voice in the history of cinema that deserves much more love one might not expect an adaptation of jane austens emma to be just so pop clueless is exuberant funny loving and delights in the possibilities of its title the film is very much a time capsule of a very particular 1990s america and writerdirector amy heckerling makes a romcom thats hard not to like what makes the film truly special is its commitment to characters that it both ridicules and celebrates ultimately embodying a confidence that very few other films have a landmark in the queer film canon cheryl dunyes romcom drama is a heavily selfreflexive lively and dizzyingly charismatic along with being the films writer director and editor dunye also plays the protagonist  named cheryl  and owns every moment on screen  its a special film and you wont regret giving it a watch a poignant childrens film which injected american animation with a surge of energy style and confidence the lego movie took the most surprising stances and went in the most surprising direction charming characters voiced by a talented cast of fan favourites like chris pratt will ferrell elizabeth banks alison brie will arnett chris offerman liam nesson and morgan freeman are just a bonus albeit a big one chaitanya tamhanes directorial feature debut which he wrote too proved to be a silent observational and devastating film the multilingual legal drama dances between the real and the absurd using the spaces between them

of the most important african films but one of the most important films ever anand gandhis art film told through three stories that explore the paradox of the same title as the film interprets the question on several levels relating it to humanity and the nature of being its a delicate powerful film that belongs up there george miller at age 71 returned to deliver another instalment of his iconic mad max franchise and ended up doing something weve never seen before the film despite being a soft reboot turned out to be one of the greatest action films of all time with many trying to praise it by calling it an art action film and the film was not short of praise it won 6 awards at the 88th academy awards despite all the buzz everyone knew it would never win best picture this remarkable film led by an instantly iconic charlize theron with tom hardys titular character taking a backseat almost sounds too simple on paper youll have to watch it to see how it took us to new heights of energetic ambitious emotionally resonant intelligent exhilarating and political filmmaking situated in the broad japanese new wave movement toshio matsumotos nonlinear film about a young trans woman is an experimental look at queer culture in 1960s tokyo the striking originality of the films voice which dips into documentary as and when it feels like produces an absolutely captivating experience it might be hard to watch at times but if you can you should though possession has developed a massive cult following and is a highly regarded horror film andrzej żuławskis psychological drama about a wife who asks her husband for a divorce  an intentionally reductive description  is disturbing enchanting thrilling and opens itself up to multiple readings whilst it doesnt have to be viewed as anything more than an engaging piece of work many continue to view it as only a genre film with the typical condescension towards genre films attached if you have a bug for horror give it a go whilst this might have been a surprising pick a decade ago recent critical reevaluation has shone a light on this classic teen horror film now viewing it as us fans always  have the film written by academy award winner diablo cody best original screenplay for juno directed by karyn kusama starred megan fox and amanda seyfried and one cant help but suspect that the general public was ready to dismiss it before it came out it was marketed with the most heteronormative male gaze possible which cody has spoken out about later an example would be how the kissing scene between the leads was heavily pushed to appeal to adolescent boys this scene actually embodied some of the best themes of the film confusion between friendship and love the relationship between desire and fear and bold feminist strides all of this was wrapped up in a fun tense and poignant story often touted as the spiritual successor to the iconic cult film the rocky horror picture show this film carved its own niche cult following largely thanks to writerdirectorstar john mitchell he plays hedwig a genderqueer east german rock singer and their backing band the angry inch its a lovable film with plenty of personality humour and heart a masterpiece of hindi cinema dibakar banerjees anthology film started the 2010s off with a bang its an original story coming from an original voice the subject matter itself  including honour killings nonconsensual recording and selling of sex tapes and sting operations  makes the fact that this film even exists a little bit of a miracle fun fact this was also rajkummar raos film debut anurag kashyap cemented his name in the history of hindi cinema with this 5 hour long multigenerational family revenge saga it breathes with the ferocity and depth of a classic like the godfather or a more recent film like gangs of new york but tells its own very singular story darkly comic brutal and impactful the film also features one of the greatest casts seen in a hindi film manoj bajpayee richa chadha nawazuddin siddiqui piyush mishra pankaj tripathi reema sen huma qureshi rajkummar rao and many many more amongst the many studio ghibli classics isao

thematically heavy and looking absolutely marvelous go in blank let it unfold to be perfectly honest one could make the case for most of charlie kaufmans filmography  as either writer or director

duh customer service experts onenight stay at a hotel the film features just three voices david thewlis as michael tom noonan as the voice michael hears out of everybody else in the film and jennifer

Dec 4 2020,positive, hile much of the minimalist plot bears resemblance to his earlier mad max films george millers fury road is less remake and more reinvention of his own postapocalyptic action movie genre blending elements of the road warrior and mad max beyond thunderdome the visionary director dials up the sunscorched atmosphere to a deafening degree  rusty behemoths collide with damaged flesh and punishingly hostile terrain while heavy metal guitar chords and booming drums bang out a rhythmic dirge both the pacing and intensity are relentless with only snippets of humor thrust into the scanty dialogue yet miller knows exactly how much chaos to douse upon his wildly inventive action sequences without losing the quirky fun the gorgeously demonic designs appear freshly unhinged while still retaining an air of nostalgia as the everescalating demolition of man machine and mise en scene prove endlessly entertaining in this lovingly demented ode to mayhem haunted by the ghosts of those he couldnt save max rockatansky tom hardy wanders the savage wastelands of a world crumbling under the weight of misery despair and diabolical despots preying upon the weak captured and assigned as sustenance aka a blood bag for the unhealthy minions of vicious tyrant immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne max spies an opportunity to escape his cruel fate when he encounters the resolute driver imperator furiosa charlize theron fleeing from joes citadel city with the mad kings precious cargo and a massive war rig tanker furiosa enlists maxs help to traverse hundreds of miles of barren desert in a perilous mission of redemption expectedly it all begins with a car chase then it segues into a pursuit on foot before giving way to yet another race of vehicles its no secret that mad max fury road is essentially a twohour car chase but credit is due to writerdirector george miller for taking his one idea and attacking it with such unwavering energy that the movie can survive on basically nothing else the filmmaker certainly knows how to do fast and furious if ever there were a film that deserved those words in its title its this and yet though the project is named after max its really therons furiosa who owns the film bringing a more sympathetic humanistic character into the fold especially considering that rockatansky barely has any lines of dialogue miller realizing that fans crave more of what he gave them in mad max 2 the road warrior reimagines many of the same elements but with far more verve miraculously he pays homage or grandly embellishes more often than he merely rips off his former concepts  which of course he would be entitled to do since he practically invented the postapocalyptic wasteland setting and epic vehicular skirmishes with cannibalized reoutfitted hodgepodge conveyances motorcycles big rigs monster trucks tanks and more are gloriously welded and melded together into gargantuan juggernauts of metal and fuel this eyepopping style carries over with equal eccentricity to the costuming makeup and prosthetics manifesting some splendidly fitting grotesqueries and oddities and villains  as audiences have come to anticipate from millers works the denizens become ever stranger as the locations shift and the picture progresses like a twist on birdmans percussionist who regularly appeared in shots with the actors as his beats permeated the soundtrack miller employs literal drummers and an electric guitarist perched atop  or rather dangling from  one of the trucks to supplement the background sounds with thunderous thumps and twanging riffs respectively it ramps up the momentum if such a thing is possible for the colossal action sequences that assault the viewer with such force that the 120minute runtime feel like 30 so much stuff goes on in every frame except perhaps for a plot that its unachievable to take it all in the first time through the stunts are likely the only piece of the film that could be better appreciated unfortunately thanks to the extreme advancements in computer graphics its been over three decades since the road warrior its no longer necessary to choreograph exacting realism from such scenes before there was something undeniably aweinspiring about the stuntmen getting thrown from cars and careening about in the dirt since every moment involved actual humans but now cg bodies and vehicles frequently replace real and realistic stunts allowing for gravitydefying and farfetched maneuvers that lose a bit of their impressiveness in their sheer outlandishness though practical effects do make up a large percentage of the screen still the calm before the storm of a finale is utterly exhilarating as highoctane recklessness and physical abandon replace sensibility and cinematic caution  its an absolute thrill ride designed by mike massie   20062024 gone with the twins  all movie related images  their respective owners articles on this site may not be distributed or reproduced without written consent
Nov 20 2020,positive, i certainly was looking forward to the release of this movie  and was in desperate need for some chill time at the cinemas it was well deserved  mad max surely isnt that popular as i thought it would be considering that i shared the cinema hall with just about eight other people maybe because there wasnt much hype or fuss about it here in ghana nonetheless i would doubt if anyone who has seen the prerelease trailers would dare say i am not interested in watching this movie trust me those teaser trailers were enough to grab my attention months ago mad max  fury road is a futuristic apocalyptic story set in a stark desert landscape where humanity is broken and almost everyone is crazed fighting for the simple necessities of life following the story of two rebels on the run who just might be able to help restore order theres max who seeks peace of mind following the loss of his wife and child in the aftermath of the chaos and furiosa a strong willed woman trying to find her way back to her childhood homeland tom hardy beat jeremy renner and host of likable stars to land this lead role as max alongside charlize theron furiosa nicolas hoult and hugh keaysbyrn its easier for me to understand why this movie is a big deal because i have seen the earlier titles so i kind of see the need for this reboot and that gives me more appreciation for this movie for starters unlike most apocalyptic movies you might have seen instead of the usual dry dusty deserts this one has a lot of color and depth the directors did well to capture certain level of beauty in a dry waste land i loved every bit of the cinematography compared to the previous movies you immediately feel the midas touch of technology in the making of this movie for the story line itself i would describe it as high octane full throttle action packed and chaotic yes right from the start to the very end the entire story line keeps an action sequence that doesnt slow down or dull you enough to change the vibe of the movie the chaotic madness can in no way be classified as humorous at all if you are thinking of going to laugh at this movie expecting some madness that would crack you up  forget it its all seriousness with a lot of explosions and daring stunts insane action that would literally blow you away and have you at the edge of you seat for the entire run time  this is a huge step up from the earlier movies exactly what it was meant to beequally chaotic and horrific yet more intense and breathtakingly exciting in fact at some point it becomes even difficult to keep up with the thrill and you cant afford to blink all for the fear for losing sight of any of the action oh there is also the hard rock fused score that just keeps your pulse rushing with adrenaline if there is anything else that i love next to movies it would be rock music and or waakye  lol  although its cold violent and visceral you can also feel the underlying elements of hope loyalty reverence and redemption  i am confident to say all those trailers and featurettes did promise and deliver for me besides the almost unnoticeable holes in the actual plot and backdrop of the movie there also wasnt too much dialogue in the story line especially for the max character i feel this was all part of the makers attempt at making him seem darker confused and mysterious i guess it worked even though i didnt like that at some point i felt i like the movie should have been titled mad furiosa instead  i was also expecting that the reboot would have started from before the apocalypse era like the first mad max 1979 movie did maybe the makers would consider doing that as this revamped franchise kicks off and progresses my only fear is that some people might get lost in all the chaos and confusion and may not give this title the appreciation it fully deserves its always refreshing for me to watch a movie as thrilling and entertaining as this was especially one that has come back from thirty years  i am now more interested in seeing how the follow up sequels do as well this is certainly time well spent my chill time wasnt wasted at all going to see this movie and i cant wait to see it again i am scoring this  810 max rockatansky narrating my name is max my world is reduced to a single instinct survive as the world fell it was hard to know who was more crazy me or everyone else second on my list of addictions is movies the only thing i could possibly love more is my dearest waakye lol nothing else does a better job of reminding me that anything is possible with the right amount of effort i have great eye for details and flaws in scripts shallow scripts bore me i am an avid reader    your everyday mr nice guy always the last to speak in a room full of smart people half human half martian but full movie freak

Oct 21 2020,positive, every so often and in increasingly rare numbers a big budget hollywood extravaganza comes along and negates the crushing conditioned cynicism built into our cinematic receptors walking into a franchise reboot of a series that hasnt received fresh blood in nearly three decades following a trilogy of films having starred an infamously fallen matinee idol forecasts were dubious at best for george millers mad max fury road premiering out of competition at cannes just prior to receiving its worldwide premiere the seventy year old originator of the iconic series defied all expectations to create a beautiful and intense action film standing as one of the best sequels to arrive in well over a decade stuffed with innovative visuals bloody violence insanely choreographed car chases and serving a rudimentary feminist allegory coursing through the usual arid bromide of commonly testosterone laced genre the film is unforgettable testament to the heights such cinema can still attain max tom hardy becomes the unwilling prisoner of immortan joes hugh keaysbyrne a ruthless leader of one of mankinds few surviving human populations following the apocalypse hoarding water inside his mountainside kingdom but one of joes trusted leaders the ferocious imperator furiosa charlize theron has just stolen a war tanker and with it joes bevy of buxom breeder women hes kept locked in a cave for pleasure and progeny thrust into the band of crusaders out to capture furiosa and return the human loot max understands his only chance of survival is to band with furiosa much has been made of the films significant presence as a feminist action film considering miller reportedly consulted with eve ensler concerning the characterizations of women its impressive editing from millers wife margaret sixel who also worked on millers features babe pig in the city and happy feet and its showcasing of actor charlize theron whose narrative dominates the film as she relegates its eponymous hero into the position usually reserved for a damsel in distress as imperator furiosa theron successfully launches herself in the dusty footsteps of sigourney weaver and linda hamilton women action stars successfully crafted without adhering to fantastical notions dictated by the male gaze the whole narrative thrust is the aggressive action a band of women takes in reclaiming their rights over their own bodies creating a ripple effect of metaphoric interpretations for the continuation of mankind in the films postapocalyptic universe the cadre of sexworkerbreeders tend to be represent the films wobblier moments of characterization miller makes impressive use of pouty beauties like rosie huntingtonwhiteley and riley keough but zoe kravitz cant quite manage to chew on her pulpy dialogue in quite the same fashion tom hardy is a winning ascension to the throne of max here given the last name officially of rockatansky though those unfamiliar with the earlier trio of mel gibson films learn little of him except hes lost his family to the cruel circumstances of a notsobrave dangerous new world in essence mad max fury road is a bombastic breathless two hour chase sequence miller innovatively spins a furious environment filled with disgustingly realized villains as the memorable leader immorten joe played by hugh keasbyrne who was also a villain in mad max given the budget and creative control to fashion his craft without studio interference this is exactly the type of grand cinematic spectacle brimming with passionate zealous ideas thats been sorely lacking from the mechanical operations of formulaic tent poles warner bros presents their hot property in high definition 241 the booming soundtrack part of the films matchless experience is in 51 dolby digital though some of the immersive qualities are obviously not comparable to seeing the film theatrically and as one of the more arguably appropriate releases using 3d technology miller coaxed dop john

Jul 17 2020,positive, mad max fury road is set in a post apocalyptic future where humanity has lost hope and people fight for the basic necessities of life under the rule of immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne  two rebels in the form of max rockatansky tom hardy and imperator furiosa charlize theron lead the fightback for hope and order in a world turned mad my friend asked me how i was going to write this up as a review  i replied i need a couple of days to let that sink in so i can form words mad max fury road is exactly what it needed to be  the pace is relentless  as soon as the film begins youre projected into the high octane world of the wastelands the plot is wafer thin with minimum dialogue playing out like a silent movie surrounded by carnage  in any other film this would have been a massive criticism but this film gets away with it for good measure and reasons  it lives in the moment not dwelling on the backstory of how the world came to be or maxs past  it keeps things refreshingly simple everything about this film represents why i love going to the cinema  its a feeling i havent lost since i was a child  visiting a cinema can be a magical experience where a film can transport you to another world where the impossible is possible  mad max fury road has that in abundance  visually it presents to you an old school nostalgia a time where practical effects ruled over computer generated effects  before i open the debate there is nothing wrong with computer generated effects  done correctly and it enhances the film  done badly and it will appear fake and cartoonish  if i had to put a percentage on this film 90 of mad max was done practically  in todays modern hollywood where every film is interwoven and connected with shared universes its unheard of and it plays in the films benefit there are some crazy mindblowing stunts where youll wonder how it was achieved and it adds to the intense realism  every collision or crash on screen you dont doubt it you believe it  you feel it  in a post apocalyptic world forget formula 1 and their drs or fast and furious and their turbonitro charges  in a mad max world its just you your guts your guile and the machine you drive in  its a driving film in its purest form  if fast and furious 7 is like watching top gear on steroids then mad max fury road is like watching top gear on every conceivable drug known to mankind the action is beautifully and bravely choreographed  just like dredd or the raid where the action is no holds barred each action sequence performs like a domino effect dance where one thing leads to another and another gradually building up to the spectacle such as the sand storm  the whole thing is brutally chaotic and at times comedic but you cant stop watching  im glad the film had some fade to blacks moments or the audience would just stop breathing cars are a sign of power and the bigger it is the more significant you are  nothing goes to waste as each vehicle is a metal rusting mashup with another vehicle creating a new beast altogether the cars are also worshipped especially for the war boys  they proudly hold their steering wheels in the air as they head for battle  they make a symbolic hand gesture to cement their commitment to their leader and their trip to valhalla a heaven where they can live forever after dying in glorious death but the cult is feeble which nux nicholas hoult questions during the course of the film  the war boys endlessly sacrifice themselves kamikaze style for a leader with his own corrupt game  because nux doesnt get the ending he desires the principles of the faith start to crumble when its put under scrutiny its a society that is broken with humanity on its last knees  immortan joe and his war boys are at the top of the pyramid and the rest are dependant on their services  joe hoards water and food in the citadel to keep people desperate because the needs of humanity gives him the power to do what he wants hence his line about resenting its absence if the people became addicted to water but its also a world that is sick and toxic  the war boys are seen with nasal cannulas  immortan joes face mask doubles up as a breathing mask  his broken body is assembled together with body kit like darth vader  nux has cancerous tumours on his shoulders and has nicknames for them alliances also play their part especially in the long chase and hunt for the escapees  joe has dealings with gas town for petrol and bullet town ammunitions to keep up their ongoing pace but i dont look at mad max fury road having a feminist agenda  i see it as a film about liberation to break free of oppression and rule  a classic scifi ideology tom hardys performance as max is different from his predecessor mel gibson  whether youre familiar with the mad max story or not this new interpretation and his struggles are more subtle and internal than spoken  his performance is more physical  when hes captured against his will he becomes a blood bag for the war boys  all max wants to do is find peace in the new world but with a man with nothing to lose he can succumb to the madness in order to survive  this is perfectly illustrated in one brilliant scene where he simply walks off into the desert only to return moments later with a blanket full of guns and blood all over his face but the outstanding performance goes to charlize theron as furiosa  she defies her master in order to escape his rule and takes his breeder wives along for the ride  she seeks redemption and wants to return home  in the quieter moments of the film she provides the emotional heart especially when she discovers what happened to her home mad max fury road should be celebrated for its strong role reversal  furiosa is the lead in this film but there is a definite balance between max and furiosa and their shared empathy  they are equals looking for the same thing and that quality separates them from the animals  furiosa is not a sidekick or a damsel in distress  she can take care of her own without conforming to a stereotype theron delivers the most complete well rounded and realistic character since ripley was first introduced in alien  it also puts an end to the myth that female characters cant hold their own in a big budget movie  its a positive representation of women being survivors at the end of the world  thats definitely not a negative or a criticism or in some circles why the film should be boycotted  its a refreshing change from what we normally expect out of a summer blockbuster film the film may be simple in its premise but it has enough intelligence without spoon feeding information  the characters accept the world they live in and so does the audience films like mad max fury road do not come along often  director george miller delivers an epic and visual cinema art film that celebrates survival and hope in a bleak and deranged universe if you can see it again try an imax screening trust me you wont regret it favourite moments from the film the flame throwing guitar man sticks out
Jul 5 2020,positive,walltowall visceral action insane practical stunts highly stylized production with a thoughtful take on the apocalypse
Jul 3 2020,positive, while talking to a friend recently i happened to mention how i was more excited about the new mad max than i was for a new star wars he was surprised by that i told him that while i will always be a huge star wars fan i still have some residual disappointment over the prequels over the past 35 years on the other hand mad max has never let me down now that fury road has arrived i have been lifted to a whole new level of excitement adoration and respect postapocalyptic road warrior max rockatansky tom hardy has been captured by the war boys the whiteskinned radiationsickened minions of immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne immortan joe is the warlord of an area of towering cliffs known as the citadel where he controls his people with small rations of what he calls aqua cola clean water he pumps up from underground max being a universal blood donor makes him very valuable as a blood bag to help reinvigorate any war boys who are feeling the effects of their sickness on this day immortan joe is sending an armored semi called a war rig to the neighboring gas town and the bullet farm to trade water for the respective supplies their names suggest the driver imperator furiosa charlize theron has other plans for the rig she has helped immortan joes 5 breeder wives escape and is taking them to her old home the green place immortan joe gathers a posse of war boys to chase after furiosa one of his drivers nux nicholas hoult is hooked up to the max blood bag since he still needs the strength maxs blood is providing but he refuses to give up the driver seat to anyone else he has max strapped to the front of his vehicle as he launches full throttle down the fury road fury road is the literal definition of controlled chaos its an amazing fulltilt assault on the senses this incarnation of max is truly mad seeing visions and hearing voices most specifically of his dead child his experiences on his own in the vast wasteland have shaped him into a crazy yet cautious man of few words but meaningful actions he is definitely out for himself but not so selfcentered that he cant recognize strength in others to this end max really isnt the main character furiosa is just like in the road warrior max is more of a device something the other characters use to help them in their cause furiosa might have been able to achieve her goal without him but her chances improve dramatically with max along for the ride george miller has written and directed all of the mad max films while it has been 30 years since the last entry beyond thunderdome miller tackles fury road like it has only been two or three you get the impression that over the past three decades he has written down every random mad maxstyle stunt piece that has come to his mind and he has put every single one of them into this film under normal circumstances that could make a movie feel bloated but not in millers capable hands even more amazing than the stunts is the fact that there is very little cgi work every wild vehicle usually amalgams of several different kinds actually works and are really flying across the desert its such a glorious sight so glorious in fact that i highly recommend shelling out the extra dough and seeing this in 3d i dont normally do this knowing that people have so many different opinions about the technology but this is probably the first film in this new era of digital 3d that is worthy of the gimmick or rather the gimmick is worthy of the film miller uses 3d the way it was conceived to be used with several gags that made me flinch as car chunks and bodies flew toward me he even rewards us with a fun traditional gag a kind of throwback throwforward one right at the climax fury road isnt all fury though there is a strong story under all the mayhem furiosa is a very deep and flawed character maybe even a little more than max theres a moment when her story is revealed that actually got me a touch choked up which is more testament to the directing talents of george miller this is the man who also gave us babe after all i can go on and on but it would all basically boil down this one truth mad max fury road is the most brilliant piece of mayhem to ever hit the screen period hearst television participates in various affiliate marketing programs which means we may get paid commissions on editorially chosen products purchased through our links to retailer sites
Apr 28 2020,positive,this movie was just bonkers
Apr 28 2020,positive,it was great i mean this is how to do an action movie
Apr 9 2020,positive,mad max fury road will be the film to beat for a long time coming and the new highwater mark against which to judge action and blockbuster filmmaking this is quite simply how its done
Jan 10 2020,positive,its a rare film that engages the mind while rocking the body millers vision of a world consumed by its own greed where water gasoline and bullets are the most precious commodities seems even more relevant today than it did 30 years ago
Dec 3 2019,positive, it grabs you from its frenetic opening scene sinking its teeth into your neck wrapping its pulsating tendrils around your heart stealing your breath and gripping your balls in a vicelike grasp  if you have balls that is mad max fury road is a cacophony of beautiful violence a turbocharged chase scene that plays out over two glorious hours as close to riding a rollercoaster you can experience while sitting in a movie theater yes i might sound like peter travers with this hyperbolic adulation but i cant help it this new mad max film just might be the best action film weve ever seen it will certainly be the one to beat in this summer season loaded with the usual suspects of sequels reboots and destruction porn how can i condemn destruction porn when fury road is more or less a nonstop orgy of explosions car wrecks and handtohand combat thats because unlike the marvel films currently polluting the multiplexes like stepford wives in their cookiecutter plots and safe scripts where death is temporary and destruction without human cost there is plenty at stake in fury road set in the same postapocalyptic world as the first three mad max films fury road features tom hardy stepping into the role made famous by mel gibson but unlike gibsons character hardys max actually seems legitimately insane its a fact we learn right away jack as he chews on a lizard and hallucinates about the people presumably family members he was unable to save unlike many reboots which give a hot young director a chance to fuck up a franchise fury road was written and directed by george miller the man whose name is attached to the previous three mad max films but if you look at millers recent credits you get two happy feet films and a babe sequel wtf who knew miller had such a virtuosic ballet of blood and ultraviolence left in him but heres the thing fury road is more than an exciting mindless bacchanal of gore and scorched earth when we first meet max he is captured and brought to a horrific citadel ruled by the masked warlord immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne where he is tortured branded and enslaved max is largely kept out of the action during the first third of the film bound in chains and used as a living blood transfusion for nux nicholas hoult one of immortan joes bald whiteskinned war boys a gang of twitchy psychos just waiting for their moment to go down in a blaze of glory see immortan joe is one evil dude who rules his kingdom by controlling the only water around but things are about to change with max under lock and key miller introduces us to imperator furiosa charlize theron a onearmed road warrior tasked by immortan joe to make a supply run to another settlement however furiosa has plans of her own and soon after she goes rogue immortan joe and his war boys create a flotilla of trucks and cars primed for battle and ready to blow the shit out of her ass who killed the world someone asks at the beginning of the film as furiosas mission becomes clear so does the answer to that question men the introduction of women characters is a stroke of genius here one that pushes fury road into the position of best film in the mad max series unlike the men broken or pushed into insanity by this new world order millers female characters express hope of a world reborn the symbolism may be obvious but it works fury road wouldnt have worked if it wasnt so damned beautiful miller along with writers nick lathouris and brendan mccarthy a comics artist mapped out the entire film in storyboard and makes a glorious leap to the screen nothing looks fake there is no shoddylooking cgi filling in the spaces this is a terrible world a place of vast deserts looming sandstorms and barren mountains there is something striking in its awfulness but unlike this broken world you will leave mad max fury road feeling invigorated squirming with life this is action filmmaking at its finest early water doesnt have much of an arc  after all its a rehearsal tape but it does have a surprisingly plentiful array of textures and transitions within its somewhat narrow parameters 
Oct 27 2019,positive, you hear every little speck of sand shaking loose from his body from his head downward every sound is intensified tenfold until hardys character stands tall and comes to his senses  for those unfamiliar with mad max fury road is the fourth installment in the george miller franchise which started in 1979 with mel gibson without too many spoilers in the original max rockatansky was a patrol officer in a dystopian australia before he lost everything of value to him his further adventures involve putting others lives ahead of his own the entirety is a delicious assault on both your visual cortex and auditory system  a giant orchestral blend of machine engines roaring and wheels peeling combined with a booming overture of drums and guitar  theres a short leg of the film where everyone is cast in a soft blue gradient its like watching the film under a filter and its beautiful                                                      staying true to the character hardys max doesnt say much  often speaking in grunts or with simple gestures  but he doesnt need to the smallest movement of his eyes or gestures do the talking most of the time hes a terrifying badass who eats lizards raw and can take down a pack of men singlehandedly without blinking an eye   both he and therons imperator furiosa one of many lavish names in the film are a ragged tagteam of warriors who you cant get enough of on screen  you know who im talking about if youve seen the trailers  the wild guitarist playing his own personal concert atop a spectacular macys day paradelike vehicle every time he comes on screen you cant help but grin because its so utterly over the top that its just another welcome addition to the mixed bag of eccentric characters on display one thing that may surprise you given the films testosteroneheavy marketing in trailers is that its driven by a femalecentric storyline going in with little expectations having only watched the first mad max i was ready for an allout bromovie filled with car chases brawls and mindless fun while you certainly get all of that you get a bit more too and its refreshingly welcome   while the movie clocks in at two hours it feels like it goes on for longer and its one of the rare times you wont think thats a bad thing imagine a gorgeously wild and hellish wacky races meets twisted metal replace the scary clown face from the popular game with maxs immortan joe numerous parties engage in combat  some hanging from wiry poles that would make cirque du soleil members jealous                                                    for the final 30 minutes or so i surrendered myself to the film dropping my pad and pen with which i usually jot down notes to claw nervously into my cheeks and the back of my neck awaiting the uncertain fate of our films protagonists over a majestic desert car battle 
Oct 21 2019,positive, when i bought my ticket to see mad max fury road i had never seen a single mad max movie in my life i knew it was an australian dystopian franchise from the 80s starring mel gibson and had a substantial cult following but not much else so when i eased into my seat i was pretty unprepared for the visual and thematic feast about to unfold before me like its predecessors fury road is set in a grim desert wasteland where water and oil are scarce pockets of surviving humans are desperate for resources and power and nobody has more of either than immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne things kick into high gear when furiosa charlize theron dark places a mysterious lieutenant in joes army is sent across the desert to fetch oil joe discovers that furiosa has broken his five wives free from their prison and stowed them in her oil rig max is thrown into the action when his captors engage in a massive desert chase against furiosa who is bound and determined to reach an oasis called the green place if max seems like a bit of a footnote here he is furiosa and the women are the heart and soul of fury road championing female life and autonomy into something that could have easily been a popcorn flick for bros when max joins the women on their rig initially selfpreservation is his only goal but these women two of whom are pregnant show him what it means to want survival  not only for yourself but for your children and a future world as well its not a perfect movie or one thats universally appealing nearly the whole twohours is a car chase which can be tiring if youre not into that sort of film tom hardy the revenant delivers a somewhat vague performance at times its not easy to engage with his character the action is continuous the roars loud and the explosions vivid but on the whole fury road impresses and surprises more than almost any other 2015 release as evidenced by its 6 oscar wins movie nerds especially will be thrilled to watch the energy and prowess of incredible stunt performers casual filmgoers will be delighted to see the tactile grit of real choreography and real explosions after a decade of shiny computergenerated stunts in almost every other action flick but mad max suffers from none of these rookie mistakes it truly knows how to show not tell we arent told why furiosa has a mechanical arm but we understand that shes a warrior who realised she wants to fight for life instead of slavery we dont need definitions of the terms valhalla or blood bag or the history of gas town and its relationship to the citadel were swept up in the chase the fights the conversations and were told just enough to keep us engrossed at the end of the night fury road offers us a wellmade tightlywritten critique of greed oppression and dehumanisation it may be a bumpy ride but its a ride like youve never taken before debbie is the communications and engagement lead for narrative muse and lives in brooklyn new york she loves movies creativity advocating for kindness excellent takeout yoga gifs getting rush tickets for broadway shows reading on the subway and working in her community garden narrative muse is audiencesupported when you buy books and movies through links on our site youre helping us stay in business because we may earn an affiliate commission

Aug 2 2019,positive, the last black man in san francisco i thought this would be a story of gentrification its sort of that but mostly something stranger and more haunting jimmie fails played by an actor of the same name who also cowrote with his childhood friend joe talbot is obsessed with the house he grew up in which has passed into the hands of a white couple with his best friend mont jonathan majors he visits the house and engages in guerrilla upkeep when the white couple breaks up and moves out they squat there as they try to figure out whether they can buy the house for real the house is gorgeous from its painted ceilings to its witchhat tower room and youll want these two guys to succeed in their comrade quixote questbut at a certain point you may notice that this is all about the ownership of stuff when the two friends begin to put their plan in motion the first thing we see is them walking down a flight of steps flanked by two columns of homeless people the hunger jimmie feels for specific highlysymbolic land and furniture begins to feel clutching unsettling misplaced and believe me the film will pay off on that tremor of doubt this is a film about two guys who have not succeeded by conventional standards they dont have wives or girlfriends they dont have kids they dont own the home theyre illegally sharing if you keep a running tally of the kinds of places poor people can live this movie will leave you with a doubledigit list sro group home abandoned house your car somebody elses car they do have one another and their friendship is portrayed with such sweetness at one point the camera draws an extremely unsubtle parallel between these two best friends and a straight couple this is the friendship of two artsy guys who feel alone in the world without city or community homeless except when theyre with each other and the fact that the final shots of the film show one of the friends rowing a boat out on the unresting waves of the pacific ocean and then rowing the boat offscreen so only the waves are left may suggest that this world doesnt let you keep what you salvage there are many many semisatirical moments in this highly theatrical film like the tourist party bus blasting somebody to love as it rolls past the naked guy waiting at the bus stop the portrayal of san franciscos cuckoo aspect helped me deal with the fact that the movies climax is an act of political theaternonconsensual audience participation maybe that is just how people in sf express emotions theres a lot in this movie which spoke to me especially in its unexpected twists and moments im not sure ive seen another film where the relationships which compete with the central friendship are not romantic relationships but relationships with your family of origin i loved the quiet nerdykid humility with which mont says when jimmie catches him drawing portraits of the dudes who just insulted him i shouldnt get to appreciate them cause theyre mean to me thats silly this is a movie about the search for a homethe inability to find it where you thought youd left it maybe the inability to find it at all theres a lot to say about the politics of gentrification but in this film gentrification is a synecdoche for a universal condition of exile mad max fury road on a very different note this kicked so okay id avoided this when it came out because i made the mistake of being on social media even a little and found the whole discourse of is this a good film because its feminist or is it a bad film because its feminist so dumb and depleting started to feel like the people who liked it only liked it because it wasnt something they resent not because it was something awesome its something awesome its all hot orange and brown the glamor of the punishing desert wind it is completely ott and it cant go five minutes without an explosion and i loved it the dialogue is often dumb in a way i dont enjoy but fortunately theres little dialogue overall one of my very favorite genres is batshit pleasureidiocy for the bad sweet tooth  genuine harrowing emotion and fury road is a classic of that vertiginous genre youll feel things youll respect these characters youll love them and want their hard world not to break their spirits and youll also get to cheer while they fight dudes on giant freaking bendy poles with flamethrowers its so good lots of just very smart choices in a movie which is also pure dumb pleasure the mistrust and violence between our two heroes max rockatansky and imperator furiosa because this movie loves its audience with a swooning surrendering love is a smart choice the fact that they meet an allwomens community but its neither secret dystopia nor pacifist earth mother solution to their problems is a smart choice the whole weird sad thing with nux is a smart choice the fact that the dictators army has a bard and its a dude strapped to a war truck with an electric guitar that shoots fire is sure okay it is a smart choice in general i pretty much loved all the people strapped to trucks its such an immediate visual symbol for helplessness and complicity and it makes the fights weird and unexpected the heart of this movie is a scene in which max gives freely what was taken from him by force its a genuinely beautiful hardearned portrayal of sacrifice as an assertion of ones humanity
Jul 30 2019,positive, i dont want to review mad max fury road i want to write love letters to it or draw it like one of those french girls if i could find the right keystroke combination this review would just be one long onomatopoetic recreation of the feral roar of approval bellowed from deep within my bosom as the credits rolled theyve called it a gamechanger a masterpiece and a work of genius but none of those capture the totality of what writerdirector george miller has done here it deserves some new term some unique series of letters fused together by explosions underneath a desert sun i dont know maxcellent there you go its maxcellent its been asked is this a sequel to the other mad max movies a prequel a remake shhh dont you worry your pretty head about that none you just keep your eyes on that extra fiery fire and characters with names like rictus erectus and toast the knowing the film is set some time in the future when earth is almost uninhabitable so given the senates recent denial that climate change is a thing at least 2016 lone wolf max tom hardy is grabbed by goons who serve immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne a decrepit and bloated monster who rules over a group of survivors the entirety of the plot is imperator furiosa charlize theron trying to escape with five of joes sex slave brides and maxs reluctant help thats it literally there is no more plot this isnt to say that the film isnt speaking volumes hell its not even speaking its shouting and screaming over a wailing guitar riff the brides scrawl graffiti in the dungeon they escaped reading we are not things and who killed the world riverbendgolfcomplexcom  the latter has a clear answer  dudes dudes killed the world unchecked masculinity killed civilization joes vile kingdom is the furthest point in testosteronefueled evolution men are solely bred for war women are disposable resources enter furiosa with one metal arm no hair and so much badass nobody else can have any furiosa is a human axe born to lop the head off the top of the patriarchy she is powerful without surrendering her desired femininity and one of the greatest action heroes ever miller pulled off one of the boldest funding stunts convincing the studio this was a mad max movie when max is window dressing in a leather jacket there simply to look cool fury road is violence as opera it is car chases as visual poetry the stunning physical and practical effects trump any and all computergenerated tomfoolery your eyes literally cant consume all thats happening flicking back and forth like nightmarefueled rem sleep millers magnum opus is proof a film can be fueled by meaningful social subtext and still kick ass its evidence that allout action need not be reduced to dumb fun its a reminder that computers can never will never be able to outadrenaline real stuntpeople doing real stunts its brilliant its glorious it is maxcellent
Jul 16 2019,neutral,fury road seems aimed at dudes who fetishize chrome and steel but miller plants seeds of bolder more incendiary ideas within the brofantasy
Jul 5 2019,positive,the sheer sustained energy of this thing is breathtaking and millers singular vision is a thing of brutal beauty
Jun 3 2019,negative, its a world gone mad in mad max fury road and director george miller wastes no time establishing the no holds barred kill or be killed state of living in his postapocalyptic vision a brief montage of sound clips outlining civilizations downfall plays before max rockatansky tom hardy shows up looking over a desert wasteland before fleeing in his car hes chased down and captured by a few war boys devout followers and henchmen of immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne joe is the cultlike leader of the citadel a desert city where he controls the oil water and food supply hes barely living with most of his body made up of machinery designed to keep him alive and he rules over his impoverished masses with no mercy just as max is taken prisoner joe sends out his war rig a massive truckwar machine to get gasoline from their supplier the truck is driven by imperator furiosa charlize theron whose shaved head and black war paint immediately establish her as someone not to be messed with she drives off but at a certain point makes an unexpected detour joe and his minions soon realize that furiosa has taken joes five young wives called breeders for reasons that should be obvious and his only chances at getting a male heir with her prompting joe to chase her down with everything hes got and with that mad max fury road starts its nearly two hour long car chase with furiosa and her five companions driving across the desert in the hopes of escaping joes fastapproaching army of cars and war boys max winds up tagging along with nux nicholas hoult a dying war boy hoping he can go out in a blaze of glory its hard not to see the onslaught of marketing for mad max fury road and believe that the film will represent some sort of transgressive alternative to the usual homogeneous pile of tentpoles unleashed every summer fury road only delivers on that promise to some degree the production design offers plenty of neat things to gawk at implying theres plenty more to this world than whats on screen and the minimal exposition is a breath of fresh air whats disappointing is how much of millers film feels familiar and formulaic its the same old story just dressed up in a spiky oversaturated outfit its not that miller is just copying and pasting another films plotim having a hard time thinking of any other movies where ghoulish men hunt down their leaders pregnant sex slaves the familiarity comes from the structure and story beats which emulate whats been done plenty of times before character development and themes boiled down to one word statements survival for max redemption for furiosa a romantic subplot with no bearing on anything a second act tragedy putting our protagonists success in doubt and a crazy last minute plan acting as a transition into the final act and climax and when your film literally moves down a straight line through a flat twocolour landscape a lack of variety will drag things down considerably action films with a simple onetrack mindset can be far from a bad thing both the raid redemption and dredd are great recent examples of the kiss principle in action but fury road never successfully establishes any stakes its easy to know where and how things will end up and for that reason its easy to detach from the onscreen spectacle theres a point in the climactic car chase where furiosa comes facetoface with joe and angrily says remember me its played as a cool kickass moment but i found it a strange thing to say considering this is the first time both characters actually share the screen together theres no weight or purpose to this moment but it falls in line with the expectations and structure of an action film so it has to be there that safeness that feeling of miller eccentrically colouring within the lines is fury roads downfall its a world gone mad but this film is anything but
May 10 2019,positive, its brutal wartorn world built on the liquid viscera of blood milk and oil is a dystopia but the future that max hardy and furiosa theron are fighting for feels gloriously utopian its not just the visuals  a fire and brimstone hellscape conjured by miller and dop john seale  that feel shockingly new but the films politics fury road is righteously emphatically feminist and it feels so so good this is what action filmmaking  hell all filmmaking  has been missing for so long therons thunderous performance leads the charge in this film that steals your breath and boils your blood what the cast and crew have achieved is rare and precious cherish it
Apr 26 2019,positive, when i saw the trailer for mad max fury road i was positive it would be one i couldnt see  i dont like violent films and it looked like a gory violent mess  however i always go through my process i describe for evaluating movie content in how to be mormon and like movies i look at reviews the detailed content summaries on screenitcom and i ask friends who have seen the movie  to my surprise i found it to have virtually no profanity and to not be as violent as i anticipated it is an r but most of that is more battle like violence some nudity and vehicular battles convinced it was within my comfort level i decided to go check it out  its a very tricky movie to review because it does what it is trying to do masterfully well i dont know how that can be debated  whether such a master work is your cup of tea is another question its certainly not a movie i will be frequently rewatching but i did think it was good and engaged me more than i would have guessed all in all it is a success and i can see why many people love it i have not seen the original mad max movies because i always figured they were too violent so perhaps i will give them a watch  this mad max doesnt have much of  plot its one action sequence after another  it does not try to have symbolism or a puzzle like a nolan film might have  it doesnt have a strong lead character like a bond film  the title is perhaps a misnomer because mad max has only a few lines of dialogue and is an ensemble player with charlize theron and others basically the plot that does exist starts out with setting  it is a desert postapocalyptic world that is ruled by a man named the immortan joe  max has been arrested and is forced to be a blood bag for a war boy played by nicholas hoult  charlize theron is furiosa who abducts 5 of joes wives called the breeders the rest of the movie is max furiosa and crew getting chased by joe and having intense battles with each other  each of the cars is so imaginative with one even being a giant speaker system with a guy playing an electric guitar  there are cars that have long poles for people to swing onto other cars  there are rigs with gasoline and others covered in spikes it keeps the action exciting because you dont know how the cars work and how the fight will play out for not speaking much tom hardy is good as mad max  but the movie doesnt give you a lot of time to contemplate his character  i cant even imagine how awful it must be to shoot a movie like this with all the dust and dirt but he is convincing as the stoic antihero the cg is kept to a minimum and it at least appears to have a lot of practical effects the stunt work is flawless  i wonder how much hardy and others did of their own stunts whatever the percentage is by professionals you definitely cant tell  it feels earthy and real which we havent seen in an action film in a long time i loved how mad max handled its female characters  it reminds me a little bit of emily blunt in edge of tomorrow  these are not cliched warrior women or damsels in distress  even the breeder women are relatively complex especially for this kind of movie   charlize theron is amazing she is tough but has heart and there is a moment that is completely devastating for her and she sells it there are different kind of women old women young women pregnant women and they all defy female tropes  the last thing i expected in a movie like this is an awesome group of women and it definitely helped sell me on the film hugh keaysbyrne is good as the villain immortan joe but most of that credit has to go to his costume and mask there is such attention to detail  the amount of time that must have been spent to get teeth right skin layered and dry lips cracked everything covered in dust is mind blowing  the makeup on the war boys including nicholas hoult is very convincing  they are brainwashed to believe if they are obedient servants to joe they will achieve immortality at the gates of heaven mad max fury road is not a movie that gives the audience much time to breathe  there is very little dialogue and i did feel kind of exhausted by the end of it but then again i feel like it was trying to do something completely different and new and from a comic book guy like george miller it makes sense it is primarily a visual spectacle  still it pushed me to my limit of apocalyptic car battle sequences who knew i had such a limit    im a little surprised it is so universally loved because i would think a few people might be bothered by the thin plot and lack of character development i guess they just accept it for what it is a new dazzling creative vision of what a war movie looks like  after all do we complain that the villains in a ww2 movie arent fleshed out enough do we want more dialogue in our john wayne war movie no  same with this  it is visually incredible and the action is immersive enough to carry the day like i said the women put it over the hump for me to a strong recommendation  it was such a pleasant surprise and i bet you could see the movie and not even notice most of the women  they are just characters in the movie like anybody else  it looks gorgeous  the action sequences are stunning and i was entertained as far as content it has some nudity from a distance and women are milked like cows in one brief shot  characters are stabbed impaled tortured and shot in the battle scenes  another you see briefly has his face ripped off from a mask a lot of crashes explosions and sand storms that are intense  a woman has a csection mostly off screen and an iv is seen being inserted  i know it sounds crazy but its actually more tame than you might think  no language  mostly it is a lot of cars and broad fighting like a battle than one on one violence like you might get in a horror movie also the music by a guy named junkie xl was outstanding with a great combination of electric guitar medal sounds and a traditional sweeping score oh well  cant make everyone happy  i liked that it really wasnt a girl power movie if it had been a bunch of cliched warrior women i would have hated that at least to me they were just normal characters doing awesome things  its not like there was some big moment where the movie wanted you to applaud the tough women  the action scenes are fast and nonstop and it just happens to be that a lot of the fighters are women  im amazed anyone would have a problem with that  so lame  i find it hard to believe men would really complain about the female characters i think the super feminists make that up in order to conjure up an adversary or something feminism is great but like everything in the world in moderation
Apr 16 2019,positive,   having seen the gobsmackingly overthetop trailers i went into mad max fury road worrying that it would be reviewproof and it is in that my review could consist of me pointing at the screen for 2 hours and going aaaaaaaaarrrrrggghhhhhthisisamaaaaaazzziiinnng   fury road jams the pedal to the metal and keeps its foot down for a breakneck 120 minutes of vehicular carnage a jawdroppingly beautifully painted demolition derby streaked through with humour as dry as the desert in which its set and hearts as black as the precious guzzleine that fuels it cracked lips and sandblasted faces leer from the ochre nightmare of a world fallen to rust flame blossoms from speeding war rigs twisted metal and bodies crash and tumble  the mayhem is viscerally exhilaratingly real making the glossy cgi heroics of  avengers age of ultron look like a saturday morning cartoon
Apr 8 2019,positive, chaos reigns in george millers mad max fury road 2015 his longawaited return to the world of his postapocalyptic ozplotiation franchise after a thirtyyear absence the budget and the actors may have changed but this is clearly the evolution of the filmmakers crazed vision arguably reaching the petrolsoaked valhalla that hes been striving for since the modest thrills of 1979s mad max its an injection of equal parts adrenaline and gasoline that tosses narrative out of the window and turns the action up to eleven a flamespewing guitarist is at the tip of a juggernaut at the vanguard of a fleet of spiked hellish vehicles that make up the rolling army of immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne the original films toecutter hes the aptly grotesque warlord who breathes through a skull facemask and keeps imprisoned a coterie of nubile breeding wives in the hope of a healthy heir his general imperator furiosa the hugely impressive charlize theron has turned cloak however commandeering one of his war rigs and liberating his wives immortan joe and his war boys including nicholas hoults nux give chase across the baking namib desert  replacing the arid expanse of the aussie outback  after the runaways who have fellow exprisoner max tom hardy riding shotgun far from being the setup that is effectively the entire plot for fury road is that rare thing an incredibly lean and gloriously overblown actioner the acrobatics lie not in storytelling or in theme but in the lurching crunch and twisted steel of highoctane vehicular mayhem and the flames oh the flames every pursuing wagon or war boy decked in tribal paint and cultish zeal that furiosa and max manage to stave off is sent flipping and burning into the sand in spectacular fashion nothing is too much and whilst there is the danger that some will find the unremitting havoc tiresome millers endless innovation keeps things fresh despite the surrounding wasteland maxs position as bystander foregrounding therons kickass heroine also feels like a cool breeze in the stifling landscape it may not a unanimous home run  there are still lingering shots of joes scantilyclad harem for eye candy  but its certainly hurtling in the right direction with closecropped hair and painted with oil theron is the beating heart of the film and furiosas character provides the picture with its less literal momentum hardy plays max with typical toughguy impassivity grunting his way through the vast majority of the proceedings there are no witty oneliners  in fact one could almost compare it to a silent film were it not so deafeningly loud but that is ultimately what fury road is all about sound and fury at 100 mph and its one hell of a ride
Mar 10 2019,positive,in mad max fury road the strong female characters are notable specifically for their aversion to violence

Jan 23 2019,positive, the restart  saying reboot would be a disservice to the films creativity  of the 19791985 trilogy that featured a cinematic journey to the postapocalyptic lunatic fringe is an expertly crafted action film that is taken to another level by the surprising depth of humanity particularly from charlize theron tom hardy taking mel gibsons former role plays the title character who gets caught up in a chase between cult leader immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne and one of his war rig drivers imperator furiosa charlize theron after she kidnaps his five wives  selected for their breeding furiosa is hoping to take the girls to safety in her homeland but must enlist the help of max when joe recruits his entire army to stop her and get his wives back director and cowriter george miller who did the previous three films does a great job of making fury road a standalone entity in the franchise one doesnt need to see any of the previous three films to appreciate the craftsmanship in the creation of this world and the elaborate chase sequences that feature some spectacular stunts and wellchoreographed battles mad max might be on the marquee but this is furiosas movie thanks to theron with her head shaven and a stump for a left arm theron is in complete kickass mode here an almost motherly approach to protecting the wives that gives the movie a heart and soul it is perhaps the best female heroine in an action film since sigourney weavers ripley in the aliens franchise also this week is pitch perfect 2 b the followup to the 2012 surprise hit that goes back to the well a lot  basically taking the strengths of the original and finding ways to do it again its a risk that hasnt worked in sequels to movies like the hangover but the calculated risk pays off here with enough laughs and music to satisfy fans of the original pitch perfect 2 picks up with the barden bellas a female acappella group at a fictional barden college on top of the world  threetime defending national champions and touring throughout the us when a performance for the president takes an unexpected turn the group is pulled from competition and the only way to be reinstated for future competitions is by winning the world championship the story is really secondary to the characters and music with the talented cast  including anna kendrick rebel wilson and brittany snow  all returning kendricks beca is still charming  even if the plot forces a conflict that seems to serve as a roadblock just for the sake of conflict im not really a fan of wilson and was afraid her role would be expanded to an annoyance level here but she works in small doses there are several new faces  including hailee steinfeld as the groups newest member  and a few fun cameos but the biggest addition is elizabeth banks taking the helm behind the camera banks shows poise and confidence as a firsttime director and accentuates its strengths the musical numbers zip and the oneliners come fast and furious but banks reels it all in to a satisfying concoction that fans of the original will surely enjoy pitch perfect 2 is rated pg13 for innuendo and language and is now playing at the regal bowling green stadium 12 and highland cinemas in glasgow

fury road partly due to circumstancesa metal grate attached to his face or intense car chase sequences not suitable for small talkbut mostly due to his character he is a man of great action and few words his wearybutsharp eyes reveal much of the complicated soul inside this weathered road warrior max is quickly caught up in circumstances beyond his control captured by a marauding gang from the citadel a desert butteturnedfortress ruled by the depraved immortan joe a disturbing villain who has set himself up as a deity ruling over the war boyshis gangand the suffering crowds below his elevated stronghold when one of joes best warriorsdrivers imperator furiosa charlize theron takes off with a war rig and his harem of wives used for breeding it sets off the chase sequence which makes up the bulk of the film essentially fury road is an extended chase sequence with furiosa and co on the run from joes war boys various vehicular gangs and the desert environment itself ever the loner max finds himself on the side of furiosa and the liberated women in their search for a hope and redemption in a new greener home  i dont often make such expansive claims but ill do so here mad max fury road is one of the top 10 action films ive ever seen and even a significant historic addition to the action pantheon fitting nicely alongside die hard hard boiled and terminator 2 as action films that will stand the test of time as influential and groundbreaking the design the art direction the choreography the cinematography the story the worldbuildingevery aspect of fury road is exceptional and valuable theres not a single wasted scene and this is the epitome of the motto show not tell fury road is incredibly cinematic a visual smorgasbord both beautiful and harsh in its palette the performances are outlandish where they need to be but often are quietly affecting especially theron as furiosa she truly is the star of the film a powerhouse of femininity and strength and a perfect partner in survival with max filmmaker george miller can move quickly from elaborate overhead shots of the desert landscape to intense and gritty action moments alongside the vehicles to intimate closeups of the human face particularly the eyes this visual rhythm makes fury road both intimate and sweeping in scopeits both ridiculously huge and authentically accessible  the best word to describe mad max fury road is exceptional uncommon atypical remarkable freakish outstanding unique special i still cannot believe a hollywood studio would pay to make this sending movie stars and inane vehicles into the desert to get blown up to put it bluntly fury road is batsht crazy in the best way possible example one vehicle in immortan joes war party is essentially a stack of amps and speakers carrying four enormous drums and a blind maniac strapped by bungee cords who plays a flamethrowing electric guitar if that sounds bizarre yet intriguingwell this is mad max a steampunkmeetsrevelation action flick also in a film genre where women are typically relegated to being sex objects or sidekicksthe recent avengers age of ultron hullabaloo is indicative of this propensityfury road gives women agency character significance and intelligence all while retaining their femininity furiosa and max are peers and partners their relationship is no budding romance but instead is marked by a growing care empathy and even friendship that compels max to remain at furiosas side through thick and thin and hes at her side not the other way around  the mad max films are unique as postapocalyptic action narratives and i appreciate how max is always the reluctant protagonist a wounded person reeling more from his personal tragedy than the world gone to hell in each mad max film hes caught up in circumstances where it initially has little or no agency to cause significant change but eventually accepts his role in the narrative as someone able to heal and save others even if he cannot save himself hes never looking for trouble or on some mission hes just wandering this world of fire and blood angry and dejected until some larger communal struggle pulls him into its center and he becomes a hesitantbuteventuallywilling savior the mad max films remind us we can never survive and wholly live entirely in isolation max always ends up in some sort of community and embraced true life beyond mere survival can only be experienced in the context of relationship yet despite the significant of community max also reminds us that the wildernessboth literal and spiritualis often a lonely place these deserts of personal pain are normative and even healthy to navigate alone max is a man who has experienced great personal pain and trauma he is the walking wounded maxs journey towards healing becomes an ongoing dialogue between solitude and communal life as he embraces community to liberate and redeem those who are lost he too finds healing and redemption  i dont think its an accident that max is a blood bag to those who are dying in fury road a universal donor whose very existence in this world of death can bring about restoration and new life fury road is a sort of reversed exodus story the movement of a small band of liberated people who end up returning to their place of captivity in order to start afresh they discover the home they seek is right where they started but only when that home is freed from tyranny and depravity for max and furiosa the only way to truly go home is through the long journey into the wilderness akin to walter brueggemans spirituality of the psalms and its movement from orientation to disorientation to new orientation then the cycle continues spiraling into greater depths as individuals and communities experience both great loss and hope mad max fury road is a thrilling picture of this spiritual cycle as well as the best action film of the year perhaps the decade 
Nov 12 2018,positive, george millers mad max fury road is spectacular  a cacophony of automotive carnage unlike anything that has ever graced the big screen miller delivers a blistering piece of action cinema  you can almost smell the grease and oil seeping through the sun drenched sandy vistas the director builds on the post apocalyptic world of his previous mad max movies upping the scope and making the desolate wasteland an even deadlier place to live tom hardy slips into mel gibsons battered leathers as max rockatansky the former cop haunted by the death of his family who now roams the cursed earth looking for solace max is hunted captured and hung up to be the blood bank for immortan joes hugh keaysbyrne war boys joe is a twisted despot who rules his citadel with oppression and fear using his own religion to keep his people in check he goes on the warpath when his trusted furiosa charlize theron drives off to freedom with joes five enslaved wives rosie huntingtonwhiteley riley keough zoë kravitz abbey lee kershaw and courtney eaton max and furiosa collide and form an alliance that will see them search for redemption along the fury road theres a primal essence to fury road that makes it stand out from the many plastic coated cgi filled blockbusters of the 21st century george miller might be looking to the future in fury roads dystopian narrative but hes infusing the whole thing with filmmaking techniques from the past the magnificent stunt work and the glorious vehicular action must to be seen to be believed miller might be 70 years old but his understanding of composing action sequences is second to none its even more impressive when you take into account that the majority of it was done without the use of computer effects you can sense the danger in every frame  this mise en scene is filled with mayhem glorious mayhem performances are often disregarded in action movies but fury road features a winning pair in tom hardy and charlize theron hardys max is bruised and battered from the getgo  hes the engine that gets the film s moving but theron is literally its driving force infusing furiosa with an energy and urgency which pushes hardys max into the passenger seat their dialogue is kept to a minimum but theyre able to deliver so much simply with their eyes hugh keaysbyrne delivers a hugely memorable screen villain in immortan joe hes the type of bug screen bad guy that you dont get anymore hes not two toned or complex  hes just evil and hes willing to stop at nothing to get what he wants nichola houts offers support as nux an addfuelled follower of joe who gets caught up in furiosas long drive to freedom mad max fury road is unlike any other hollywood blockbuster and george miller achieves the impossible by making an big budget action film that fails to play it safe in any way millers film is epic in scope and ambition and he has managed to deliver a film that may have pushed the limits of cinema to breaking point
Nov 9 2018,positive,a welcome return by george miller to the kind of anarchic action he hasnt directed in the three decades since thunderdome
Nov 1 2018,positive, in what is possibly the biggest gap between instalments of a franchise its been thirty years since mad max last rode across the wasteland in beyond thunderdome but whilst original star mel gibson may now have retired the role director of the original trilogy george miller is still holding on at the grand age of 70 miller has actually been planning fury road for over a decade now with various false starts over the years and even after getting the ball rolling shooting began in 2012 some reshoots and a long postproduction process have further delayed its release but now max is finally back and goddamn was it bloody worth the wait  mad max fury road has more of a premise than a cohesive narrative and whats there is mainly to set up a series of action sequences on first examination this seems like a really bad idea but much like the ragged machines the people of the wasteland drive it works beyond all reasonable expectations once the wheels literally get rolling and things start going boom everything clicks into place and the patchwork nature of the story becomes incredibly cohesive and durable the pacing is expertly handled weaving from set piece to set piece with just enough breathing space inbetween the carnage though dialogue is sparse fury roads flawless handling of visual storytelling gets across everything you need with just raw emotions and reactions you dont need to be told whats happening is crazy its plainly obvious the film hits every note possible creating a film that is thrilling funny thought provoking and even heart wrenching no joke i was close to tears near the end of this film and any film that manages that is clearly doing its job at maximum efficiency though gibsons portrayal of max will probably still be the de facto face of the character for generations to come tom hardys interpretation certainly lives up to the legend much like his predecessor hardys max is a man of few words and defines himself instead with his tough but fair attitude his tragic backstory is only hinted at the only real point where knowledge of the previous films may be helpful but that only adds to the mystique of the character but in many ways the film doesnt actually belong to max himself that honour falls to charlize therons imperator furiosa and she knocks it out of the park furiosas past is equally vague and her dialogue clipped but again we get more than enough just from therons pitchperfect performance she commands the screen with nothing more than a determined glare and a badass prosthetic arm and for stretches of the film youll forget that max is even thereand thats not a bad thing furiosas posse of runaway breeders yes thats what theyre called in the movie are just defined enough by distinct looks personality and crazy names one of them is called the splendid angharad nuff said and the gang of guntoting grannies they meet up with later are equally fun characters in the midst of all the explosions and testosterone fury road has a surprisingly strong feminist message at its core its a story about a group of women who are tired of being treated as objects and decide to fight back against their oppressors and max just happens to be along for the ride nicholas hoults nux adds a surprising amount of heart to the film mainly because he goes through the biggest arc over the course of the story starting out as a devout worshipper of antagonist immortan joe keaysbryne his development from there is surprisingly touching and youll be rooting for the skullfaced nutter by the end immortan joe himself is as ridiculous a villain as youd expect from a mad max film though not quite as memorable as the likes of lord humungous or master blaster he is a vile and threatening foe with a cool look and an awesome voice and thats all you really need as mentioned before most of the attention has been paid on the spectacle of the film and its a risk that pays off with interest there is not a single frame in fury road that is dull no matter the situation when cars arent flipping and guns arent firing theres always something to look at the beautifully pristine desert landscape the intricacies of the production and costume design the gorgeous use of colour or even just an interesting camera move or angle dop john seales work here is just phenomenal a true gem in his already long and stellar career and it certainly puts the camerawork on almost all blockbusters to shame along with the cinematography the editing is excellently attuned cutting to increase impact but also allowing shots to hold when needed as well as great use of both slow motion and spedup footage the score by junkie xl is a monster befitting of this movie combining metal rock electronic and orchestral music to craft a soundscape that accentuates the action unfolding onscreen rounding out this impeccably crafted piece of movie magic mad max fury road is an adrenaline shot of filmmaking from start to finish its unorthodox approach to storytelling eschews traditional structure and pacing to craft a tale in a new and exciting way relying on pure imagery to convey its bombastic narrative the characters are drawn with broad but striking strokes and youll be strongly connected to them despite most of them barely uttering a word the action sequences are some of the best in recent cinema history avoiding all the clichés and failures of the genre to create a rollercoaster experience both in terms of thrills and emotion its like an insane 80s bmovie but one made with thought effort and enough of a budget to match its deranged aspirations after it was all over all i wanted to do was turn back around and experience it again i cannot recommend this movie enough so get out to your local cinema and support this movie with your hardearned cash it doesnt just deserve your time it demands it
Oct 31 2018,positive, like a sublime dieselpunk opera scored for blood fire guns and accompanied by an orchestra of insanely trickedout vehicles mad max fury road roars to life in a breathless relentless two hours of sheer lunatic joy it isnt just the best action film of the summer it isnt just the best action film of 2015 it may be the best action film of the decade  tom hardy fills the worn leather boots of max rockatansky this time filling in for a tooold and definitelytoocrazy mel gibson max finds himself swept up in the mission of furiosa charlize theron a lieutenant to wasteland warlord immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne furiosa has gone rogue taking with her joes wives whose health and fertility are assets more valuable than the clean water source that joe lords over her goal is a pseudolegendary green place a land untouched by the nuclear apocalypse that turned the world into an endless desert  what on its surface looks to be a twohour car chase sequence is in actuality the most efficient masterful and criticalhit kind of narrative the dialogue is sparse and whats there is as lean and bare as the landscape the true narrative of the film is found in the visuals in the space between words and the actions of the characters even during quiet moments there is a palpable tension its a perfect reflection of a world where as maxs opening voiceover narrates there is only the instinct to survive the man behind the world of mad max directorcowriter george miller presents a meticulouslydetailed world of which fury road is only a small part while ostensibly a reboot of the original max trilogy it also doesnt directly contradict anything from those films and it fits very well in the exponential progression of its predecessors each film builds on the structure of the one before it in a natural growth and the latest entry is no exception miller is as confident and assured here as he has ever been and its clear this is his vision and his alone  narrative and worldbuilding is all well and good but a mad max film lives and dies on its dieselburning set pieces and fury road has those in abundance from vehicles covered in iron spikes to joes towering war drum caravan psychotic guitarist whose instrument belches flame included this is every bit a gearheads postapocalyptic fever dream the vehicle design in and of itself is something close to genius like the other components of the film nothing here is extraneous and not a single punch is pulled nor gratuitous nearly all of the effects are practical with cgi only coming in to enhance the already spectacular stunts it puts nearly every superhero film to shame thor may be fighting cosmic enemies but hes doing it in the green screen comfort of an airconditioned studio theres something primal and hypnotic to the chase scenes a brutal grace with a flow and a language all its own that could never be replicated by a computer even more striking and many times more impactful is the feminine power in the films story in a cinematic landscape where wonder woman cant escape development hell and black widow cant get an even share of a billiondollar franchise the femaleheavy cast of fury road seems downright revolutionary charlize therons furiosa is of course a total badass that was made clear right away in the first trailers but the wives are no wilting flowers either and eventually furiosas brigade is joined by a group of women warriors led appropriately enough by a character named valkyrie this story actually belongs to furiosa and the wives max just happens to be in it in fact aside from max and nicholas hoult as nux one of joes war boys there are almost no truly sympathetic male characters in the cast which isnt to say that max isnt welcome company mind you tom hardy is a perfect max so wellsuited for the role that he actually makes mel gibson seem miscast he seems like a more serious max than gibson ever was and he doesnt seem to wink at the camera nearly as much hardy is very much in tune with the deadpan black comedic subtext of millers campaign max is introduced to us as he chomps down on a twoheaded lizard which is humorous and horrifying in equal measures best of all hardy comes without anyshall we sayrealworld baggage that would distract from the role for all intents and purposes he is max  and like hardy there is nothing in this film that is out of tune every part comes together seamlessly even furiously to create an action symphony so perfect that it only comes around once every few years like the propulsive orchestraandelectronic score by junkie xl this is a film that is both raw and refined heavy and exhilarating miller has created nothing less than a masterpiece of enthralling cinematic mayhem
Oct 31 2018,positive, the film is set several years after a series of catastrophic worldwide events caused the downfall of civilization in the year 2060 ad  a desert community named the citadel is run by tyrannical leader immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne toecutter of the first mad max film because he controls the entire civilizations water supply one of his imperators named furiosa charlize theron at her most badass breaks off from a routine guzzoline the films version of gasoline run with joes five wives stowed away in an attempt to escape his clutches along the way they cross paths with max tom hardy a former highway patrolman who is now being used as a universal blood bag for joes army nicknamed the war boys in the interest of full disclosure it should be known that i have not seen any of the other mad max films so this review comes from a complete mad max virgin once i realized fury road would be unrelated to the previous films in the franchise i wanted to go in with a completely blank slate and zero expectations for a review of the film from an experiences mad max fan check out our very own jonathan barkans equally glowing review mad max fury road is unlike any film i have ever seen essentially an extended chase sequence there are set pieces in the film that legitimately had my mouth hanging wide open miller was present at the screening i was at and stated that roughly 90 of the effects in the film are practical he also said that eight cameras were destroyed during filming with the exception of one heinous meantfor3d use of cgi in one of the the final scenes of the film it shows what miller was able to capture on screen is nothing short of a miracle and truly shows off his talents as a director credit must also go to john seale whose cinematography is mesmerizing while i was unable to see the film in imax 3d i can say that a regular 2d showing is sufficient and doesnt detract from the intended experience also great is that the film does not pander to its audience the film kicks into high gear from the opening frame with no time for exposition  there is no opening scroll informing the audience what happened to the world and the state civilization is in now there are no characters unrealistically explaining what is going on to other characters since everyone on screen already knows we are dropped right into the middle of this dystopian society and hit the ground running speaking of dialogue it would be interesting to see the script for this one as there is little dialogue in the film the acting is uniformly great from everyone involved hardy is perfectly serviceable as our stoic hero but the show really belongs to theron no one ever doubted her abilities as an actress but she taps into a carnal brutality here that is captivating the whole film is a marvel to behold but the final act of the film manages to best everything that came before it in a spectacular sequence involving the war boys swinging on poles a tease of this was glimpsed in the final trailer for the film even though it has a 2hour running time fury road feels much shorter this is one of the highest compliments any film can receive i didnt want it to end and i cant wait to go back to see it again once it gets released this weekend mad max fury road is the best action movie i have seen so far this year and i doubt anything else coming out will be able to top it i wont be able to praise it enough so do yourself a favor and get yourself to the theater this weekend and see it you wont regret it up next from director jaume colletserra house of wax orphan the shallows is the universal  blumhouse thriller the woman in the yard and the cast is growing this week deadline reports that russell hornsby fences has signed on to star in the upcoming thriller joining the previously announced danielle deadwyler the harder they fall the woman in the yard written by sam stefanak is scheduled to be released in theaters on january 10 2025 at this time any and all plot details are under wraps stay tuned jason blum and stephanie allain are producers on the film jaume colletserra danielle deadwyler gabrielle ebron scott greenberg and james moran are eps haley pigman and jungyoon kim are the executives covering the film for blumhouse

Aug 29 2018,positive, to say that george miller has stepped up his game since he left us at thunderdome would be far too mild a statement to open with mad max fury road is not just superior to everything in this franchise as well as everything else miller has ever directed its among the most exhausting thrilling visceral action films ever made powerful villainous white guys have ruined the planet by way of their greed for oil and their warmongering and now they are sustaining their power by taking control of womens reproductive systems so you know pretty farfetched but max doesnt belong to any of these festering wounds called societies hes feral again no telling how long its been since max saved the kids from aunty entity but hes lost himself again wandering the desert hunted by man and haunted by those he couldnt save again miller puts max in a position to redeem himself by helping the vulnerable and pure survive this apocalyptic future mercifully there are no children and no mullets this goround unsurprisingly the great tom hardy delivers a perfect guttural performance as the road warrior as his reluctant partner in survival charlize theron is the perfect mix of compassion and badassedness hardys a fascinating mysterious presence but theron owns this film like the first two films in this series fury road wastes little time on dialogue or plotting rather it is basically one long magnificent car chase miller adorns every scene with the most astonishing peculiar imagery and the vehicular action is like nothing youve ever seen millers magnificent action sequences keep the film from ever hitting the dragging monotony of his first two efforts in the series while the characters remain as paper thin as they have been in every episode the vast superiority of this cast from top to bottom guarantees that the marauding bands excess and abandon are handled with genuine skill fury road amounts to a film about survival redemption and the power of the universal blood donor clever spare scripting makes room for indulgent set pieces that astonish and amaze theres real craftsmanship involved here  in the practical effects the pacing the disturbing imagery and the performances that hold it all together  that marks not just a creative force at the top of his game but a high water mark for summer blockbusters
Aug 27 2018,positive, after more than a decade of writing about movies the oscars somehow still raise a fire in me i know i will be disappointed i know there will be one or two wins that seem perfect one or two speeches that surprise just like i know that most of the lauded films will be about white men enduring something i know the oscars matter on a business and cultural level no matter what the coen brothers  whove conveniently already earned a few  say winning is power and power is money and money lets people decide which stories get told this years stories are good stories but by and large theyre familiar and made by familiar names the most familiar story  the one about a young person falling in love and finding her way  is in an odd twist perhaps the most subversive of the lot for the way it respects that young womans ordinary existence life can be complicated enough when its just life  bear attacks interplanetary stranding or not its maybe funny to call the martian a confinement film  dudes got a whole planet to himself  but mark watney matt damon lives inside a bubble a rover or a spacesuit without a lick of outdoor air entertaining and visually appealing though it is the martian lacks one key element characters mark can be dry funny and sarcastic but everyone else gets singlenote personalities noble sean bean socially inept the math guys efficient chiwetel ejiofor tense kristen wiig as a story of survival it works but its hollow room is the opposite as much a story of what comes after as a story of the terrible captivity of ma brie larson and jack jacob tremblay a movie that improves on the novel on which its based is a rare bird  and room is all the more rare as emma donoghue wrote both she chiseled her own novel into a film that understands will they escape is only half the question then what how do you spend years confined and then go back to a world of cell phones computers cable news open spaces soccer balls the martian doesnt ask about the aftermath it doesnt ask much of anything at all frankly the force awakens shouldve taken the scifi slot but its less concerned with science than it is with myth  and its mythology isnt the kind the academy cares for what is the revenant if not mythologizing the astonishing man on a noble vengeance quest pushed to extremes part of a brutal world while i disliked alejandro gonzález iñárritus birdman i can appreciate it if i squint and tilt my head until all the characters look like part of riggans psyche theres no trick that makes the revenant work like that its an endurance test with beautiful cinematography and to be fair a notable nod to the terrible treatment of native people were hardly lacking in movies about determined white men fighting their way through to something see also the martian there will be blood gladiator how have the filmmakers  and dicaprio  so cleverly shifted the narrative around this film to make it mean something it means that cinematographer emmanuel lubezki is a genius to have gotten some of those shots it means that no one saw valhalla rising another movie about men suffering though with a change of weather and more hallucinogens  on the flip side of everything  of climate of gender of theme  are the sweltering sands of mad max fury road a movie just as inventively filmed and edited just as beautiful and with so much more to say  about power destruction misogyny freedom fear and the world we live in its by no means a perfect film but its an action movie with a heart and a mind built to do much more than just make you feel as if youve endured a visual pummeling  the big short will leave you feeling mentally pummeled and probably rather depressed smart wry cleverly playful in its anger adam mckays film about the corrupt banking system owes some of its palpable sense of rage to ryan goslings bitter voiceovers and the delightful peculiar moments at which the movie breaks the fourth wall mckay and his cowriter charles randolph working from michael lewis nonfiction book know that this is a lot of esoteric bullshit to take in so at times the narrative stops with celebrities explaining the finer points of mortgage bonds dizzying biting full of great performances the big short is probably too smart to win an oscar and those two words  sturdy and sly  bring me to the last two best picture nominees the ones with less highgloss shine and media spin bridge of spies is dramatic to be sure but steven spielberg can make this kind of movie while sleepwalking smooth smart unsubtle in its interest in reminding us of the kind of people we can be its also here to remind us that mark rylance is brilliant and underused in film bridge of spies is unquestionably timely concerned with how people can be more than their jobs more than their families well white men can anyway and that a nation is only as good as its people the grownup almost oldfashioned style of spielbergs latest shows a sure hand but i miss the innovative spielberg the one who created aliens and adventures and freaking giant dinosaurs this is the cinematic equivalent of the dad who grew up and got conservative  not socially but in bearing and demeanor  brooklyn is conservative on the surface but when you scratch that periodpiece façade you find something rare in this batch of nominees a beautiful gently funny bless every actress in those boarding house scenes movie that takes the interior life of a young woman entirely seriously as eilis lacey saoirse ronan carries this film so splendidly that in any year that was not so utterly brie larsons it would be a crime not to give her every award you can practically see her eyes changing colors with her moods brooklyn is also about america and the mythology of coming here shares the screen with the lure of what youve left behind the possibility of other lives that still tempt you even if the shoes dont fit director john crowley has a sense of timing that gives every one of brooklyns scenes a thoughtfulness even a tiny role like that of eilis departmentstore boss has layers of sympathy nothing melodramatic and terrible happens to eilis just life in all its 1950s colors and shapes that such a moving film came out of such traditional shapes is magic in and of itself this womans choices should be her own then now always 
Aug 24 2018,positive, its been 30 years since george millers last outing on the road with mad max it can be hard to come back to a series so embedded in the cult film phenomena and have a leading man so iconic that dads the world over are crying battle cries of no one can ever be mel gibson but somehow miller has managed to create one of the best straightup action films of at least the past decade in the world of mad max and in his own words the only goal is to survive not stated in any particular time frame other than sometime later violence is the way to survival as shown in pretty much any dystopian movie ever the earths inhabitants have adapted societies have been formed and the structure of yesteryear has been forgotten of course there is going to be anarchy and destruction the entire basis of the original mad max trilogy in this world you cannot exist without violence and destruction people born into this world find joy in the chaos particularly the war boys whose cries of immortan and witness me shrill through the cinema we revel in their elation and gladly jump aboard the war rigs down the fury road cinema will always divulge the obscene and violent that personally i cant get enough of and i dont believe that will change soon but when a film is directly commenting on patriarchy and social structure how can we complain outside of the chase scenes the ideas behind fury road are rooted in patriarchy despite the earths current state a leader has emerged to exploit and use the people of the citadel immortan joe immortan joe believes himself to be some form of deity the man to save the people he exploits different social groups for his own gain and controls access to water food milk and the gene pool which has led to extreme deformities in his people his war boys serve him and deal with the action and the war pups turn the cogs of the water wheel the war boys believe he has come to save them that if they do his bidding he will grant them access to valhalla from norse mythology they are bred and rewarded for war so i can forgive them for taking enjoyment in such acts immortan joe is also a class a misogynist he dabbles in sex slavery and keeps the most beautiful women in one room so he can use and abuse them and gain a male heir in the case of wife cheedo the fragile courtney eaton she even experiences a kind of stockholm syndrome attempting on numerous occasions to get back to immortan where she believes she is safest the reason dystopian movies are so great is because you can examine society in this way you can break down these imaginary societies groups see their motives and see the way they exploit different if extreme narratives which can always been brought back to our current reallife society considering these traumatic events the five wives go through there has also been much speculation about whether or not the film is feminist for me its a difficult task to solidly declare something feminist or not feminist because what might be empowering to one woman may be downright offensive to another my main criticism of the film as a whole was the lack of poc across the board and a few slurs twice but what ive always admired and will continue to praise is someone who tries rome wasnt built in a day and the film industry is not going to be bursting with varied characters of all ages races sexualities genders and backgrounds in a day either if we continue to praise and support movies that show some attempt and understanding then up can be the only way my friends as someone very much in love with the gun wielding chicks trope but also very tired of the hunger games led trope of this woman is saving her world because she is special and the reason she is special is because shes a woman and thats so unlikely fury road stood out to me in a film series usually so heavily drowned in testosterone what was so interesting to me was that george miller could have set the plot as max escaping from the citadel and for some reason takes the brides with him too but no miller chose a woman character to carry out the task imperator furiosa may be my favourite female character in a long time charlize theron is phenomenal as the onearmed war rig driver representation of disabled bodies yes her determination clear passion and teary eyes all through the first half are forever embedded in my mind and her anguish at the green place is up there in the most iconic shots in the film furiosas authority is never questioned by max her abilities as a woman are never doubted and her abilities as a disabled woman are never doubted like anyone encountering another human in this barren wasteland maxs only hostility is upon their meeting when hes trying to save his own life the fact that even a lone ranger such as max can respect women in a society where people kill rape and blow each other up for kicks is quite a feat for your standard flashy blockbuster to the disappointment of many male fans and the elation of many female ones the entire plot of fury road focuses around furiosas transportation of immortans five wives to the green place whilst a film discussing a woman single handily literally ending a sex slave trade in a never ending chase scene is completely thrilling the brides themselves were pretty onedimensional a shame because the slight hints of their personality we did see were really interesting toast zoe kravitz clearly favoured herself as the next furiosa keen to handle weapons and get amongst the action capable riley keough showed great compassion for nux the dag abbey lee was very spiritual but the most striking image in the entire 120 minutes for me was splendid rosie huntingtonwhiteley throwing her pregnant body out of a car in a high speed chase to protect furiosa these women are not just pretty faces they have individual personalities and what miller managed to communicate in what he described as a silent movie relying little on dialogue and mainly on implying was more than adequate the criticism of the wives beauty from viewers is rooted in misogyny they are not too modellike to be in this dystopia immortan chose these women specifically for their beauty a man still practising the eurocentric beauty standards we hold currently they were locked away and kept slim for breeding purposes he clearly believes that keeping these women separate will eliminate the deformities in the gene pool the first shot we see of the wives is also up for comment what some say is a malegaze doused magazine spread i personally find to be an exclamation of freedom the girls hose down in a desert almost like a mirage we see a closeup of the girls removing chastity belts emblazoned with immortans skull emblem a sign of his property with the breaking of the belts the girls attitudes change abbey lee kershaw kicks hers away in a fuck you to her previous life  i also enjoyed the older female their hardened faces and deep wrinkles telling a thousand stories they had quick wit and a fast mouth revelling in the thought of a new battle to face these women have survived for so long their thinking almost mimics that of the war boys killing for fun the attitudes of fury road seek solace in womens liberation and dont shun or mock it miller wanted to make a straight up action film utilising the bigger budget and technologies 2015 has to offer its excusable to me that the backstories run a little dry the mad max franchise has been this way since its beginning iconic characters are created and loved with just so much as a name the coma doof warrior has already been solidified as a fanfavourite character from this film and we know so little about him his electrifying flamethrower metal soundtracking the film and a distinct warning call for immortan and the war boys arrival the thumping drums and booms amp up the film on a whole other level something i havent felt since interstellar the way the different music was used to signify the arrival of another war party was a sonic experience i need to see more of and would happily sit and read an entire novella on every last character i seen on screen this is what miller has given us a world so rich in detail and drenched with love that we cant possibly comprehend the entire scale of the thing i can only hope that miller takes the critical success of fury road and adapts the same approach for his next few films i cant wait to see more of the rich comic book type cinematography even zack snyder would be envious of and tom hardys ridiculously perfect pout with an overall consensus of this is the best thing ive ever seen i hope the rest of the action movie world are quaking in their boots from the madness chloe leeson is 19 and from the north of england the proper north she believes harmony korine is the future and is pretty sure she coined the term selfie central she doesnt like pina coladas or getting caught in the rain but she does like ezra miller  dane dehaan a whole lot her favourite films are the beach lords of dogtown and into the wild but dont talk to her about paranormal activity she rants kawaiigoff
Aug 21 2018,negative,mad max fury road is one of the worst and meaningless movies i have ever seen
Jul 24 2018,positive, theres plenty of motion stunts explosions visual effects and wonderfully weird postapocalyptic images characters and design to keep most reasonably minded filmgoers happy as they munch on their popcorn sip on their drinks and think about their grocery list the original mad max trilogy  and the first two films especially  are rightly regarded as standard setting gamechanging classics yet while it bears the brand name and tries very hard fury road cant quite honour the legacy of its forebears its fine bgrade mulch but its certainly no masterpiece the new adventure finds max played by the ubiquitous and somewhat miscast tom hardy rather than the originals mel gibson a loner with a supedup car in a wasteland filled with motorised marauders his only purpose is to survive at first he is captured by the manic minions of king immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne aka toecutter from the first film but not playing the same character before joining forces with renegade truck driver furiosa charlize theron a postapocalyptic feminist warrior with a marvellously rendered artificial arm shes done the dirty on joe the evil overlord of the region by stealing his five young slave wives and speeding them off across the desert to a new land and a new life max helps them traverse the sands with their enemies in hot pursuit when vehicles arent kicking up dust trails and crashing against each other at high speed the soundtrack throbs anxiously as max and furiosa negotiate their next move everwary of the giant vehicles in the distant heat haze heading their way especially impressive are the bizarre vehicle designs which look like beautiful mechanical mutations or artworks on wheels one item even looks like a distant relative of the spiked vw from peter weirs 1974 film the cars that ate paris given how distinctive and inventive the action scenes in the original films were it is disappointing that so much of the mechanical bumpandgrind here lacks any real spark or originality men fly about on poles gunfire is exchanged people scream and the mandatory fireballs send vehicles twirling into midair  an exhausted actionmovie cliche that really needs to be retired and for all his supposed genius original director george miller has slavishly adopted the standard editing rhythm of the standard 21st century tentpole movie with a cut every second or so even michael bay holds shots longer so what is the film trying to do in a way the answer is in the films prolonged chases which serve as a metaphor for the film itself whereas the original trilogy set the pace in the early 1980s and influenced everything from the terminator to waterworld fury road is more a case of mad max trying to catch up and prove itself worthy the brand once set the bar now it is trying to reach the bar set by others and as moderately exciting and framefilling as its explosive setpieces are they dont quite make it theres nothing in fury road for instance that matches the brilliance of the chases in matrix reloaded to live and die in la or even quentin tarantinos death proof since the fourth one in 2009 the ff series has established itself as the dominant brand for automotive mayhem through its house style of elaborate stunts and preposterous digitallyassisted action sworn to continually top the previous film they are full of kinetic images and ideas weve never seen before fury road cant make that boast the very cleverly edited trailer certainly builds that expectation but the prangs and demolition on show are at the end of the day pretty standard theres certainly nothing that tops what we saw in the finale of mad max 2 which still stands as the franchises golden hour like so many blockbusters mad max fury road is essentially a twoact story stretched out to featurelength running time with an unmotivated max the film feels dramatically hollow as it is only other people who compel him to act hes a cypher in the wasteland with no real purpose he only has a few scant lines of dry dialogue but nothing as punchy as his classic line from mad max 2 you wanna get outta here you talk to me for the record its not a reboot because it has flashbacks to the original films plus as we all know too well by now to reboot a franchise you need to have an origin story this film simply drops us into the familiar postapocalyptic world we left max in at the end of thunderdome might fury road have been better as a proper reboot perhaps was it a mistake to make a mad max film without mel gibson who created the role perhaps after all youd never make a dirty harry movie without clint eastwood gibson was involved with earlier plans for the fourth film but after too many delays and the passage of time he eventually counted himself out just a thought but how cool would it have been to have him play max at age 60 still humping around the wasteland still fighting the scum still angry it would have given the enterprise the mythological heft and powerful sense of continuity that fury road lacks its understandable how some audiences  presumably younger ones that did not grow up with the original films  might be a little suspicious of a franchise that tries firing up after being dormant so long that was certainly the case with star wars episode 1 the phantom menace but as with that film its likely that the anticipation the legacy and the affection for the original films will earn fury road a lot of free passes from forgiving filmgoers  provided of course that there is more to come and of course there is miller is planning more mad max films he even has two screenplays completed apparently lets just hope he give max a lot more to do the next time around than follow somebody elses lead  with its tongue pressed firmly in its cheek a royal night out is a prettily decorated politely outrageous piece of cinematic confectionery a carefully balanced soufflelight slice of historical fiction that has a great deal of fun playing with the truth by dropping two reallife princesses into a fictitious teen romp the gossamer of fact upon which this merrily mounted lark is based is that on the evening of 8 may 1945  aka ve day the end of the war in europe  the young radiantly beautiful future queen of england princess elizabeth sarah gadon and her highspirited if notquitesobeautiful nevertobequeen sister margaret bel powley talked their parents queen elizabeth emily watson and king george vi rupert everett into letting them out of buckingham palace  where theyve been cloistered  and into the celebrating throng accompanied by two of the british armys most incompetent officers the girls are soon off the leash and on their own drinking dancing and mixing it with real people its an eventful evening of characterbuilding adventure elizabeth is on a mission to gauge the true mood of the people and to see how the kings radio speech has gone down hooking up with an angry soldier jack jack reynor who is absent without leave elizabeth also goes through a reality check as she has her beliefs challenged and witnesses the scale of loss london has suffered there is much running yelling drinking and falling over chiefly in the seedier parts of town but while director julian jarrold  a period film specialist with becoming jane brideshead revisited the girl all the kings men and great expectations  effectively works up a wildparty vibe he knows not to cross certain lines after all hes toying with the reputation of real royals the film is plently of fun  seen with a cinema full of senior filmgoers every comic beat hit its mark  and while its not intended to do so a royal night out will no doubt deeply irritate those republicans who would rather not see the royals celebrated the 70th anniversary of ve day has just ticked over the queen is more popular than ever prince william and princess kate have just had a kid  a girl charlotte no less  and the new generation of young attractive media savvy royals appear to be bringing a new generation of supporters into the royalist fold the director swears all this is very happy coincidence no doubt it is but its also very telling that this deep into the 21st century a film about the teenage shenanigans of two princesses would have any appeal at all and along with the kings speech and the queen a royal night out could well be part of the start of a process of mythologising and humanising the cinematic image of the queen after all its happened with every other monarch and this one has certainly done enough to warrant the enduring attention of filmmakers on the news that theyre going to have a baby an estranged couple eve camille keenan and charlie dustin clare walk about the earthquakeshattered city of christchurch trying to piece together their relationship hoping the other will compromise enough deftly directed by kiwi michelle joy lloyd sunday is a modest neatly etched character study of two people in transition clearly inspired by the conversational style of richard linklaters sunrise trilogy the film could have done with a few more illmannered arguments before hitting home with its touching finale  sunday has made a small but significant step into the history books by being the first film in australia to be released simultaneously in cinemas and on a wide range of digital platforms with this must come a new way of reviewing films with this release pattern as a valueformoney person this reviewer always considers the general cost of admission to a cinema and the associated bother when reviewing a new release as they are always in cinemas this does change when reviewing things for the home market as the costs are lower while the convenience is greater therefore something that might not be worth seeing in cinemas might nonetheless make for a better more economical experience as a home release and the experience of watching something at home is markedly different with ambient noise distractions and the ability to watch things on screens of varying sizes in the case of sunday is this lowbudget twohander worth seeing in the cinema for about 20 a ticket no but seeing it for a few dollars via a digital platform most definitely
May 21 2018,positive, you dont realize just how crappy most action movies are until you see something like mad max fury road  a movie in which there are no action scenes because the action pretty much never stops and the films constant sense of violent motion is in the service of incredible imagery and transcendant moments lots of directors have tried to do what george miller pulls off so astonishingly in fury road  the feeling that shit never stops blowing up the intensity and above all the sense that the heightened reality of comics and video games is finally appearing in liveaction films im thinking of zack snyder michael bay robert rodriguez and a few others  but mad max fury road is still in a class by itself there are so many moments in this movie where i found myself saying wow i cant believe im seeing this  either because the visuals were so insane or so extreme or just because there was intense beauty filling the frame these moments cumulatively turn what could have been a runofthemill postapocalyptic fightchasefight movie into something actually poignant and emotionally engaging  because your mind is flooded with so much insane imagery you get opened up to the actually quite good performances by charlize theron tom hardy and others in mad max fury road its the same postapocalyptic world that youll remember from the road warrior and beyond thunderdome more or less everything has fallen apart and theres been some kind of ecological collapse  and in a modern twist theres not enough water either max rockatansky hardy gets ensnared with a group of whitepainted skullfaced assholes called the war boys led by the terrifying immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne and soon max is caught in the middle of a custody dispute between immortan joe and the insane shavedheaded imperator furiosa theron cue a lot of shit blowing up crazy war rig trucks people swinging through the air on big fishing rods dangling off of cars going 100 mph and stunts that would make the fast and furious movies feel slow and sedated i cannot emphasize enough that this movie almost never stops going  a huge amount of the films running length takes place on board moving vehicles in fact this movie reminded me of nothing so much as snowpiercer both in its focus on battles aboard a moving vehicle in an extreme environment and in its heightenedreality absurdist take on an apocalyptic world weve been judging action scenes by too low a standard can you tell whats going on is the camera too shaky or too blurry or is the cg so cheap that youre just seeing smudges are there quick cuts that keep you from following the moves or a bewildering mixture of tootight closeups and toofar wide shots thats like judging a gymnastics meet by the number of gymnasts who show up with broken ankles mad max fury road has action thats easy to follow but also incredibly overwhelming in the sheer insanity and complexity of whats going on at any given moment were talking about basically a twohour truck joust miller uses techniques that ive seen overused elsewhere  like the hard zoom into the face of someone driving crazily  but here they just add drama to an already oversaturated kinetic frame the camera is constantly in motion as it tracks in on people crashing their vehicles and launching projectiles at each other  which brings me to the nut of what makes fury road such a unique theatrical experience miller uses the constant motion of the film to enhance its sense of scale because duh if you cover a lot of ground quickly you reveal the true vastness of the landscape immortan joes insane villain lair is huge and so is his horde of unsafe drivers and the land around them most of all is just massive  the untameable unknowable desert plays a starring role in this movie at least as much as the vehicles do and the hugeness and terribleness of that bleak landscape makes the largerthanlife characters feel weirdly at home even as it informs the movies key themes of trying to fill that dead void with something after three previous mad max films miller understands that the postapocalyptic story isnt so much about the collapse of societys institutions but about what replaces them  and hes fascinated by the twisted attempts to create a functioning society in the ruins of our own  in a lot of ways the mad max franchise belongs to the same subgenre as the judge dredd comics  its about a world thats been laid waste but also about the absurdity of surviving in that world the heightened reality and bizarreness of both worlds is about holding up a mirror to show us how artificial and bizarre our own identities are and then creating a new extreme context where only ridiculous and psychotic selves make any sense  whats new in fury road is an obsession with fertility  one character carries around heirloom seeds that stubbornly refuse to grow in this dead world immortan joe counsels people dying in the desert not to become addicted to water immortan joes most prized possessions are his breeders four women whose existence is only aimed at carrying immortan joes babies and the war boys have an ideology built around death and birth  if they die in immortan joes service they will be reborn even the perennial mad max concern with fuel is somewhat reinvented because now its also about water and the ability to create green agriculture is a collective enterprise in which the individual has to become part of the collective and so is human fertility to some extent so fury road is all about the rights of the individual in the face of the obsession with fertility  and in the end this does become an overtly feminist issue imperator furiosa and the breeders are fighting for their freedom but also searching for an alternative vision of society that doesnt see them as nothing but objects  without going into too much spoilery detail theron is the emotional linchpin of the movie channeling so much intensity and grim humor that she literally drives the story forward furiosa is one of the great action heroes up there with max himself and theron manages to put a lot of nuance and generosity into her she carries most of the weight of the movies themes about selfdetermination cult psychology and fertility and its largely thanks to her worldweary performance that the movie can get overtly feminist without ever seeming preachy  what makes max unique in this world is that he has no ideology every other character in fury road voices an idea about how the world works or what it all means  but maxs opening voiceover says that hes been reduced to just one thing the desire to survive at all costs he believes in nothing but hes haunted by visions of the people whom he cared about in the past whom he failed to save max spends most of the film listening to other people describe their complicated worldviews with a mute shrug hes such a nihilist he cant even articulate his nihilism mad max fury road is like a really great rock concert where you hold up your lighter until you burn your fingertips and you scream yourself hoarse and afterwards you feel like youve had a personal beautiful mindfuck this is one of the few movies ive ever seen where the whole audience broke into spontaneous loud applause a third of the way in the overthetop stylized absurdist aesthetic is pushed to its limit and a lot of the films dialogue is frankly ridiculous but the ultimate result is so extreme and married to such beautiful imagery that it becomes a great work of art
Apr 30 2018,positive, a childrens movie about how great science is the martian has a pragmatic message for budding astronauts you solve one problem then another and see if you survive the films obsession with yearslong plans imparts a soviet feel to the space program depicted but its sunny optimism keeps the movie allamerican not once do we believe the martian will end with a shot of matt damons skeleton halfburied in sand maybe the film is so bright because the days are thirtynine minutes longer on mars than on earth the same thirtynine minutes that should have been cut from this fridayless robinson crusoe kristen wiig however is on hand to show that girls arent into the lord of the rings ridley scotts backlot mars offers a parable for new yorkers considering the move to la once you relocate youre stranded and the chances of getting home are remote yes youll have a vegetable garden you can sit near and watch the beautiful sunsets but youll be alone 50 million miles from your loved ones youll conduct your social life via text and skype make trips to the desert in your electric car youll continue to shave every day on the off chance you get a meeting the movies can put a positive spin on anything seeing the world anew or for the first time becomes an allegory of motherhood and childhood in room which puts its protagonist brie larson in a situation not unlike matt damons in the martian but earthbound and worse if the martian is a friendly version of dark ridley scott scifi room domesticates repugnant horror with spiritual uplift held hostage in a shed with the 5yearold shes had with her rapist captor ma becomes a standin for every young mother isolated by child care chained by domestic servitude and abused at night by a man whos out all day in a world she may never see again this dismal parody of heterosexual coupling reinforces the idea that its time to have families in some new way a tour de force of subtlety and restraint 45 years is the perfect movie to see alone if youve just broken up with someone and want confirmation it was a good idea no need to waste decades in coupledom if all it amounts to is an unnoticed gesture of frustrated defiance the film saves that moment for its last shot which isnt quite the indictment its meant to be thats because the film stacks the deck against tom courtenays character a retiree recovering from a heart attack courtenays performance is a model of invisible acting even when hes doddering or fumbling an important speech at a party but the film belongs to charlotte rampling a star presence who can command the screen just by watching the passing landscape from a boat the performances in the big short are carried by wigs makeup and bad suits like in a silent comedy adam mckay will ferrells director cuts away from everyones big moments in their big scenes almost walking away from them christian bale with a fake glass eye to go with his wig moves the film along by himself for large chunks of it often by air drumming despite the large cast of hollywood dudes giving it to hedge funders by playing them as selfdeluded slickster oafs who will never be ryan gosling or brad pitt no matter how many billions they sock away the explanatory cameos by margot robbie anthony bourdain selena gomez and richard thaler barely work and the margot robbie one is a sarcastic winkwink insult to the audience that almost sinks the whole movie while at the same time referring to the wolf of wall street a better film than this even though mckay gives the impression he is using recognizable forms of infotainment to educate us the film doesnt do thatits barely in the form of a movie this disrespect is what makes the big short so satisfying it jeers at and burlesques wall street for letting the crash happen using michael lewiss book to show there were people who knew it was going to happen its slapdash quality reinforces the idea that it needed to be made a fairy tale of leanin capitalism about a cinderella without a prince david o russells joy recasts the crazy family of a capra comedy with stellar toxicity joys jennifer lawrences undermining relatives are the selfish american clan par excellence claiming to know everything about joys business while undermining her future robert de niro and isabella rossellini playing eviluniverse versions of themselves as joys father and stepmother delight in their performances as fickle scoffers joy is a natural inventor prone to epiphanies about household productsthe film could be called a beautiful mop her ingenuity and tenacity save her from a life of drudgery though by the end her victory seems hollow the film busy with fake tv soap operas and flashbacks doesnt imagine another life for her except maybe settling down with a cabletv executive bradley cooper who lectures her and is wrong half the time the mitigating factors in her struggle are that she can turn a profit employ her friends and help younger women manufacture improved lint brushes set in the early 1990s joy suggests these were the consolations workingclass gen x could hope for a series of epic walkandtalks about the future retconned to be 100 percent correct because theyre about our present for example the amazing steve predicts that journalism will change because of computers he says that in 1998 the same year aaron sorkin found out by the end when super steve tells his estranged daughter he will invent the ipod for her the movie is indistinguishable from a tv commercial they should have given steve jobs away for free without anyone asking for it like that u2 album that way people users might have watched it by accident a nasty film about the drug war on the usmexico border that flirts with fascism and artiness succumbing to the former the film suggests that the best way for donald trump to convince the mexican government to pay for building a wall would be to tell them it would keep out the cia benicio del toro maybe the last actor from the robert mitchum mold plays an agencybacked hit man with blasé menace del toro like mitchum is a strange often indifferent actor who apparently spins a wheel of fortune to choose his roles once he settles on one hes either good or bad in it depending on something no one can figure out maybe if work starts on a tuesday it doesnt matter who directs him in films by auteurs like paul thomas anderson and arnaud desplechin he can range from okay to not good and then in an overblown thriller like this he shows up with something to prove in some scenes he stares at emily blunt like hes reminding her she is not an american and doesnt work for the fbi shes just a movie star playing a cop tom hooper knows that eyes are important in cinema so he has directed the actors in the danish girl to search the corners of rooms with their glances like they cant find their keys or a mouse just ran by he makes them dolllike ventriloquists dummies and when they talk to each other they converse in needspeak like they are explaining which line to get into at the dmv the film begins in 1925 so hooper has imparted a silentmovie feel to the danish girl everyone in this movies europe has been hypnotized by dr caligari or tortured like joan of arc eddie redmayne as lili plays along his coyness telegraphing femininity he puts a flower between his teeth like chaplin and seems forever on the verge of picking up two forks and sticking them into dinner rolls to make them dance since the film is about painters hooper hired jan vermeer to be his cinematographer womens captivity is the great theme of most of 2015s oscarnominated films and ex machina is the most basic and manipulative of these the tale of a hapless john sent on a bizarre mission by a pimp to see if he can free his whore the sordidness is made oblique because the characters are a programmer a genius ceo and a pixie android and its set in a sterile underground lab this taxi driver for nerds is heavy with the fear of superwomen empowered by datadriven emotional intelligence and synthetic physical perfection and hence able to outflank male idiots savants ex machina succeeds as a mindfuck stage play for three actors domhnall gleeson oscar isaac and alicia vikander who were in a total of about a dozen films this year all less weird and talky than this one the unavoidable onslaught of virtual reality and artificial intelligence will make stories like this ever more relatable to lonely techies in search of mechanical love in robot form but not to me theres not even room in my apartment for a vacuum cleaner nothing better could have been expected from the seventh film in the rocky franchise than this flight from hollywood back to philadelphia the savvy intelligence and heart of director ryan cooglers screenplay equals his achievement in getting an assignment like this after making fruitvale station in oakland at age 26 boxing movies come with builtin emotional manipulation and this one is no exception establishing a family for donnie michael b jordan by bringing back a rocky balboa stricken with lymphoma stallone will go down in movie history as the only star of his generation willing to make way for millennials and for black america like this michael b jordans donnie a proam boxer rejects his status as the son of rockys rival apollo creed and exiles himself to workingclass philadelphia where he cajoles rocky into training him when he finally puts on his fathers redwhiteandblue trunks before the big fight the moment is hokey but astute hes forced to imitate a father who didnt raise him and who is not there to see whats he made of himself at the movies end rockys illness is left uncured and donnie isnt quite a champion leaving the story ready for an eighth round the last scene on the steps of the philadelphia museum of art predicts the ending of star wars the force awakens but undercuts its own myth its clear that ryan coogler got cheated by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences is there any doubt creed was as welldirected and wellwritten as say room coming a year after selmas ava duvernay and david oyelowo were ignored in the oscar nominations ignoring coogler was especially troubling proof of the problem oscarssowhite exposedthat the academy consciously ignores black artists jada pinkett smiths viral video about her husband will smiths lack of a nomination for concussion was justified even if janet huberts response video reminding smith that years ago he had refused to stand with other cast members of the fresh prince of belair when they wanted a raise exposed smith as also a victim of karma the academy after all started out as a unionbusting organization he should have supported his fellow actors in contract negotiations yet smith had played the oscar game strictly according to the rules by starring in concussion it was a medical drama about a controversial subject written and directed by a conscientious filmmaker in which smith had to change his appearance and his accentpure oscar bait if sandra bullock was nominated and won for the blind side a sappy football drama smith deserved at least a nomination for a serious one if will smith who has been loyal to hollywoods way of doing thingsloyal to a faultcant get a nomination what chance did ryan coogler have he made a good sports drama a big film that made money and that critics liked the academy told him only sylvester stallone deserved recognition for it the same way no one but four white screenwriters were recognized for straight outta compton the first half generates excitement as it explores teenage life in 1980s compton and brings the group together then f gary grays biopic switches gears and splits eazye jason mitchell dr dre corey hawkins and ice cube oshea jackson jr into a tripartite version of a hollywood seriouscomposer biopic like rhapsody in blue when nwa breaks up the film becomes morose bogged down in cameo parts recriminations

success as a businessman or ice cubes prodigiousness cubes dignity and conscience extend to the actor playing him oshea jackson jr his son in real life jackson the younger is a carbon copy of his father who makes him seem even greater than the original hes somehow more cube than cube christopher wallace jr set the precedent for this by playing biggie as a child in 2009s notorious a film that didnt get mentioned much in relation to straight outta compton which was treated as the first biopic to admit raps centrality to american culture maybe because it was from the west coast i used to be a movie theater projectionist and sometimes i have an anxiety dream that im back working in the booth i must have been anxious about seeing the hateful eight because the night before i saw it i had a booth dream in the dream different machines are in the booth with the two regular 35mm projectors two 16mm projectors set up next to two 70mm projectors the gauge tarantino used for the hateful eight these four new projectors crowding the boothtwo of them small and two hugeare old models battered and tarnished i ask the theater manager why theyre there he tells me the director of the movie were showing has made sections of the film in these three different gauges and the movie is to be projected that way this director has also specified what make and model of projector each reel must be shown on down to the year it was made as i begin to thread the first reel i see that the film is old and brittle and has turned pink from age it has many torn sprockets i examine it more closely and see its not a new movie at all but a western from the early 1960s by the director joseph m newman the manager tells me to get going but when i thread the projector i put a twist in the film which i notice after i start the movie i tell the manager its going to break and he says dont worry if it breaks well show an old cartoon there were stories in the news about projectionists flying to distant cities to work in booths for the hateful eight valiantly making sure the 70mm roadshow screenings went off without a hitch when i saw it in 70mm in the east village i was happy there werent any promos for tv shows before it or ads for soda or any trailers at allthey couldnt show them with a 70mm print if tarantino has done anything hes given us the experience of watching a new movie by itself on film without any extraneous crap beforehand to remind us that movies are part of a universe of media streaming elsewhere sitting in that theater watching the hateful eight put me in the hundredyear flow of people in big cities watching westerns in movie theaters dreaming of places without skyscrapers and subways the hateful eight is a reflective film in which the hawksian tarantino reevaluates the unfair comments he made about john ford when django came out maybe in rewatching some ford movies featuring john wayne in preparation for casting kurt russell in a role based on wayne and on the constructed authority wayne brought to his charactersan authority that is questioned and then eliminated in the hateful eight tarantino realized he has more in common with ford than he thought fordian reference abounds russell says thatll be the day like john wayne in the searchers tim roths character is named mobray after an actor in my darling clementine who like roth plays a part in a saloon the explanatory flashback subverts the narrative liberty valancestyle the films letter from abraham lincoln fords touchstone in american history proves to be false and dangerous but a beautiful story held till the end jennifer jason leigh spits on that letter she is the films destroyer a poisoner who exists to upend all the stories men tell each other to justify their violence a kali figure of the cinema leighs daisy domergue with matted hair and blood in her eyes fights her captivity with a noose around her neck and the severed arm of russells bounty hunterthe arm of the lawdangling from her chains i saw the hateful eight while the occupation of the national wildlife refuge was happening in oregon malheur close to hateful in french was a western too with a plot like tarantinos holed up in the middle of nowhere in winter a group of armed men telling each other bedtime stories about the constitution threatened to make a bloody mess outside the nation tore itself apart because a large segment of the population refused to give up old myths the hateful eight is tarantinos most timely film swinging hard for the visionary and missing alejandro gonzález iñárittus revenant combines andrei rublev with apocalypse now and saving private ryan unfurling winter panoramas in natural light and adding cgi animals the heart of the film the section in which glass leonardo dicaprio meets hikuc arthur redcloud after the buffalo stampede rises above iñárittus gory conception for a moment before ending in a hanging and a rape because if we forget this films theme for a second we will be snapped back into it as punishment for daydreaming the rest is a slog klondike kat crossed with a matthew barney film dominated by tom hardys distractingentertaining appalachian accent one thing is certain iñárittu has finally solved the problem of how to film a realistic bear fight the next cinematic problem he should tackle is screenwriting tinkertoys in a landscape thats like a painting by yves tanguy while in the foreground the ed roth car from the cover of the birthday partys junk yard album drives by at 150 miles an hour the most cartoonish film in a year of films like warner brothers cartoons is also one of the best how mad max fury road is that oneinathousand reboot that will greenlight even more reboots none of which will justify its existence like this one charlize theron as a onearmed truck driver in postapocalyptic australia wears black grease as sunscreen under a buzzcut a look sufficiently removed from her usual perfumead glamour which is displaced onto the women she is rescuing tom hardy is better muttering than pontificating like he did in the revenant the entire cast seems handpicked for a kind of cinematic glory that has little to do with what goes on in other blockbusters george miller has done well to stay away from hollywood and to switch from making animated movies to liveaction ones miller also remembered to make the film directly about things not all subtext begging for explication the scarcity of water oil wars the arms trade and female emancipation jostle for space with the customized vehicles coming in and out of focus with the blitz but when it comes to political subtext it must be acknowledged that immortan joes demise was predictable from his water distribution method pouring thousands of gallons of water on peoples heads from a great height is not the best way to keep them pacified better to sell it to them in plastic bottles for 99 cents each like j j abramss star trek reboots his new star wars seems crowdsourced and easy to forget an app you just closed kylo rens mask sticks in my mind because he doesnt need it and wears it anyway hes not a disfigured monster like darth vader hes handsome adam driver dressing up as grandpa on halloween preprogrammed for redemption hes not evil hes just young spotlight joins the thin ranks of good contemporary boston films mystic river the fighter and does them one better by offering an explanation for the dark cloud that hangs over the place like the devil looms over the town in murnaus faust set in 2001 during the time of the boston globes exposé of pedophile priests in the catholic church spotlight glorifies investigative journalism and newspaper publishing for a world without newsprint the film is spare and didactic an instructional film explaining a disappearing profession the editors and reporters in the film are saints whose personal lives are secondary to their work and the boston they work in is institutionally corruptcops and the courts stand between them and the truth as much as the church does it captures an essential truth about boston that feeling of drabness mixed with hostility and peculiarity anyone that who has ever had to knock on a strangers door in that town has felt the key scene in this regard is the one in which rachel mcadams stands at the front door of a disgraced priest who happily admits to his crimes while his sister barks and snipes shooing mcadams off im sure that woman puts an orange traffic cone in her parking space in may dalton trumbo bryan cranston the blacklisted screenwriter at the center of this earnestfrantic biopic was prosoviet and a member of the cpusa his politics formed during the depression called before huac in 1947 he served time in jail for refusing to name names and was denied work by the studios after prison he wrote films under pseudonyms including gun crazy and won oscars for two of them one was roman holidayyes roman holiday was written by a commie he couldnt publicly accept or acknowledge his awards until after kirk douglas and otto preminger broke the blacklist in 1960 by giving him screen credit on spartacus and exodus  as a truelife version of hail caesar that features many actors familiar from coen brothers movies trumbo hams up the blacklist the director jay roach directed the austin powers and fockers movies and trumbo gets over its awkwardness by focusing on the mechanics of screenwriting under duress which roach marvels at here is a screenwriter willing to risk everything including his family to write b movies for low pay under a pseudonym without compromising his politics after austin powers in goldmember that point of view makes sense actors play real hollywood figures with varying degrees of success christian berkel who plays otto preminger captures his essence turning the combative auteur into a sly interloper popping up in highland park with mordant viennese panache trumbo leaves the impression that the 50s worked out for everybody in the end except for poor louis c k as a leftwing screenwriter who smoked too much also set in the babyboomer heaven of the 1950s and early 60s bridge of spies presents the cold war as genteel and humane compared to the present war on terror tom hanks a highpowered lawyer but also a middleclass everyman proves that making deals with our enemies is a better solution than building walls or dropping bombs retrofitting the cold war for the end of the obama era bridge of spies combines the negotiation of international agreements with a trumpist approach deals are best handled by private citizens who know better than government officials how to get whats best for the country today of course it is this businessman figure who wants to build a border wall a bellicose reversal of this films message the coen brothers cowrote it but spielbergs unwavering belief in american values prevents any cynicism from coming through at the same time the film is mature aware that hanks is aging and could die of pneumonia without his overcoat from saks fifth avenue the scene with hanks and mark rylance as a pensive soviet spy listening to a shostakovich piano concerto on a radio in a

understated among these films a subtle tribute to the medium best suited for the intimacy of furtive glances and hushed conversations the film is a triumph of art direction and wardrobe a seductive

Apr 16 2018,positive, kachunk kachunk kachunck back in 1985 the mad max trilogy unceremoniously sputtered to an anticlimactic halt rather than going out on a furious nitroboosted blast that tepid finale beyond thunderdome would become the postapocalyptic outback series weak link an unsatisfactory follow up to its crowning production that film the road warrior 1981 not only elevated mel gibson to bankable star status in hollywood it seamlessly spun together an odd olio of diverse genres without faltering into camp and boasted some of the greatest realaction car stunts recorded on film what director george miller and gibson revved up was an instant cult classic a box office smash it covered its budget in the us in one week and a cando mashup from down under that would become a model that many would try to copy but few could emulate with mad max fury road released may 15 the series is back on track and boldly so it took decades to get here but its well worth the wait something well oiled in lineage and ready to sear into the minds of a new generation of thrillinjected converts something of a different texture less polished and more gritty mad max was conceived out of the opec oil crisis in the mid70s and the demented juices of wes craven and tobe hooper poetically subversive the film became a political incineration of glut and the virtuous notion of humanity as inherently good as few stuck their necks out for their fellow man as civilization slowly imploded one subtle key ingredient that helped make mad max and the road warrior remain so indelible over time was their pointedly baroque scores composed by brian may not to be confused with the renowned guitarist from queen that effortlessly flowed with the action underscoring it and heightening moments of tension with emphatic fistpumping punctuation their classic composition has stood the test of time for thunderdome which costarred pop icon tina turner as the malevolent overseer of a desert stranded bastion of humanity miller went with the diva and a score that sorely missed mays deft touch in resurrecting the franchise miller knew that repartnering with gibson would not be possible as max was conceived and gestated as something akin to james bond or tarzan an ageless warrior battling archvillains on a landscape changed only by the shifting sands of the zeitgeist of the moment jettisoned too in the new millennia recreation is the whole oil grab notion tilled under by todays alternative energy efforts and climate change fears had maxs seminal inception been in the now one could almost imagine the lord humongous battle axe in hand lording over a vast desert wasteland covered by a sheet of solar panels harnessed to charge ghoulishly trickedout electric v8s in the new mad max fury road the petrol so precious in the road warrior seems relatively abundant by comparison  and bullets too out in the desert sea patrolled by clans of punkedout marauders theres the bullet farm and gas town a massive refinery that belches evil carbon clouds into the sky whats scarce in the 2015 max is water green space and nubile women who can bear children those that can are stunning to behold in thin gauze that might drive some teenage boys wild as theyre played by victorias secret models or the progeny of rock n roll royalty  lenny kravitzs daughter zoë and elvis presleys granddaughter riley keough we never get to go to the bullet farm or gas town they remain distant images on the red horizon as furiosa charlize theron charged with a shoppingraid mission by fury roads resident baddie immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne so unforgettable as the toecutter in the original mad max and downright outlandish here looking like a morlock on steroids aka dad probably because he holds the keys to all the babes chastity belts decides to go off course on a little joy ride this doesnt bode well with joe the bullet farmer richard carter or any of the other bloodthirsty factions suddenly on the tail of furiosa and her war tanker loaded with live flesh and hope where is the new max in all this yes tom hardy the guy who was a sheer menace as bane in the dark knight rises and so thespian in locke makes a fine max hes the draw but this is really therons film her furiosa an enhanced 20 version of the woman warrior from the road warrior comes fully imbued with the resolve and maternal sensibilities of sigourney weavers ripley from the alien franchise part cyborg and always thinking ahead she drives the film while keaysbyrne gobbles up chunks of the screen time too that main guy listed up in the title hes just along for the ride  and what a ride it is when we first meet max hes barely finished eating a two headed gecko  raw  before being picked off by a detachment of joes albino tweekers and harnessed as a sack of blood mainlined into the arteries of the chosen war boys  fanatic and finely conditioned malevolents who like many of todays indoctrinates of terror are willing to die for a greater cause without understanding the ramifications of the chess game being played above their heads fury road is one long chase sequence that borrows much from the road warrior the music box nostalgically symbolizing innocence a faulty sawedoff shot gun and a resilient tanker fortified in barbwire and under siege from a limitless foe but also puts its own stamp on the series without tipping it over miller who has made 10 features  four maxes two happy feet and a babe  had been incubating the project for a decade and a half his diligent care and commitment to the perfect shot and liveaction stunt work  not cgi enhanced zaniness though there is some like the fast and furious films  is aesthetically evident and underscored by the furious yet fluid editing as far as chase scenes go this is as close to william friedkin making the french connection or to live and die in la on the really did that scale as one might see in their lifetime these days the thrill per second ratio is off the charts not to mention a tribe of women called the vuvalini and a monster rock show that follows joes every move some might be well within their purview to call fury road bombastic but none in their right mind could ever call it dull whether miller set out to make fury road as an ecopro message green space is nonexistent or not the articulation of oppression especially when it comes to the indentured women assigned for breeding and feeding is squarely there and timely hardy and theron play off each other beautifully too if theres any throttle back to fury road its that the new max lacks soul and purpose gibsons warrior of the wasteland was something you could sink your teeth into and feel the man lost his wife and child and thats what pushed him over to the edge of moral ambiguity  think clint eastwoods man with no name it was visceral and real here hardys max is just a survivor haunted by the past in a way that feels halfhearted blanched and doesnt fuel the character its inconsequential however as fury road is all about adrenaline and forward motion theres never any let up from the get go before max can utter his first words hes already been snatched shackled baneesque face plate and all and mounted to the grill of a muscle car with an iv running to his blood needy host driving the jalopy of mayhem hot after furiosa in the end miller has done it and done it righteously  reimagining a sturdy franchise and living up to the original while kicking the tired reboot to the curb fury road is rife with activity and fertile with ideas rumor has it theres two

Mar 2 2018,positive,charlize theron as furiosa is freaking amazing in this film she fights shes badass shes so great
Dec 2 2017,positive, directed by george miller starring tom hardy charlize theron nicholas hoult hugh keaysbyrne rosie huntingtonwhitely nathan jones megan gale zoe kravitz riley keough josh helman jennifer hagan abbey lee kershaw courtney easton in a stark desert landscape where humanity is broken two rebels just might be able to restore order max a man of action and of few words and furiosa a woman of action who is looking to make it back to her childhood homeland when george miller said that mad max fury road would be a twohour long car chase he wasnt lying there are maybe three or four moments serving as downtime between action sequences allowing miller to further the plot which is actually quite fun and doesnt bog down the exhilarating road rage and develop his characters the ratio of action to story is still intentionally onesided but whats most remarkable is that not a second of mad max fury road is wasted or feels superfluous its a rollercoaster ride from the very start and is destined to be remembered not just as a successful resurrection of the mad max franchise there hasnt been an entry in 30 years but one of the most unique blockbuster films in recent memory in an age where cgi and computer effects dominate the presentation of these hollywood epics mad max fury road takes a risky approach for the modern era by using practical effects as a matter of fact over 80 of the movie uses practical effects and it shows theres an early scene where immortan joe a tyrannical leader of a wasteland citadel played by hugh keaysbyrne is being fitted with his war armor and its impossible to not notice disgusting lumps severely unhealthy skin conditions and more the scene only lasts about 10 seconds but is enough to showcase that some serious work went into the costume and makeup effects and leave the impression that the rest of the movie is going to be one hell of a visual treat undoubtedly people are coming for the carmageddon chaos but the design of mad max fury road oozes a personality that is often missing from hollywood blockbusters its evident that george miller is putting forth maximum effort into this production painting an unrestrained canvas of crazy for a wasteland the movie is filled with a wide array of colors whether it be on clothing armor vehicles and even flares instead of packing the movie with one type of enemy there is a variety to them and their tactics like dudes with flamethrowers attached to their guitars or dudes with poles rigged to their vehicles that vault them all over the skies the movie never sticks to our heroes battling one group for too long constantly shaking it up so each battle is free from repetition thanks to this very distinct and often ludicrous approach to the world building and characters by association the frantic and chaotic chase sequences feel well mad even though admittedly some of the action gets so wild it can become slightly incoherent i still have no idea exactly how the villain met his demise what is going on is ridiculously ambitious coming across as a spectacle that needs to be witnessed the violence is also shot from a healthy amount of angles distance shots closeups firstperson shots and even some beautiful shots off in the distance from the side making the cinematography of mad max fury road incredibly tight no shortcuts or tricks were taken to make filming the carnage easy resulting in something that is not only intense but marvelous to ogle normally i dont advocate 3d but george miller definitely makes good use of it here to the point where it actually enhances the experience theres something about seeing pounds of dirt bounce up in your face and desert heat radiating off the screen that surprisingly works without interfering with the movie there is also a moneyshot towards the end when so much destruction is flying at your face you may hit the deck out of instinct normally 3d just feels there or isnt very noticeable but here it becomes another part of a fantastic whole it also helps that tom hardy makes for a pretty good max that is able to capture his very guarded personality and mental struggles of coming to terms with the death of his family there will be some diehard fans that will always prefer mel gibson but it cant be denied that tom hardy delivers in the role the supporting cast is also easy to like and filled with quirky characters like nux nicholas hoult who will do anything to impress his comically overthetop villainous leader immortan joe charlize theron also gives a fine performance as furiousa the battle hardened rebel smuggling out joes breeders in hopes of finding sanctuary for everyone back in her homeland she sells the hell out of the role with her shaven head and generally looks like a total badass amongst all of the mayhem it also must be noted that during the brief instances of peace all of our protagonists receive some minor character development and are all brought together by a common theme of redemption thats not to say the story is high art but when there are motives driving the characters in their action sequences everything comes much more alive and is easier to get lost in even the breeders being carried have their moments to shine when they easily could have been relegated to the eyecandy that they initially appear to be while i would say that mad max fury road is readily accessible to those not familiar with the franchise the selfcontained story can get a little confusing at times its not surprising because the original cut was over two hours meaning that more of the exposition and plot details are axed but its still frustrating when some minor things get a little lost in the shuffle in the end its not too bothersome considering the amount of satisfaction you will get from the wild ride but it still exists as a minor problem before closing this out it also needs to be mentioned that the sound design mixing and soundtrack for mad max fury road are intense upping the intensity of every single beat of action there seems to be a running theme where trailers will use the best piece of music for the film in the trailer but not actually have it in the movie that isnt the case here as the heartpounding battle music from the trailer kicks in numerous times the soundtrack also feels incredibly unique when you have heavy metal blaring from flamethrower guitars and drums pounding from battlecriers blasting in conjunction with the original music everything about mad max fury road comes across as the antithesis to the modern blockbuster it is a bloody violent rrated action flick using the cinematic tricks of yesteryear to create something that can fit in wonderfully alongside what has now been accepted as the standard mad max fury road is that rare successful franchise resurrection it is an 80s action film with the budget of a modern era film and cinematography so mindblowing it feels as if it was filmed with technology from the future
Oct 17 2017,positive, visually the film is astonishing
Sep 20 2017,positive, also set in a dsytopian world fury road sees furiosa on the run from tyrant immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne after she takes away his prized possessions  five young women who function as breeders of his army fans of the original mad max movies might feel cheated that max tom hardy has become a bystander in his own movie but if its pure adrenaline they miss theres nothing to worry about
Aug 22 2017,positive,mad maxs visual intelligence and wit vastly outweigh its concessions to the genre
Aug 16 2017,positive,mad max fury road is the perfect chick flick for the discerning viewer who prefers her protagonist to be more ellen ripley than a musical charlies angel
Aug 16 2017,positive,  thanks for reading the tyee today  we hope this article added to your day in some way our team of independent journalists takes pride in doing indepth reporting and taking time to get it right   were able to focus our attention on publishing impactful journalism in the public interest and publish it for free for all to read because we have the support of tyee builders tyee builders are readers who contribute a bit of money  at a level and frequency of their choice  to support our editorial budget   this core of supporters  making up about 1 to 2 per cent of our daily readership  enables us to pay our writers keep our articles free and open to all and not bombard our readers with annoying ads while you try to read   instead of focusing on what kind of articles will attract the most advertising dollars we can spend time devoted to researching and writing stories that our readers find most valuable and make the most positive impact in our region   you made it all the way through the article  i hope that means you liked it or if not liked it gleaned some useful information from it tyee articles are known for being quite lengthy so we appreciate when people spend some quality time with our work   listen ill get to the point  the article you just read was made possible because our nonprofit newsroom was able to pay a talented journalist to research and write it and we can only afford to do that because of our business model which relies on a certain percentage of our readers signing up for our paid membership program called tyee builders   the traditional business model for journalism in canada has been completely disrupted and were witnessing a slow collapse as corporate newsrooms buy up distressed publications lay people off and suck the value out of them before declaring bankruptcy and it doesnt help that tech giant meta has blocked canadian news on their facebook and instagram platforms   between 1 to 2 per cent of people who visit the tyee contribute financially but amazingly that small percentage is enough to fund half of our overall budget and it means we can operate without a paywall too 1 per cent of people giving means 99 per cent of people get access to quality factbased journalism from a talented team of journalists who live and work in bc alberta and across canada we think thats pretty remarkable  its a good sign when you bump into a couple of people you know who are just exiting the film that you are about to see its an even better sign when those people say i wish i was you seeing it again for the first time so it was with mad max fury road director george millers robust reboot opened in wide release this previous week already the critics are frothing with praise and the plebs are lining up en masse but is the hype all gunning engines and spinning wheels or is there real power beneath the hood of this hot rod for anyone who came of age during the original trilogy of mad max the road warrior and beyond thunderdome a holy set list on constant repeat at video parties in the 1980s fury road is a welcome addition while the original conceit of the mad max universe is maintained the new film surpasses its origins and offers up a brand new postapocalyptic funhouse ride with a surprisingly thoughtful subtext in a world that has fallen into chaos and ruination humans have descended to little more than a pack of wild dogs savaging what is left of the place and then turning on each other in snarling snapping frenzy resources  gas water and food  are controlled by the powerful through ritualized violence and constant threat watching the film one occasionally has the sinking feeling that were not all that far from removed from this fictional place water is doled out in measured doses and the population is imprisoned by desperation and need it looks a lot like current day california but put those thoughts out of your mind for the moment youre here for some escapism correct do not fear the film transports quite unlike any other action opus released this year indeed there is nothing quite like a good oldfashioned science fiction dystopia to take away your worries about doing your taxes or going to the dentist but for all its hammer and tongs approach the film is curiously gentle in some ways scene changes are denoted by a fade to black and silence is used to great effect some of the most powerful moments take place in stillness when humanitys dire state is sketched out underneath an impassive heaven god is long gone and all thats left is brute survival the centre of the film is anchored by two oddly calm performances tom hardy who spent another film messing about in cars in locke plays the titular max ptsd flashbacks have rendered him halfmad and his introduction in the film plays like a gothic nightmare of dead little girls and disembodied voices pity poor max he is truly lost in the wilderness of his own mind wandering and alone in a base rumble he sketches out the reality of the universe that he occupies as the world fell each of us in our own way was broken it was hard to know who was more crazy  me or everyone else the other pillar of the film is that of imperator furiosa played by the statuesque charlize theron with a metal arm and a coolly raging gaze furiosa is a driver and a soldier she is more than maxs equal in strength and tenacity unlike her male counterpart she has the courage of her convictions and an indomitable reserve of hope embodied in her memories of childhood spent in the green place  a lost paradise governed by women filled with plants and life our initial introduction to both these characters is brusque and peremptory almost before were ready we enter the wasteland hotly pursued by a posse of soupedup vehicular maniacs the film largely resembles one of ed big daddy roths ratfink cartoons come to wild life this aesthetic is carried throughout not just in the design of the cars and trucks bristling with sharpened spikes like so many fast moving sea urchins but also in the people themselves pinioned pierced and festooned in face and body cheeks and mouths slit wide and then stapled shut they too resemble assemblages of bits and parts repurposed and collaged together for maximum threat and hostility in his attention to detail miller brings the goods in ripe often overflowing abundance rich thick rococo embellishment abounds lavished on like heavy icing on an overstuffed cake it is luxuriant generous and occasionally bonkers there is so much on display that the eye often struggles to keep up this is a film that will no doubt keep fan boys and girls marvelling over the care and time allocated towards creating a fully realized world but the filmmaker doesnt let detail clog the story  the thing moves like it was on fire caught and caged within the first 10 minutes of the story maxs wild bid for freedom functions as fullon immersion in the world of the film his prison is a stone citadel overseen by a dictator named immortan joe played by hugh keaysbyrne in a nice nod to the original film joe is a grotesquery that puts darth vader to shame with his powdered pustuleridden body kohlringed eyes and breathing apparatus that resembled an oldfashioned bellows his control over the ragged populace is kept in place by an army of soldiers called the war boys  a collection of young white men bubbling with tumours who derive their allegiance to their leader from the idea that death in battle will result in life everlasting in valhalla a young war boy named nux played by nicholas hoult provides much of this backstory at least i think that he does the speed with which he describes his society is sometimes hard to understand with everyone yelling on about valor victory and glory in australian accents but the basic gist is that whoever controls the resources controls the power and so it is here as well precious water pumped from an underground aquifer is measured out just enough to keep the people in check old immortan puts the dick in dictator in other classic ways maintaining his lineage on the backs of a harem of beautiful young women that he keeps stowed away in an underground vault like mormon wives the women are kept impregnated and under tight control breeding stock for the continuation of male power let me take a brief moment here to marvel at the mens rights groups who are calling for a boycott of the film based on the idea that it is a femaleled story one wag called it a trojan horse feminist film feel free to scratch your head a little bit about this who would you relate to here if its some old white dude with a monster truck and a bevy of aryan followers you might want to renew your white power membership along with your mens rights card but back to the story at hand the action kicks off when the wives stage a jailbreak helped along by furiosa and her awesome truck the war rig a majestic creature bedecked and festooned with weapons of every stripe and powered by mothers milk i kid you not  breast milk is at the heart of this massive beast of a vehicle but before you get stuck pondering such curious inclusions the plot picks you up by the scruff of the neck and drags you along the chase is on and really the chase never stops it just keeps going getting bigger wilder and more gonzo cuckoo picking up speed until it rockets into your gut and brain but despite the velocity with which the action takes place the film maintains an internal narrative drive that never falters namely that we want these women and their unborn children to escape the clutches of the monster that would rape and imprison them as the runaway women streak across the desert joe and his army of followers strap max to the front of a moving vehicle and take off after them other male tribes from gas town and the bullet farm respectively come to immortan joes aid these groups are presided over by male leaders with elephantiasis prosthetic noses and various other conditions the men arent looking so good this is in stark contrast to the women who are sheathed in diaphanous muslin glossy with good health and pampering indeed our first extended look at these babes finds them watering themselves down in the desert like they were on a vogue fashion shoot this posse of apocalyptic supermodels initially comes across as little more than pretty cattle but these women have grit and soon enough theyre fighting for their own emancipation and freedom they start by cutting off their chastity belts and leaving them by the side of the road the underground railroad theme of liberating folk from sexual slavery is implicit but like much of the film it is only one more note in the grand wagnerian thunder simply add it to score like the trumpet blasts that mark the entrance of the valkyries and let this rock opera roar götterdämmerung and away we go hacking shooting slicing and dicing in a cacophony of screaming engines and bodies flying through the air like bits of ragged confetti it is a veritable feast of oldfashioned ultra violence add in lighting sandstorms leapfrogging motorcyclists flameshooting guitarists or best yet the vuvalini a band of old lady bikers who maintain gardens in their handbags and fight like ancient wrinkly ninjas any film that makes a gang of weathered old grandmas into a super heroic fighting force has my full support is this film hysterical certainly it is good dumb fun yes indeed but there is something more than just another science fiction romp as curious as it may seem you care that these characters survive in the face of the insanely ridiculous odds that are ranged against them here is where the film sets itself apart from the rest of the pack it is equitable and fair in a way that few other action films are both men and women are given the scope to carve out their characters in the fullest spectrum of light and dark i had every intention of liking the film but this sense of justice made me love it tom hardy an actor of some power supports the action using his physical heft and his voice a velvety cattongued thing that scratches and purrs to great effect theron embodies her own brand of heroic with solidity and strength whether she is smearing grease over her closecropped hair or saving max from certain death with her robot arm the pair is wellbalanced and you root for them to see themselves in each other in this the film is oddly romantic albeit of the doomed and desperate variety but as the men discover the love of a strong woman can make you a better man and an even better road warrior in the films penultimate scene when max finally tells furiosa his real name making low noises of alarm in his throat it is an act of bravery that surpasses hanging upside

Aug 10 2017,positive, this summers tomorrowland from disney and director brad bird and mad max fury road a reboot of the original mad max trilogy from the 1970s and 80s from australian director george miller go together better than you might think at first glance seeing them in tandem makes all the difference mad max fury road is the typical postapocalyptic dystopian flick with themes of hope and redemption and regeneration the lead characters are courageous violent fighters and hope is a mirage in tomorrowland the apocalypse is pending there is still time to change to do something the main characters have optimistic energy vision and willpower the only violence i recall is a bunch of humanlooking robots are destroyed in a shop fight tomorrowland stops the forward  and backward  thrust of the mad max gaggle of mashed up reconstituted vehicles dead in their desert tracks and seems to ask in a total undisney way arent you tired of all these mayhem and scorched earth survivalist movies do you really think these cataclysmic events are inevitable what about doing something to prevent these portent events in the first place how and who would do it the politicians corporations think again mad max fury road features charlize theron as imperator furiosa latin for furious commander a woman seeking redemption though from what we will have to wait for the sequel to learn she seems to be following the leader of a huge group of nuclear holocaust survivalists immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne but in their trek across a barren landscape she strikes her own course toward the green place where she was born hidden inside furiosas tanker are several women kind of like sister wives to the scarred leader joe they are breeders for his family a true despot joe realizes something is amiss and the caravan goes after her he controls everything at his headquarters the citadel especially water to keep the sick poor and damaged survivors at bay joes survivalists have captured max rockatansky tom hardy as a source of blood for nux nicholas hoult max and nux are bound so he can keep the supply of blood going and they take off in pursuit of furiosas rig too to make a long story shorter both max and nux join the women with joe and his minions in hot pursuit after making it through a narrow canyon passage arranged ahead of time by furiosa they encounter a group of older women a remnant protecting the desert of what used to be the green place  they decide to return together to joes citadel because it has water the oldest woman carries a bag with seeds in it one has taken root and a flash of green leaves is pushing through off the survivors go promising a sequel as the credits start to roll nothing about this story is tame it is filled with relentless nonstop action violence with a hint of humor the mutant blind rock singerflame thrower doof warrior iota who is strapped to one of joes lead vehicles with bungee cords looks like a leftover member of the motley crue it is so incongruous that all you can do is laugh there is mention of hope and redemption and lifegiving water here and there a priest friend wrote on facebook that mad max fury road is socially corrosive from beginning to end actually i think this is what the movie is about the consequences of uncaring socially corrosive behavior will lead to worldwide disaster the question is what do you do about it how do you restore the environment order and life itself it will take a spectacular cinematic dystopian revolution  at least this is where mad max leaves us as a sequel or sequels is surely coming  but so what weve seen it all before just packaged differently children are made to kill children in the hunger games the divergent franchise to me is basically the same story we can perhaps look to the giver and fahrenheit 451 as the source of the postapocalyptic genre in fiction and movies like the omega man in 1971 hollywood keeps pumping out these movies many based on popular novels for new generations to flock to theaters to see only to leave and wait for the next one televisions fascination with the vampire subgenre tells the same story the end is near and life after is going to be hell yes there are those spiritual and religious themes that we console ourselves with but then what although largely panned by critics ideologically i found tomorrowland to be a breath of fresh air amid the dystopian dust created by peatandrepeat movies both films are fantastical imaginings of future cataclysms to come one dark and the other much lighter but tomorrowland risks being different from all the other films in the genre because it appoints practically anoints those who can change the course of history go backward to 1964 young frank walker thomas robinson makes his way through the crowds at the new york worlds fair to the inventors pavilion he is carrying his invention a jetpack made from a vacuum cleaner to enter a contest will his invention help make the world a better place but the man in charge nix hugh laurie dismisses it because it is just for fun with no real purpose though he knows frank is a very smart kid instead he introduces frank to athena raffey cassidy who seems to be nixs daughter a disney version of nux in mad max frank is smitten and athena takes him on a tour of a place that exists in another dimension tomorrowland drawn from disney theme parks tomorrowland of course fast forward into the future but not too far and we meet casey newton played by britt robertson note the connection to the name newton who is very bright and dismayed at the bad news all around her the earth is a scary place it is decaying and the government is shutting down nasa where her father eddie tim mcgraw is an engineer britt seeks out frank george clooney now a recluse and when athena appears again they fight off some robots and try to save both tomorrowland and the earth tomorrowland makes a strong statement about setting aside politics and big profit corporations because of their failure to care for the earth indeed their record of overconsuming and destroying resources and wants to encourage us to use our imaginations to solve the worlds problems  to let loose the creative energy of artists and scientists to change the inevitable doom that pop culture continually regurgitates for us the evening news local or national report on environmental stories often if we are paying attention enough to notice and ask questions or if we can connect the dots from art and current events that pope francis lays out for us in his encyclical laudato si on care for our common home perhaps we can join the dreamers artists scientists and people of good will to make the changes needed to nurture and preserve the earth for everyones benefit not just the rich and powerful so why are we compelled to watch disaster as entertainment but as some do refuse to acknowledge the human element to climate change and the consequences of scorched earth human activity unfolding in front of us mad max fury road and films like it are actually prophetic tomorrowland takes the bold step of telling us directly what we can do because as loud and explosive as these other films are we dont seem able to see hear or understand maybe this is why hollywood keeps making them regardless are we not entertained as maximus russell crowe yells to the crowd in ridley scotts 2000 gladiator  as far as the american film industry and the world audience go isnt this all that really matters for mindful viewers and creative people of good will i hope not
Jun 27 2017,positive, perhaps most insane of all its as close to a futuristic feminist manifesto as any movie ive ever seen the possible exception being volker schlondorffs underappreciated the handmaids tale the credit goes to george miller who invented the mad max franchise almost 40 years ago that particular max was played with surly charisma and matineeidol good looks by mel gibson aside from a carstrewn vision of a postapocalyptic future the maxs have almost nothing in common  no more say than roger moore and daniel craig as 007 the outline is vaguely the same but everything else is different the new movie hits the ground running in a briefly subdued introduction max tom hardy munches on a twoheaded lizard and mutters my world is made of fire and blood it was hard to know who was crazier  me or everyone else within minutes the smart money is on everyone else  max runs afoul of a tribe of albino baldies who control the water in this dehydrated dystopia their leader is immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne toecutter in the original movies   a brute whose human parts are barely held together by hieronymus boschlike prosthetics these war boys as theyre known are experts at using other humans as commodities  a dozen or more women are hooked up to giant pumps that continuously extract their breast milk  max himself is trussed up as a human blood bag attached to joes sickly son nux nicholas hoult having sketched out the bare essentials miller then sends us on a nonstop twohour chase thats made all the more stunning by the filmmakers decision to eschew cgi effects as much as possible so yes those are stuntmen engineering those incredible smashups riding motorbikes down impossible inclines or dangling over their quarry like demented escapees from cirque de soleil and that quarry is a onetime loyalist named imperator furiosa charlize theron still gorgeous despite her shaved head and robotic arm on a seemingly routine petrol run shes gone rogue making off with joes most precious possessions they are a quintet of scantily clad lovelies known as breeders who apparently survived the apocalypse by hiding out in a victorias secret store furiosa has vague prewar boys memories of a green place where she and her mother lived peacefully before being kidnapped she intends to bring the breeders there and max whos graduated from blood bag to hood ornament ends up on her side millers original mad max trilogy laid out the blueprint for countless futureset films that followed  here he outdoes himself ramping up the landscapes as much as the action  a mad dash through a crazyquilt rock formation suggests stagecoachs monument valley reimagined by a visionary lunatic a journey through a foggy quagmire seemingly inhabited by cronecrane mutants is eerily disturbing mad max fury road has all its teeth too  and then some because amidst all the sound and fury miller still made room for a human element saportareport founded in february 2009 is a trusted voice in metro atlanta through the years we have become atlantas authoritative civic website our readers are engaged in atlantas most pressing issues and want to hear directly from leading companies and nonprofits in the region we give those organizations a platform to share their messages and interact with informed atlantans

Jun 23 2017,positive, no movie has approached the postapocalyptic genre quite as definitively as george millers mad max series the australian directors vision of a desert wasteland where warlords battle for fuel has been so influential that it remains the gold standard for many fans and with good reason  the mad max films rank among the most bizarre imaginings of life after the fall of civilization the world of mad max is inventive violent and straightup weird its a place where gang leaders have cult followings the noise of revving engines is ever constant and characters have names like the lord humungus toecutter and toast the knowing no i am not kidding its also a world filmgoers havent seen since the release of the third film in the series beyond thunderdome in 1985 finally thirty years later we have a new entry mad max fury road it was worth the wait millers latest octanefueled adventure is a movie with a lot on its mind in addition to the wild costumes crazy vehicles and mindblowing effects the new film brings worldweary hero max rockatansky played by tom hardy taking over from mel gibson to the citadel an oasis of sorts ruled by the tyrannical immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne captured for use as a walking blood transfusion for joes warriors max escapes with imperator furiosa charlize theron the driver of one of joes tanker truck war rigs furiosa is also carrying a dangerous set of fellow escapees five young women rosie huntingtonwhiteley zoe kravitz riley keough abbey lee and courtney eaton whom joe has been using as his personal sex slaves the strongest parts of the mad max films have always been effects and production design and its thrilling to see miller working with a budget that fits the scope of his ambitions immortan joe and his army are pale cancerridden beings kept alive by complex sets of tubes and tanks the cars look like the results of a demolition derby in hell one even serves as a wall of amps for a mutant guitarist whose instrument doubles as a flamethrower again not kidding whats also impressive is millers ability to tell a clear story in the midst of nonstop action fury road is essentially a twohourlaong car chase but within it the characters their motivations and conflicts remain discernable and compelling keeping all of that straight in a world that feels so different from our own isnt easy to pull off  avengers age of ultron could barely manage it without the societal breakdown but this isnt just a movie about brooding wanderers and spectacular car crashes the women of fury road are the ones who get most of the attention and who are undeniably the heroes of the film they are tough and know how to take care of themselves but also represent their worlds best hope for change the film frequently juxtaposes the difference between their compassionate renewalfocused instincts and immortan joes destructive excess mad max fury road is a giddily entertaining film that sneaks in a progressive stance on womens rights whats more it does so in a way that serves the story and doesnt feel forced george miller has told a story that feels authentic to the world hes created but that also takes it in a new and fascinating direction its fantastic to have max rockatansky back on the road but its even better that his creator has done so with a greater purpose in mind we value your feedback on the articles we post please fill out the form below and a member of our online publication team will receive your message by submitting this form you consent to your comment being featured in our letters section   please do not include any nontext characters such as emojis or other nonstandard content into your submission  it may cause errors in submitting the form  thanks
Jun 1 2017,positive, in some ways fury road is everything i expected it is often cacophonous in its engine roar and explosive well fury it is loud and intense but these things arent enough now in the twodecadesplus aftermath of terminator 2 judgment day and the steadily escalating summer tentpoles that have followed i feel desensitized to the computergenerated and often sterile destruction thats defined the arena these kinds of movies have operated in its not that i dont enjoy them but my capacity for surprise is difficult to stir mad max fury road is ostensibly a sequel to the original 1979 film and its two followups but it appears free of much in the way of obligations to fiction or canon you dont need to have seen any of them to grok the premise of this new film  that human nature along with a helping of postpeak oil and weapons of mass destruction has poisoned the world leaving an archetypal postapocalypse in its wake food is scarce water is scarcer and gasoline and the juryrigged vehicles that require it rule everything the titular max tom hardy is a nomad survivor living in the wasteland but the film doesnt mince words or script pages before hes captured and made a human blood bag for the minions of warlord immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne meanwhile imperator furiosa charlize theron immortan joes most accomplished field commander has betrayed him stealing away his wives and fleeing with a massive war rig max and furiosas paths collide and the two must work together to survive and escape joes nightmarish gasolinefueled army if this sounds insane thats because it is fury road spends scant few minutes establishing a hellscape full of war boys bullet farms and aqua cola and then lets it all go what follows is a nearly relentless onslaught of beautifully orchestrated chaos an artfully controlled explosion that erupts in waves over the course of 120 minutes an extended chase scene that spends only minutes here or there allowing you to catch your breath fury road diverges from any film being released this summer that might realistically be considered a peer or a competitor by virtue of its physical presence theres little in the way of computergenerated destruction to be found here outside of one particular sequence instead director george miller has captured some of the most incredible practical stuntwork ive ever seen massive kitbashed vehicles smash against each other in a film that is essentially one long chase scene fury road offers a stark limited color palette filtered through endless dunes and sand that puts an emphasis on motion despite its consistently high level of carnage miller keeps a tight rein on everything avoiding the confusion and mess that plague so many summer event movies the chases and wrecks are artfully choreographed the constant motion tending toward the balletic despite the neartotal display of fire and rage on screen theres a perceptible sense of restraint at work in fury road its an intense violent movie but fury road never feels gratuitous with the gore instead trading blood and dismemberment for a wrenching sense of impact as bodies are thrown against or from the vehicles that dominate the proceedings that sense of economy extends to fury roads script as well miller and cowriters brendan mccarthy and nick lathouris have whittled it down to the barest essentials its a remarkable display of economy and despite some occasionally wooden dialogue that scratches at the edges of disbelief the story is a model of efficiency this is all the more impressive because of the subtly subversive heart of the film  that it frequently doesnt feel like maxs movie at all while max gets the voiceover to begin the film and his perspective establishes millers demented vision of the carpocalypse its furiosa who finds a character arc and a kind of heros journey even as max and furiosa work together theres a clear sense of purpose to therons performance thats missing in hardys ptsdplagued portrayal maxs violence feels unhinged like a force of nature but furiosa is the only character in the film that ever really finds catharsis that catharsis is contagious fury road is a shark constantly moving stripped down to the most basic powerful elements needed to achieve its goals despite its bigbudget trappings and wide release theres a real sense of independence and auteurship on display an energy ferocity and fearlessness that this kind of film so rarely sees occasionally we get a summer movie that has a chance to change things to change the conversation movies like 28 days later or the raid fury road belongs in that conversation and sits next to them as something made to knock everything else on its ass
Apr 26 2017,positive, yes i know that cannes is reckoned a citadel of capitalc cinemah and yes i know that its famous for premiering art movies from all over the world so it may sound a bit odd when i tell you that one of the best films showing heremaybe even the bestis a hollywood action movie thats opening tomorrow in the us but im just back from this morning screening of mad max fury road by the veteran australian director george miller and i can only say that its one of the purest pieces of filmmaking virtuosity youll see anywhere set in a postapocalyptic world run by thuggish armies it stars tom hardy and a superb charlize theron as two toughbuthonorable renegades trying to escape along with a group of young women whove been held as slaves thats the whole plot which is basically an excuse for long chaseandbattle sequences in trucks cars tanks and motorbikes across inhospitable landscapes tinged gold or blue this buzzsaw of action scenes is so dazzlingly original that it makes your dark knight avengers and spider man showdowns look trite dull and unimaginative unlike them miller made this stuff up rather than taking it from comic books normally when this kind of populist crowdpleaser plays at canneslike pirates of the caribbean or indiana jonesits showered with boos from an audience that thinks of it as the embodiment of evil here viewers not only applauded at the end but even during the movie each time a bravura sequence came to an end one famous critic even declared it the best movie ever made even if you dont normally like action pictures mad max will astound you its a shame its not in competition i can almost imagine the juryheaded by the coen brothers who know good directinggiving it the palme dor but only almost this is cannes after all and it is the enduring genius of cannes that it is always the samecrowds thronging the croisette to get a glimpse of the stars enormous billboards plugging movies youll never hear of again tv cameras pushing into your face after screenings to get your reactionyet it somehow manages to make every year feel different one small way is with the official satchel they give everyone whos part of the festival its omnipresence makes it one of the years trademarkssometimes unhappily so when the design is some shiny white plastic that looks like gogo boots from the sixties the 2015 version is a real keeper it looks like a classic childs schoolbag but in bright blueas if it had been designed by wes anderson civilians can see or even buy it here take the visibility of women last year the festival was voluminously thumped for the absence of female filmmakersso voilàthis years opening night film standing tall wasnt merely made by french actress emmanuelle bercot but the red carpet was pointedly dominated by women natalie portman whos making her directorial debut julianne moore naomi watts lupita nyongo chinese stars fan bingbing and angelababy ruling the stairway to the palais was catherine deneuve who 71 years old and still starring in films may be the closest thing there is to the queen of france shes essentially playing the soul of france itself in bercots movie which starts off looking like a gritty movie about a troubled young manplayed by charismatic newcomer rod paradot who resembles a young leonardo dicapriobut winds up being hymn of praise to the benevolent french social system deneuve plays a judge who no matter how often he acts crazy or violent  hes a kid stuck on fury roadstill tries to see his best side and labors to save him with help from a social worker played by the french sean penn benoît magimel naturally she does just as naturally it was adored by the french audience as for the rest of the world we snickered at the gallic amourpropre while admitting that by the standards of the famously dreadful openingnight fare at canneslast may was the risible grace of monacoit was pretty good and people are saying that paradot is a real discovery a more important discovery is that film is globalizing even faster than you ever imagined just as hollywood movies are now made with foreign audiences in mindmeaning more action and less dialogueso directors from outside the us are learning that its hard to sell a film abroad in their own language with homegrown stars this years competition includes two movies from italy one from greece and one from norway and what all four of their hot filmmakers have in common is that theyre working in english with stars you know from hollywood last night was the first of them tale of tales one of the rare movies nowadays that tries to capture the primal feeling of real fairy tales rather than do a wisedup riff on them working from a classic book of fairy tales filmmaker matteo garrone interweaves three stories about royaltyone about an overbearing queen salma hayek wholl do anything to have a baby another about a womanizing king vincent cassel who unwittingly tries to seduce a crone and yet another about a ruler toby jones so obsessed with fleas that he marries his daughter off to an ogre while the movie has an unsettlingly crosscultural vibeit looks like the characters should be speaking italian instead of englishgarrone has a wonderful visual sense and by the films end builds to some genuine and startling emotion its not a knockout like mad max fury road but heck it would be a lot to expect two great movies from a festival that as i write this isnt even 24 hours old by signing up you agree to our user agreement including the class action waiver and arbitration provisions our

Mar 7 2017,positive,the memories of the original mad max series are intact this is not more of the same fury road takes you down a different trail
Feb 28 2017,positive,it is a wild inventive barkingbonkers trumpet voluntary of wagnerian proportions and i loved it i loved it
Feb 24 2017,positive, anyone who is familiar with george millers mad max series must have been eagerly anticipating his latest as much as i have it has now been 30 years since we last saw max in his postapocalyptic desert world but it is almost as if no time has passed his world is still one of fire and blood as he describes it where the only ideal left to humanity is the will to survive although essentially one long chase sequence broken up into about four or five sections mad max fury road is an intense thrilling experience which is not only overflowing with action but also possesses a surprising amount of emotional depth where we get to know characters almost solely based on their lastsecond actions when everything is on the line with some fantastic performances by tom hardy and charlize theron among others and some fastpaced adrenalinepumping action sequences this is truly not a film to forgeta landmark moment in the world of action moviesmax is this futures version of the loner hero archetype a character that is most typically seen in classic westerns think clint eastwoods manwithnoname from the good the bad and the ugly the hero has a wounded past and mostly seeks to help himself but is suddenly thrusted into a situation where he has the ability and the choice to save the lives of othersfury road finds max hardy on a chase across the desert in a massive gasoline truck surrounded by stowaway wives of a psychopath named immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne and led by the fierce imperator furiosa theron with the intention of getting his wives back immortan joe sends his entire force after them what ensues is a dayslong chase across the desert where the horde of incoming men chase them on armored cars giant monster trucks and motorcycles armed with explosivesthough it may sound similar to the excessiveness of a franchise like transformers fury road is anything but despite the noise and cacophony it is actually quite tame especially since it could have also been extremely gory as well it may just be the most balanced mixture of insanity that i have ever witnessed on screensource warner bros picturesthe impeccably choreographed action sequences of fury road are sometimes so offthecharts with madness but then rather than beat the violence into submission miller backs off giving you a chance to breathe before once again diving back into it it is a roller coaster of ups and downs with the inbetween moments setting the tone for the wildness that is about to come by the final climactic battle the end result is one of nearperfect balance there is not even one too many action scenes or one too fewan emotionally impactful experiencein a movie that almost primarily exists for the purpose of pumping the adrenaline fury road actually has something deeper to say as well certain characters especially that of nux nicholas hoult have a remarkable arc from start to finish  rather than just existing as a pale brainwashed psychopath he eventually discovers that his life could be much more meaningful even the clear villain of the film immortan joe is not purely evil as he is only after furiosa in order to get his wives back whom he clearly has feelings forit is furiosa herself though who is the most impactful played with stern powerful confidence by theron furiosa is the breakout star of the film at times even more so than max her purpose and motivations are what drive her and more often than not she proves herself capable of taking care of businesssource warner bros picturesreally fury road does not have any shortage of strong female characters even the stowaway wives of immortan joe are able to show that they are much more than the damsels in distress that they first appear to be this is especially contrasted to the original mad max films which almost solely focused on the title character times have changed and with them have the roles for women even in a film such as this that most people would expect to be catered to a male audiencein the end though this is still maxs film and tom hardy is more than capable of taking up the role that mel gibson made famous in the original trilogy hardy even does his best to imitate the gruff subtle australian accent that gibson had in those films he is the strong silent type and often tells more with a single closeup stare than any amount of unnecessary words could do ive always found hardy to have a strong screen presence capable of playing roles as diverse as bane in the dark knight rises to the softspoken protagonist in last years underrated the drop even with an extensive and growing resume fury road is among his finest worka familiar dystopian worldthe world of fury road is one that fans of the series will be familiar with it is a mesh of cyberpunk weirdness where people talk in strange accents hold wild ideals and dress similar to how lady gaga might imagine the future to be it is similar in obscurity to the first three mad max films but it also at times stretches into parodysource warner bros picturesthis is not necessarily a bad thing though because it also laces the film with some muchneeded humor there is one scene in particular containing a firespewing guitar on the back of a truck that still makes me laugh miller doesnt overuse it either and only brings the humor at the most opportune moments when the audience is especially in need of some comic reliefconclusionif there is one thing that fury road has proven it is that action movies are nowhere near obsolete though this is the age of cgi it is also one where anything you imagine can be recreated on screen without the limits that past technology had miller has escalated his alreadyentertaining series into the present world and it is an experience that seems like the one he always wanted to create yet was never quite able to back in the 80s with the additions of charlize theron and tom hardy along with a welltalented supporting cast miller has truly knocked this one out of the

Oct 24 2016,positive, by now youve probably heard an incredible amount of hype for mad max fury road that its a nonstop car chase an unabashedly feminist thrill ride the bane of misogynists and a critics wet dream  with only two negative reviews out of 177 raves the film currently stands at a 99 percent approval rating on rotten tomatoes and pundits are already analyzing its chances for oscar success after its cannes premiere generated multiple rounds of spontaneous applause throughout the film so far the common theme among audience reactions seems to be my head exploded much has been made of the brilliance of director george millers decision to create such a highconcept action film but the mechanics of how hes done that are even more breathtaking than the fact he dared to do it at all miller has taken the physical tropes of action films and reimagined each one of them  instead of being a linear trajectory the standard highspeed chase becomes a complete catandmouse at one point when the pursuer abruptly becomes the pursued instead of having a single threat from overhead in the form of an aircraft miller engineers a jawdropping sequence involving tall swaying rigs on moving cars to create the harrowing chaotic effect of innumerable villains dropping out of the sky the chase ultimately extends off the ground and becomes the equivalent of the kind of threedimensional battle youd expect from star wars and instead of a standard fightontopofatrain scene miller deconstructs and uses every part of a moving semi while the camera moves in around and under highspeed vehicles with a fluidity that makes the cars themselves feel as though theyve become a physical landscape  logically a film this dedicated to action should have skimped on characterization instead fury road uses its lack of development for each character as an advantage rather than a hindrance we dont know why charlize therons furiosa is seeking redemption here in the desert but the glimpses we get of the wastelands starving society and immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne the despot shes been working for leave us with plenty of guesses we dont know the backstories of each of immortan joes escaped wives the sex slaves whose flight catalyzes the events of the film but at the same time we do because the story of violence against women is universal before they escape immortan joe keeps them in a large sealed vaultliterally a giant locked safe after they escape his sole concern is with recapturing the potential sons they carry inside of them which he refers to as his property the women themselves are utterly disposable at his handsthe urgency of their escape isnt just about escaping sexual subjugation but about regaining their agency from a man whom miller clearly intends to be read as a literal embodiment of patriarchal rule over all women we dont know why tom hardys max carries his own greek chorus credited as the accusing dead with him in his head but we see in every wince and flinch away from human contactwonderfully conveyed by hardy even though hes forced to wear an iron muzzle for the first 40 minutes of the filmthat his particular brand of madness arises from guilt and loss when they finally help one another to find the redemption theyve been seeking the emotional resonance feels like a more powerful climax for the film than any highcharged explosion could be  there is an incredible tenderness at the center of fury roadits two hours of action yes but its also two hours of characters protecting one another believing in one another and deciding to trust in one another because its the human thing to do we expect this kind of trust to be earned over time in the standard blockbuster but we dont expect it to be given on principle because characters are trying desperately to retain what makes them human its one of the most subtle elements of millers showdonttell structure and it makes an incredibly powerful impact  like the original mad max trilogy millers dystopia is drenched in political commentary but while the films feminism has recently taken center stage its environmentalism is far more stridentnot in the least because its message of a world ruined by hopeless dependence on oil comes just days after the us authorized the beginning of drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge a hotly debated issue thats been the center of four decades of controversy do not grow addicted to water immortan joe tells his parched people lest you start to resent its absence nothing will grow in oncelush spaces in the wasteland because immortan joe has pumped the water away from its sources and poisoned the soil through fracking fury road is so overtly moralistic on the subject of conservation that the urgency of the chase eventually seeps into a kind of metaphor for climate change in which humanity is racing barely ahead of its own environmental destruction yet as with all gaiacentric views of the world environmentalism and feminism go hand in hand the wastelands fabled green place is home to the clan of many mothers one of whom has patiently carried seeds with her for years in hopes that finally something will grow female solidarity is the only thing that can topple mad maxs patriarchy the endless reign of joe and his warboys our sons will not be warlords the escaped slaves write on the vault he locks them inalong with who killed the world therons furiosa is the most fully realized female action hero since ripley like ripley she carries herself with a deep wariness letting her actions speak for her and rarely giving into despair but unlike ripley she has aims of doing more than just surviving her choice to help free the slaves sets off a chain of events that can only end in death or regime change  at one point during mad max there are 12 women on screen and they all have speaking roles  none of them are talking about a man it shouldnt be groundbreaking for this many women to have roles in an action movie in 2015 but it is but fury road as with most of its themes is less concerned with preaching a philosophy of feminism to you than with letting the ideals of feminism speak for themselves in this narrative women arent expendable negligent plot devices theyre characters with just as much agency over the plot as any of the men  just as important is hardys choice to play max as a subtle quietly feminist hero max never objectifies the women hes with or views them as props for his own agenda he helps when hes asked to help and when he finally speaks for any length of time its not to take charge of a group thats floundering without his helpits to make a suggestion stand back and then let the group decide this view of what equality actually looks like in a film is rare enough but its even rarer to see it in this kind of genre material fury road passes the bechdel test of course it also passes the mako mori test on at least seven different counts mad max fury road leaves those mediocre measurements of gender representationwhich the vast majority of hollywood films never even attempt to passso far behind that it seems almost silly even to use them as yardsticks in the wake of the strength of fury roads narrative other films that have had this level of active female representation have been written off by critics either as being girly or as portraying those characters as weak but fury road is every inch the hightestosterone manly action movie of your dreams and even when they show weakness its female characters are still fully in charge of their own destinies its incredible how much that adds to the film mad max fury road could easily have been a gorgeous but hollow spectacle reliant on its jawdropping practical effects and stunt work but not much else instead its a gorgeous fully realized spectacle with an unapologetic insistence on allowing women to form a part of its core narrativeand it will have hollywood rethinking its tired malecentric narrative

Jul 14 2016,positive, mad max fury road doesnt exactly feel like a narrative feature film there are no character arcs to speak of the plot is about as barebones as can be get from point a to point b and dont die dialogue is minimal motivations are obvious and unchanging and largely unexplored which isnt a problem given the productions interest in the basest of instinctsthe eternal social struggle between freedom and slavery rather mad max fury road feels like an extended special effects show a twohourlong sizzle reel designed to get you hyped for something bigger and more explosive though anything bigger and more explosive might have rather dire consequences for the planet action flicks dont get any bigger or more explosive than mad max fury road we open with the titular mad man played by tom hardy staring out over a ledge images of his dead family flash through his mind they have been reduced to ghosts haunting him for his failure to protect them after the world fell the planet has been rendered one huge desert an endless expanse of windblown sand swirling about the plains survival is the only thing that matters nowand surviving means staying on the move constantly running from scavengers and brigands captured after attempting to flee one such band of raiders max is taken to a citadel held by immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne and his sons war boys whose bodies are painted white and who live only to die for their father caged branded and tattooed with his blood type things are looking bad for max until joe realizes that imperator furiosa charlize theron has absconded with five of the beauties he keeps locked up for breeding in order to bring furiosa backno mean feat given that shes driving a war rig a sort of semi on steroids that is armed to the deathjoe sends his war boys after her one of the war boys nux is getting a blood transfusion from max but desperately wants to go on the raid so he chains his blood bag max to the front of the car and takes off after furiosa for a movie titled mad max it feels like max is barely in it oh hes in it hes in almost every scene but hes very frequently not doing a great deal for the first third or so of the flick hes wearing a mask and strapped to the front of a car and i would be surprised if the number of words he utters tops 300 granted mel gibsons max wasnt exactly loquacious but hardys is almost mute indeed it occasionally feels as though the movie should be titled imperator furiosa ft max rockatansky not that theres anything wrong with that therons a fantastic actress and does intense anger about as well as anyone working today but this movie is her story not maxs its about her quest to save five women from sex slavery and in the course of doing so rediscover the land from which she had been stolen almost 20 years before director george miller makes excellent use of nontraditional actors in fury road the five aforementioned beauties are played by a veritable rainbow of models the strawblonde rosie huntingtonwhiteley the whitehaired abbey lee the redheaded riley keough the brunette courtney eaton and the ravenhaired zoe kravitz kravitz and keough are the only members of the quintet with more than a handful of imdb credits on the male side of the ledger you have nathan jones an enormous australian strongman who suffered a spiral fracture whilst armwrestling the equally enormous magnus samuelsson miller employs these folks for a reason they look cool a coterie of leggy models wearing wispy fragments of clothing in the desert is a striking image just as theres something striking about a manmountain deltoids bulging hoisting the engine of a car above his head even as the vehicle is doing 80 miles per hour on the desert flats if youre into watching a bunch of things that look cool killing each other for two hours on the big screenand really who isnt into thatthen fury road will be to your liking and if youre not well theres always pitch perfect 2 one final note please dont see this picture in 3d the director himself prefers two dimensions if you pay extra money to see this movie in 3d you will not only deserve the eyeache that you get but youll also be rewarding an evil immoral corporation that is trying to separate you from your money by forcing you to watch something you dont want
Jun 14 2016,positive, if you want a vision of the future at least from george millers perspective picture a boot stamping on a human face for about two hours those in search of a bludgeoning good time will find it in his new scorchedearth action extravaganza mad max fury road  its hard to remember the last time a summer tentpole movie overdelivered in the ways this does in resurrecting the australian postapocalyptic roadmovie series that made his name  and launched mel gibsons career  over three decades ago miller has skipped the salad and gone straight for the steak never mind that his last liveaction feature was babe pig in the city in 1998 fury road is a masterclass in cinematic onslaught its as if the director had taken the climactic tankerchase sequence from mad max 2 and strung it out into an entire film its exhilarating but also exhausting working with cinematographer john seale and editor margaret sixel who is also millers wife the 70yearold director adopts an approach that could almost be called oldschool especially when compared to the weightless cgi that defines most bigbudget action flicks nowadays his set pieces  and this is a film that consists of little else  have a pleasing sense of gravity and physical heft to them the product of bravura stunt work judicious digital tweaking and lots of heavy metal colliding theres real coherence in the way theyre spliced together the shots all connect and only in the most frenzied moments does it become hard to parse whats going on in a time of both misinformation and too much information quality journalism is more crucial than everby subscribing you can help us get the story right
Jun 10 2016,positive, as the film begins max has been captured by the war boys a breed of ghostly white bald manchildrenscarred and stapled and riddled with bulbous tumorsbred to be immortan joes fighters max his face partly covered by a banestyle iron mask curious since hardy also played bane is to serve as a human blood supplier for the war boy nux nicholas hoult until he manages to escape when immortan joes army goes after a rogue commander named imperator furiosa charlize theron furiosa is certainly the films best creationa bald shewarrior with a metal arm a giant smokebelching war rig and a righteous cause shes trying to bring immortan joes five wives to the childhood home that she barely remembers a utopian land of female warriors 
May 28 2016,positive, the production company logos that open george millers mad max fury road are accompanied by the deep rumbling of a loudly revving engine  and good luck finding a more appropriate starter pistol for this movie which is like a machine that roars at full throttle for two solid hours millers last entry in the max franchise which has run the gamut from grubby lowbudget exploitation movie to pricey studio blockbuster was 1985s beyond thunderdome where in something of an artistic suicide he saved the series signature motif of trickedout postapocalyptic vehicles roaring across the desert plain for the final 20 minutes of the movie no such restraint is shown here fury road is for all intents and purposes a 120minute chase where the focal vehicle must keep moving and thus so must the movie but theres more happening here than empty spectacle which has drawn the ire of some of the internets more odious commentators later for them sociopolitical ramifications aside fury road is plain and simple a bracing sublime towering slab of cinema a rare thriller that actually yknow thrills fair warning it takes some time to get going as reintroductions and often muddy exposition are necessary tom hardy steps into mel gibsons iconic role of max rockatansky haunted by voices and nightmare visions captured and kidnapped into a terrifying dystopia ruled by the tyrannical immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne  yes the same hugh keaysbyrne who played the toecutter in the original film which is a lovely easter egg for longtime fans max is kept alive merely as a blood bag for nux an unrecognizable nicholas hoult one of the many bees of joes horror hive sent across the desert on a supply mission leading that charge is imperator furiosa a greasebrowed charlize theron who suddenly changes course and sets off the pursuit these opening scenes are the rockiest miller struggles a bit with his tone the storytelling is heavy on the gibberish and the first chase while technically dazzling isnt all that involving the general murkiness of the early scenes is done no favors by the inevitable darkening of 3d projection do yourself a favor and seek it out in 2d the filmmakers preference for this viewer the movie doesnt come alive until the action scene that follows a roughandtumble bit of handtohand combat between max nux furiousa and her precious cargo the five wives of big bad joe played by zoë kravitz rosie huntingtonwhiteley riley keough abbey lee and courtney eaton its a sequence of intense ingenuity and constantly shifting power dynamics and it brings the picture to life for one simple reason first we were just looking at machines but now were looking at people and understanding those people makes the subsequent scenes of their machines matter more yet thats not all that makes millers work as an action director so stunning and what separates him from the monotonous biggerlouderfaster likes of michael bay or the furious artiste of your choice its that he understands and employs in his set pieces such inchoate yet frequently absent principles as geography rhythm and tempo much has been made of the ferocity of the editing  2700 cuts per the filmmaker but it doesnt feel as choppy and discombobulated as say a transformers movie because those films seem cut to disorient while creating the impression of speed and excitement while miller and his editor and wife margaret sixel situate the viewer within the sequence to create actual speed and excitement and even more revolutionarily they vary that speed throughout the picture shifting gears like the drivers of those big rigs which goes a long way towards keeping viewers from feeling like theyve been bashed in the head with a fucking hammer for 120plus minutes it doesnt hurt that hes also more inclined towards practical effects than computergenerated ones which gives the action far more weight and heft than the collections of 1s and 0s that pass for stunts nowadays as fury road geared up for its magnificent climax i was reminded of a quentin tarantino interview where he recalls seeing john woos a better tomorrow ii for the first time with a friend who turned to him at about the same point and posited if they dont get naked and boogie at the end of this movie this has been for nothing have no fear  miller gets naked and boogies that final chase is quite simply one for the books a dazzling delirium of dust and fire and sheer kinetic force miller zips his camera pulls out his sound wails his punches and bangs and fuses his shots up against each other like a welder it is bonkers and it is brilliant and here we are nearly 700 words in and ive barely mentioned the people that populate this film  which says more about the elegance of the style than the purveyors of its substance hardy is unsurprisingly a perfect max easily sliding into the wandering gunslinger archetype lest we forget he was introduced in thunderdome as the man with no name his two or three moments of fleeting humor andor humanity shrewdly parsed out over the narrative he is as usual a man who does more than he says miller regards him in much the same manner theres a wonderful bit where he doesnt even bother to follow max away from the group on a solo sidebar  he merely regards his condition as he leaves and as he returns hes great and the titles the title but this is unquestionably therons movie she works with authority fights like a badass thinks on her feet and generally wrecks shop and if you can make it through the scene where she hoists a rifle onto maxs shoulder takes careful aim at an approaching vehicle and growls dont breathe and not burst into applause well youre made of stronger stuff than i but when she lets out her howl of rage and grief at what should be the culmination of a physical and emotional odyssey it becomes clear that shes the character at the pictures center shes the one who takes the risk and who takes the journey thats the way these movies work max took his the first time out and serves as an aide andor inspiration in subsequent installments much of the advance word on the movie even before its mens rights activist boycott held that her character and story gave the film a decidedly feminist bent but this isnt a case of halfhearted female stuff or the current vogue of but with ladies repurposing the eve ensler consulting hire actually makes sense in the context of the movie this is a story of survivors of sexual violence fighting back and reclaiming themselves that they are first revealed in a vaguely eroticized bit with a water hose is a clever baitandswitch on millers part and a sly acknowledgment of the way as writer matthew monagle notes exploitation filmmakers have from the corman era forward smuggled progressive messages into their genre sheeps clothing and to that specific point chargeleading mra garbage person aaron clarey is right when he accuses miller of using the max franchise and action cinema in general as a trojan horse for a feminist message though hes wrong about absolutely everything around that point his insistence that the australianmade max films are american culture and his declaration that nobody barks orders at mad max seem to imply that hes never actually seen a mad max film and his chicken littling about how feminism has infiltrated and coopted hollywood seems to imply that hes never actually seen a movie period make no mistake via this smashing thrilling crowdpleasing studio summer blockbuster a decidedly prowoman provictim proempowerment message will reach an audience that might notve gone looking for it and that friends is even more delightful than a movie that pisses off a bunch of knuckledragging retrograde retroactive mouthbreathing mras
Apr 27 2016,positive, yes fury road is of course yet another remake reboot or reimagining with veteran australian director george miller returning to the character which he first unleashed in his original gnarly 1979 bpicture a film which also made a star of a young mel gibson seventy yearold miller whose biggest other hits as a director have been the babe and happy feet movies might seem to have long moved on to gentler greener pastures but his fourth max is just as berserk as any of the others it seems miller has gone back to road warrior  the previous maddest of this maxes  for the brutal tone of this while cannibalizing bits of the earlier films and their mythology fury road stands apart from them too you dont need to have seen them to get a kick out of this but it will also reward your affection for the old movies too while the previous flicks had an identifiably australian setting  they came juiced by aussie petrolhead and bikie culture  this one shot mostly in the eyescorchingly epic deserts of namibia exists in a posteverything world of its own and despite tina turners thunderdome theme of old miller did need another hero hes effectively got two theres tom hardy as max a guy who is neither as pretty or as talkative as his predecessor but clearly more damaged she starts out as the amputee bionicarmed road warrior in the service of immortan joe the grotesque despot  though he does have tinas hair  who rules over the citadel a rock city towering above the desert played behind the oxygen mask by hugh keaysbyrne who was villain the toecutter in the first max joe is a tyrant with a hydrant rationing water to the dirtdwelling rabble below when max is taken prisoner in the citadel he ends up as a blood donor to ailing war boy nux nicholas hoult whose genes are suffering a radiation hangover from whatever turned to the old world to dust when furiosa decides one of her fuel delivery trips will be an escape for her and joes harem a muzzled max ends up as a hood ornament cum drip stand on the front of a nuxs pursuing car eventually max winds up still with enough plasma aboard furiosas heavilyarmed road train tanker carrying joes willowy young brides to their desert sunset fashion shoot  ah no some sort of sanctuary thats just one of half a dozen or more spectacular vehicular battles rendered often in long takes with little visible digital effects enhancement miller who also brings back some of the early films trademark overcranked speedzooms visually fury road is also a movie of stark beauty especially in the few minutes of its 120 on screen it decides to sit still and take in the scenery this is a car chase movie which brings its own band along one of the chase vehicles carries a flamethrowing metal guitarist backed by a tribal mass percussion section max himself sure isnt a lot of laughs hardy only has a few lines his back story filled in with nightmare flashbacks one looking like its lifted a frame of one of maxs former victims from the early films but hes a commanding presence no furiosa cant save those girls  ho ho  singlehanded but shes the human touch in this inhumane world and the madly beating heart of this technical wonder of a movie
Apr 15 2016,neutral,a wildly monotonous film that operates at one volume  fortissimo  bludgeoning us over the head into either submission or exhaustion
Mar 30 2016,positive,audiences will immediately recognize its undeniable prowess and actionclassic qualities that have been missing from the world of cinema for quite some time now
Mar 15 2016,positive, at the time of going to press some very curious and unprecedented chatter was doing the rounds online namely that mad max fury road could well be in line for oscar glory next year its not usually chatter afforded to walletbusting action wheezes but thanks to oscarwinning cinematographer john seale this film has the makings of a winner and the look of the craziest most delirious spectacle youre likely to lay eyes on this year as in sit too close and you might lose your nachos the fourth instalment of mad max is packed to the gills with big names but first a moment of reverence for the films director george miller as the man behind the original 1979 mad max blockbuster the australian directors career has taken him hither and thither in hollywood from babe pig in the city to happy feet long story short were in safe enough hands here behind the camera and its all needed to create the desperation of this arid postapocalyptic world calling the shots is immortal joe hugh keaysbyrne who controls the populations water supply and produces vast amounts of mothers milk from his own battery farm of imprisoned pregnant women she is heading back to the oasis that she was snatched from as a child trailing her are a raggle taggle of comely sirens beautiful breeders that warlord joe wants to have babies with out in front of the camera things are equally as promising as behind it tom hardy playing our hero max has emerged relatively unscathed from child 44 where he was caught rapid channelling the count from sesame street this time round hes playing a straightup hero no twist with the right amounts of humanity herculean strength and tenacity hes a compelling max if a man of few words and fewer emotions charlize theron meanwhile playing the haunted imperator furiosa is equally compelling rosie huntingtonwhiteley looks properly luscious in the role of splendid a doomed breeder props too go to nicholas hoult playing wildeyed foot soldier nux with vim ambition of scale does not automatically equate greatness remember waterworld but in this case the eyepopping extravagance is a real joy its loud and boisterous to a nervejangling point the action sequences which are hyperstylised unfold at velocities that will make your head spin every so often though the whole juggernaut runs off the reservation drunk on its own spectacle for reasons best known to the films creators the warlord is accompanied by his very own metal guitarist and drummers playing atop a truck techno it seems did not survive the apocalypse soz the pudding is officially overiced but a film that uses 3500 storyboards and 480 hours of raw footage wasnt really fated to be a cinematic turkey its not so much mad max as well maximum madness strap yourself in its a hell of a ride
Mar 15 2016,positive, your first thought watching clouds of sils maria is that you dont envy writerdirector olivier assayas having to manoeuvre juliette binoche and kristen stewart about a filmshoot in the alps to be fair theres a chemistry between the two famously mercurial leading ladies that makes perfect sense while also suggesting assayas may have something of a magic touch it is a dominant factor in why this elegant ponderous european film works on the levels that it does binoche is maria enders an ageing screen goddess travelling with her vaguely emo pa valentine stewart to accept an award on behalf of the aged playwright who gave her her first break he passes away en route they discover and soon afterwards an edgy young director asks her to appear in his new production of the same play  only this time as the tragic elder of the two central female protagonists maria and valentine decamp to the alpine home of the late writer to rehearse of course thats only part of what goes on theres lots of metadramatic undulations as maria faces usurpation by the bratty starlet set to play opposite her chloë grace moretz all the while smudges appear as maria and valentine collide at varying temperatures its chatty and meanders a bit but theres a hypnotic unfixed ambience to clouds of sils maria that is wholly compelling and more than likely intentional on assayas part full of wit wisdom and knowing glances it may be but its earthy and sensuous too a mature perceptive drama for grownups a new british royal has just landed in this world but dont expect princess charlotte to get a viewing of this problematic comedydrama about her greatgrandmother and greatgrandaunt itching for a night out on the tiles to celebrate ve day in 1945 playing elizabeth is david cronenberg favourite sarah gadon alongside bel powleys more unruly margaret they implore king george rupert everett and the queen emily watson to let them on the loose but quickly shake their military escort and are dazzled by the lairy hubbub soon liz is skipping through the braying streets of london in search of her sister who has run off with some pilot and is now in the back room of a brothel yes you read that correctly helping her negotiate such frightful things as buses and people is jack reynors robust squaddie helpfully called jack a royal night out fancies itself as some kind of richard curtis pastiche whereby the beautiful caged princess gets swept off her plummy vowels by jacks everyman who of course has no idea what or who she is the problem is that these are real people who are alive and well and sitting on thrones so its not really spoiling things to say that at the very logical moment when our two handsome young leads should lock lips in romance the camera has to swing away awkwardly so as not to get anyone into any trouble this gives the entire operation a hollow ultimately conflicted feeling it has its charms  a jazzage fizz powleys gooning a tasteful aesthetic  but it is too lightweight wicklowman reynor meanwhile struggles with the london accent its been three years since pitch perfect proved a surprise box office hit the story of the barden bellas the acappella girl group fighting the boys for competition supremacy surfed the glee wave by adding a bit of knowing humour and proving far less derivative than expected the sequel finds the young women nearing graduation and thinking somewhat vaguely of the future its a consideration made all the more important in the opening scenes when the bellas having reigned supreme for those three years face the ignominy of failing in front of president obama fat amy rebel wilson suffers a wardrobe malfunction during a wrecking ballstyle aerial number and the world gets a chance to see what type of waxing she

das sound machine perfect specimens of somewhat fetishistic acappella greatnesscue some arguments singoffs and lots of great singing beka anna kendrick is the only one seriously considering a future after college as she gets a secret internship in a recording studio theres also a new recruit emily hailee steinfeld who is keen to sing her own compositions and presumably take on the mantle when kendrick wilson et al graduate kay cannons script is sharp in some places like the digs at casual misogyny conservative americas assumption that a bit of female anatomy is the worst thing ever is a case in point and the thoughtless insults delivered by the commentators john john michael higgins and gail elizabeth banks are the most consistently funny parts of the film the other humour is a bit more hit and miss and rebel wilson starts to grate after a while overall the script does feel a bit formulaic and contrived in parts i especially didnt like the parts that were meant to be heartfelt but perhaps im just a heartless ould boot there are lots of cameos and a good few laughs and on the whole lots to enjoy for fans of glee style musicals and fans of the first film wont be disappointed it also happens to be elizabeth banks feature directorial debut and she does it well the gods may have chucked all kinds of obstacles  from unfavourable exchange rates to actual wars  in the way of this belated fourth instalment of george millers gasolinesoaked western but it has been worth the wait such a wobbly genesis combined with a monstrous budget 150m and comparable storyline could have seen mad max fury road go the way of waterworld shudder the key here is that miller himself is still at the helm and hes had a long time  30 years since tina turner cackled in beyond thunderdome  to think about just how he wants his legacy to remain intact controversial mainstay mel gibson is dropped from the role of the titular road warrior for tom hardy the dark knight rises inception mad tormented and murmuring sparsely in a lee marvin burr hardy does nicely as the brave loner reluctantly helping charlize therons traitor guide five young women across the scorched nothingness of postapocalyptic oz they are on the run from immortan joe hugh keysbyrne a monstrous dictator and his army of tooledup and revvedup war boys who rampage over the sands the word electrifying is flung about too lightly in describing action cinema but fury road is certifiable in this respect there is barely any letup over its two hours of grinding whiteknuckle gear changes crashes and explosions max and his charges are hunted from one knife edge to the next and talk is kept to a minimum it could be tedious if it wasnt so downright stylish and smart miller now ranks alongside gilliam lynch burton et al as one of cinemas more distinct visionaries thanks to this elseworld of warped hideous survivors and bizarre contraptions i confess that the prospect of two hours of a ukrainian film with no words just sign language and no subtitles did not fill me with great excitement yet myroslav slaboshpytskiys writingdirectorial debut is one of the most remarkable films of the year slaboshpyrskiy has said that his dream was to pay homage to the silent movie and in this he does it in an extraordinary way unlike other productions which feature deaf characters in a hearing world this is total immersion in a world where everyone is deaf sergey grigoriy fesenko arrives in a large institution for deaf teenagers and must negotiate his place in a wellestablished hierarchy there are rites of passage to accede to the most powerful levels of this hierarchy which is built largely on an after school hours schedule of crime and prostitution at night with the help of the woodwork teacher the young men go out to mug people and drink two of the young women anna yana novikova and another unnamed rosa babiy are transported to have unprotected sex with lorry drivers with the ultimate aim of getting them to work in italy when sergey falls in love with anna the rules are broken and the balance tipped there is a kind of lord of the flies vibe and much of it is graphic and unflinching for one protracted scene raw in terms of both visuals and emotion i simply had to look away a tough film but with many rewards
Mar 15 2016,positive, a sequel being released 30 years after its predecessor must be something of a record but in fairness to george miller hes been planning this film since 1988 in the original mad max a transgressively violent dystopian thriller miller and mel gibson had made their names telling the story of max rockatansky a motorcycle cop adrift in postapocalyptic australia released in 1980 the film was dismissed as tasteless schlock by critics but would soon become a cult classic and it spawned two sequels mad max 2 1981 and mad max beyond thunderdome 1985 by the time that last film came out critics such as roger ebert had begun to realise what miller was up to and that his films were full of style and ideas as well as gore the story for mad max fury road occurred to miller in 1988 and he conceived the film as a road movie in which max and his antagonists are fighting not over precious resources but enslaved people it took him more than a decade to find the time to make it and in 2001 was all set to begin shooting when 911 happened a 2003 attempt was shut down mainly because of the outbreak of the iraq war and after that mel gibson appears to have lost interest heath ledger was considered as his replacement but after his death when miller returned to the project in 2010 tom hardy was cast as max that sort of production history usually results in a stinker but mad max fury road is a wonderful exception to the rule because its a scintillating action picture breathlessly edited glorious to look at poor max is still wandering australias desert wastes in the aftermath of civilisations collapse when hes captured by feral soldiers and taken to a remote desert kingdom the wasteland is a kind of feudal fascist state ruled by a growling bellicose tyrant called king immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne who controls the water supply and ekes it out to a pathetically grateful horde of underlings bizarrely immortan joe farms hefty women for their milk which is considered a bit of a delicacy and also maintains a harem of girls intended to provide him with heirs other slaves max among them are used by the kings sickly warriors for transfusions of healthy blood but while hes being dragged on a convoy across the desert he manages to escape and when he stumbles on a group of young women whove sneaked out of wasteland he finds common cause with their tightlipped leader imperator furiosa charlize theron and they began a battle to escape to freedom together the plot of fury road is deliberately basic miller never makes the mistake of explaining too much about his apocalyptic world and little hints here and there invite you to fill in the gaps yourself instead he focuses entirely on the momentum of what after 20 minutes of scenesetting essentially becomes an extended chase movie for this is a nightmarish future in which all legal checks have been removed leaving the strong to prey on the weak with impunity bits and pieces of pop culture have survived in the bizarre pageantry of the kings retinue which includes massed kodo drummers and a manic electric guitarist suspended off the front of a moving truck onearmed and crewcut charlize theron is still the bestlooking person in the movie though rosie huntingtonwhiteley gives her a run for her money playing one of the kings heavily pregnant concubines perhaps its the writing or maybe tom hardys puzzling reluctance to seize the spotlight but this is ms therons picture and her intensity and tenaciousness steals every scene from hardys gloomy and curiously lifeless max

Feb 29 2016,positive, what a ride of a movie if you think the fast and the furious series is the ultimate rollercoaster thrill about what motor vehicles are capable of then you are dead wrong master director george miller the creator of the mad max series that began in 1979 proves once again that he is at the top of his game with mad max fury road which hits theaters on friday yes surely there must be some cgi but the kind of cgi in this movie is only supplementary to what the filmmakers have achieved on the set  this set being the deserts of namibia for those who are accustomed to the series this film will not disappoint with regard to its unique dystopian spirit and quality of craftsmanship for those who are newcomers it will bring on a whole new world of vigor and blow their minds i might sound like im exaggerating but fury roads 120 minutes of filmmaking is spotless and tight as a rope with no room for maudlin or cheesy valor the movie is set in the near future in an australia gone haywire where the remains of civilization have been devoured and overthrown by highway gangs and water and oil have become rare resources in this postapocalyptic world one such gang led by the evil dictator immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne has set up a neocapitalist community run on slavery and exploitation the canyon where immortan joe has set up his regime has water but he dispenses it to his people scarcely and rarely that is not the only problem though he owns thousands of men who call themselves war boys high on blood anarchy and violence and ready to kill rape and destroy at joes will max tom hardy taking over mel gibsons throne is a traumatized lone man caught by the gang as a blood bag his voiceover clearly states what he is and thinks of himself i am a man haunted by the dead and hunted by the living i have only one instinct left and that is survival the action begins immediately joes right hand imperator furiosa charlize theron showing once again what a talent she is is set to lead a convoy of vehicles into a city where there is gas to refill their petrol on a huge rig that looks not like a truck but like a war machine at this point its important to note that the vehicle modifications in the series are legendary for their strange industrial design and lethal potential driving the huge rig we notice her cool but worried expression there is something utterly wrong here soon enough it is clear that she is trying to save a handful of women used for breeding purposes from the clutches of joe and take them to her childhood home called the green place joe catches on to what shes doing and goes after her with his own army of war vehicles and the endless chase begins in the vast deserts of australia as we watch the two groups in constant motion in a cat and mouse game that is truly fit for a cruel and relentless world where the weak and dumb die immediately max accidentally ends up in furiosas crew and finds himself aiding their getaway with his own freedom also in mind epic music blasts away constantly as the endless mastershots and closeups of those involved in the chase are thrown before us for our pure primordial need for adrenaline and fear we are always on the edge of our seats with no chance to breathe as we helplessly remain awestruck in the visual kinetics and acoustic splendor of this film but its not just about the thrill and postpunk atmosphere millers cinematic language is not at all vapid on a philosophical level and he makes it his main aim to show us what a dreadful place the world can be if left to the clutches of human greed one might think there is no branch of hope to hold onto here but one would be very wrong for miller also puts forth a very feminist egalitarian and just point of view through the character of furiosa and her band of women who gradually transform into a beacon of freedom and solidarity they become the only hope humanity is left with mad max fury road captures the joy and style of what action cinema once was  a good story with convincing characters supported by the stunning choreography of cinematography editing and production design prime minister ahmet davutoğlu has gone to the silopi district of şırnak province where a curfew that had been in place for months ended in january
Feb 23 2016,positive,  george millers mad max fury road is the potent powerful tonic we never knew we needed the fourth installment in his mad max franchise is an overwhelming reminder of the unique places blockbuster filmmaking can go if we take off the shackles and let it run wild to places that can be magnificent even though they might also be rancid putrid and disgusting the films postapocalyptic wasteland is a marvel to behold and festers inside one of the best action films weve seen in decades miller not only creates one of cinemas alltime best chases but he goes a step further to transform the story into a celebration of feminism striking back against patriarchy it may be a patriarchy riddled with gout and wielding chainsaws but no blockbuster has delivered its message with such verve and bravado   max rockatansky tom hardy was a cop before the world fell apart from nuclear war and ripped asunder by the need for water and fuel trying to live alone in the wasteland max is captured by war boys a group of young pasty darkeyed men who blindly follow the tyrannical immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne who has power only because he controls water and food meanwhile joes lieutenant imperator furiosa charlize theron pretends like shes making a trip to gas town on behalf of the demented leader but instead had gone rogue to protect the wivesfive young women who are used by joe for the purposes of breeding when joe discovers furiosa has betrayed him he sends out his war boys which include nux nicholas hoult who drags max along because he needs the road warriors universal blood type eventually max and furiosas paths collide and they must drive to the safety of the green place   fury road never apologizes for being weird it never winks at the camera no one questions names like gas town the only way to live in the broken world presented by mad max is to never question it miller doesnt want to turn off our brains or shock us into submission he wants us to jump into a grimy filthy pit thats endlessly fascinating in the world of mad max everythingincluding and especially human beingsis a resource and while miller maintains the essence of his previous mad max films not an easy task considering their vast differences he paints his richest picture on the biggest canvas the films designs are consistently grotesque but also absolutely breathtaking the movie is beautiful in its ugliness miller fills his movie with freaks and rejects who now rule the world and shows that this is a setting that has truly gone mad   that insanity extends to the action the film is one long chase scene we get a brief appetizer as max tries to escape from prison on foot but the real pursuit begins with furiosa goes on the run from there the movie rarely takes a moment to breathe as max furiosa and their passengers try to fend off rampaging hoards of bandits   millers film is a standout in the genre not only because the set pieces are terrifically designed but also because they have weight cgi is a marvelous tool but its become the only tool current blockbusters employ to get thrills from the audience theres still some cgi in mad max but its used mainly to provide texture to the environment such as crowds and putting joes insignia on the side of a mountain when it comes to the action the movie is hardcore explosive gleeful destruction as a unique assortment of vehicles comes bearing down on furiosas war rig fury road demands to be seen on the biggest screen and with the loudest speakers   despite the assault of action mayhem the movie never becomes prideful and maintains an offbeat sense of humor that goes beyond cartoonish violence miller manages to wrap the films strangeness in its visuals for example the muzzle max is forced to wear also represents the guilt he feels over the people he couldnt save if max refuses to do anything other than survive he may as well be a desperate hood ornament on nuxs car its not until he chooses to live for others that he becomes more than a muzzled blood bank this thematic richness pushes mad max beyond a visual feast and into a film thats surprisingly thoughtful without being smug or condescending   its not millers fault that so many other action films have no desire to deliver more than a couple hours of loud noises and bright lights many people like blockbusters because theyre not challenging and if you dont want to engage mad maxs themes you can still enjoy the picture but those who embrace the films subtext will leave with a far more fulfilling experience   the filmmaker takes a brilliant approach to feminism by expanding it beyond tough chicks are cool too often a strong woman in movies and television is one solely defined by her ability to inflict violence mad max goes further in its depiction of women theron is terrific as furiosa not just because shes physically formidable and gives a commanding performance underneath her tough exterior theron conveys furiosas guilt without the need for exposition we know shes looking for redemption because shes done joes dirty work for far too long i dont want female characters who are just tough i want to see women on screen who are unafraid to be vulnerable and then strike back at their enemies i want character arcs not props   the disturbing truth lying beneath the movies gritty exterior is that were not so far away from millers outlandish world aside from the environmental concerns of draining our planets resources miller hits a huge blow with the position of women in our current society if i have one criticism of mad max its that the movie takes too long to get to one of its best aspects and so it feels slightly abrupt when it reaches that point i dont want to spoil how the movie comes together but when it does it provides enough character diversity set against an incredible set piece to deliver a powerhouse rampage against misogynistic forces   im in awe that this subtext is even present and so shrewdly included into such a gloriously bizarre and psychotic landscape mad max fury road is the action movie weve forgotten to demand or perhaps we never knew we could ask for millers picture bursts from the mold screaming and mesmerizing its a pulsepounding ride with tremendous performances an electrifying score unforgettable set design astounding cinematography and all in service of not only entertaining the audience but also shaking them from a stupor it may be odd to quote aristotle when referring to a movie where characters have names like rictus erectus and toast the knowing but the quote is well earned no great genius has ever existed without some touch of madness  matt goldberg has been an editor with collider since 2007 as the sites chief film critic he has authored hundreds of reviews and covered major film festivals including the toronto international film festival and the sundance film festival he resides in atlanta with his wife and their dog jack
Feb 22 2016,positive, its not often delays financial dissolutions and waning interest make a film better but i dont want to know what mad max fury road might have been without them in its current form the film embodies a logical escalation of what director george miller began over three decades ago by embracing the insanity eating away at his titular road warriors resolve survival becomes a collective pursuit whether in the wastelands left behind after wars ravaged the earth of gasoline water humanity and life itself or a heaven won through sacrifice at the feet of megalomaniacs stealing themselves a throne status is measured by ones ability to reproduce repopulate and retain that iron fist on those only able to follow and while max would rather fade into the dust he never could let the oppressed languish in chains this fourth installment of millers postapocalyptic adventure series began as an idea in 1998 set itself up to shoot twice before 911 and the iraq war shook resolves financially and politically and even found a short spurt of lifespan retooled as an animated feature the director never stopped hoping or fighting to get the script cowritten by himself the original mad maxs grease rat nick lathouris and cult comic artist brendan mccarthy ready i have to imagine he realized how offtrack beyond thunderdome went because fury road is all about the highoctane action of warring factions inhabiting a lawless desert expansenot the inyourface potential for salvation or green notion of environmental decay that stuff remains but its relegated to a few lines of dialogue and character motivation what rises above is a destructionladen chase for freedom miller seeks redemption alongside max tom hardy in the role originated by mel gibson and imperator furiosa charlize theron he looks to bring back muscle and grit while they strive to erase memories of loved ones they couldnt save while the latter two are as close to saints wrapped in antihero bodies willing to do whatever it takes that this world can offer they can singlehandedly rescue a continent and still find no peace redemptions a concept that pushes them forward with purpose as waking nightmares of the dead refuse to let go this fact alone gives miller a successful rebirth because it shows how brutally honest he is with his creations the wastelands eat them alive spitting them out broken and screaming the briefest respite of sanity within it proves more painful than any physical duress endured the conceit is simple immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne returning to the franchise as a villain so farremoved from his toecutter that the confusion miller bred by utilizing bruce spence backtoback in identical roles is kept at bay rules a kingdom built on the fresh water he wields as a weapon to keep his citizens thirsty and loyal like he has done countless times before joe enlists furiosa to drive a war rig to gastown for a restock of fuel on this day however she goes rogue by hiding the warlords concubines rosie huntingtonwhiteley riley keough zoë kravitz abbey lee and courtney eatons five wives and detouring east towards the green place its not long before joes men discover the ruse and he alongside a militia of war boys take to the road to recapture his property max comes along for the ride accidentally after being captured an unknown period of time previously and transformed into a blood bag for war boy nux nicholas hoult almost at the end of his lifespan before meeting god in valhalla most definitely drawn in joes immortal image he uses maxs blood to stay strong enough to die in battle its the chance our iconic figure needsa free trip to the outside to bide his time until an escape opportunity arises like before however max cannot leave defenseless innocents to die so what begins as furiosa and max individually fighting against joe gastown and another city coming from all directions soon condenses to two lost souls against the world the war that commences explodes into a fiery spectacle unlike anything weve seen cinematically in decades that argument about how cgi has ruined the popcorn blockbuster is met with maniacal laughter on behalf of miller and his audacity to stay true to his roots if you didnt believe before that our collective disinterest in hollywood tentpole features stems from their disingenuous origins of pretending digitized pixels can replace reality you will after witnessing fury roads chaotic dance of vehicular and human choreography im talking cirque du soleil acrobats jumping from one moving automotive frankenstein to another revolving on sticks to swoop in with bombs and bullets as bodies fall under behemoth tires or fling into the atmosphere from the force of a cataclysmic crash theres even a truck carrying six giant timpani drums and an electric guitarist attached to bungee cords laying down riffs like 2060s version of a medieval trumpeter were allowed four breathes during the carnage one after an opening depicting maxs incarceration and three more separating the prolonged chase scenes shot in sumptuous color and pieced together by frenetic cuts theres a huge body count and a legitimate sense of dread throughout thanks to not being sure who might get ripped apart next the use of practical effects is key to this because we feel as though were watching a stunt that could very well end in death whether its someone crawling under a speeding tanker launching himself from the back of one car to the hood of another or running from a hail of gunfire everyone is holding onto a real piece of scenery that means they could easily lose their grip pull themselves up or get lost underneath the weight of shrapnel cinematographer john seale shoots so much coverage that i felt i was soaring in and out of the action despite edits instantaneously teleporting me from one place to another i know there were an intense amount of cuts and yet my memory conjures each sequence as a continuous take that is how invested i was in the action and the sorrow etched on the face of every actor we feel the reluctancy of hardys heroics the desire for hope underneath therons hardened glare and the wives fear of the unknown falling way short of what a homecoming with joe will bring for his part keaysbyrne is menacing even with his mouth covered for the duration hes the manifestation of millers new
