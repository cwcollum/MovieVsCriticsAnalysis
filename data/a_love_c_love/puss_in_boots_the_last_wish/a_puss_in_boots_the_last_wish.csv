Apr 11 2024,positive,absolutely phenomenal could not give a higher recommendation to a modern animated film
Apr 11 2024,positive,a mastery of pacing and animation movie tuckles havy themes like batteling over ones mortality looking for happiness and forming meaningfull relationships big jack horner felt a bit over the top and not really necessery but this movie is forever great to rewatch too bad its the only really good movie dream works made in reacent days and it might just be only good sequeal they made i mean theres shrek but i didnt really enjoy it and havent watched it since so
Apr 10 2024,positive,this movie was entertaining for the kids and the adults alike the characters were interesting and the animation was beautiful
Apr 6 2024,positive,puss in boots the last wish is the decadelater sequel to a spinoff franchise and yet it is the best movie in the shrek franchise thats no small feat when it has to match up against shrek 2 everything about this movie pushes the boundaries on how we view animated family movies from a message about coming to terms with our own mortality to humor that doesnt talk down to its viewers with 3 different kinds of antagonists the movie is able to make sure none are too hot or too cold striking that balance of just right across the board even a character like perro who you would expect to be the annoying comedic relief is a fun side character who contributes to the themes and flow of the story this movie was an incredible surprise that ensures that puss will always be our favorite fearless hero
Apr 6 2024,positive,a very fun sequel that delivers unlike megamind 2 a fun colorful great story family film for all to enjoy
Apr 5 2024,positive,given the movies that directly followed this im convinced that dreamworks didnt make this
Apr 5 2024,positive,nooo way this movie sooo amazing
Apr 3 2024,positive,every time jack was on screen it bored me unfortunately the hype didnt go as what i thought this movie would of been the wolf character bc of puss in boots last life i really like but he is barley in this movie unfortunately this movie is disappointing but i enjoyed it when it came to the very beginning and the 3rd act but the second act is boring bc jack wants a wish just for him to be so powerful bad motivation 82
Apr 1 2024,positive,beauty of a movie with amazing character growth and the designs are so gorgerous i love the backgrouns and every little frame the frame drops in fights are so so so good we need more movies like this
Mar 31 2024,positive,honestly peak dream works that took a smaller character and made an absolutely amazing story line the characters were all enjoyable and the comedic relief wasnt an annoying side character who serves no purpose to the story he actually had a character and felt like an important part of the team
Mar 30 2024,positive,this was an amazing movie 100 better than the 1st one
Mar 30 2024,positive,a sequel to puss in boots being considered a cinematic masterpiece is a shocker and i absolutely agree everything from the incredible animation to the compelling story  and the amazing performance from the voice actors its a non stop ride of action emotion comedy and i cant stress enough how amazing this film is chefs kiss and i hope this is the direction dreamworks goes for shrek 5
Mar 29 2024,positive,this film is fantastic in every way the animation is beautiful the comedy is spectacular and the movie is scary funny sad and exciting at the same time    all the characters are so fun and unique everyone is giving it their all and it is incredible    there are a lot of cameos from other character out of the shrek franchise that are very fun to see on the big screen again    there are great surprises sprinkled throughout that will excite and entertain you    last but not least this film has a surprising amount of dark moments and a wolf character that will maybe scare you    overall the movie is awesome     if you want a movie for the whole family to watch and enjoy in the theater then this one is perfect
Mar 28 2024,positive,puss in boots returns for a sequel with the hugest bang possible with a whole new animation design that resembles closely to spiderverse  tmnt the last wish made every fan rejoiced with its sense of humour and amazing choreography matching to none the film succeeded in doing something what dreamworks is known for targeting at mature audiences with topics as death depression etc it really is a dreamworks writing through and through the films major bonus point is the addition of most beloved fairy tale characters and showing their darker and gritty sides which really puts a new perspective in the minds of people who have grown up watching such titles the story explores the last life of puss which really puts a spin on what it means to live a life knowing there is no coming back   all in all  a great film that made me love dreamworks even more  hopeful in the future installments    pros  amazing cinematography and animation  great villain and characters arc  a complete and unique story  cons  some story points that feels to repetitive of the first movie but still blends in really well
Mar 28 2024,positive,lets go with the minuses  i was surprised by the level of violence portrayed in the movie at times its also quite loomingly scary with the characters of wolf played by wagner moura and big jack horner john mulaney being very violent wolf also occupies a very weird place in the film  i remained unclear if he was supposed to be a representation of death or death itself the new animation style was interesting but didnt really seem to serve a real purpose except for it being there    however these are quite minor and the movie itself is quite well put together with logical reasons for each of the characters to look for the wish maybe except kitty but its a small thing in the grand scheme of things perrito voiced by harvey guillen and goldilocks played by sheseverywhere florence pugh are interesting additions to the storyline the humour is also quite well done though again might fly over the kids heads and it was an enjoyable movie     overall a good movie though keep it for the older kids
Mar 28 2024,positive,great movie just everything the voice actors the animation highly recommend
Mar 27 2024,positive,epic animation epic music epic story and epic comedy if you havent seen the movie yet then what are you waiting for go see it now
Mar 27 2024,positive,a hero fallen from grace going through a midlife crisis as he realizes hes aging and death the wolf is getting closer and closer the shrek fairy tail universe is expanded upon introducing a whole plethora of new fun characters subplots to keep you invested and excellent animation and voice acting
Mar 26 2024,positive,this movie is definitely one of the best dreamworks films the cinematography animation voice acting and humour was just all fantastic this might be the next best film from dreamworks since how to train your dragon
Mar 26 2024,positive,fun movie whole family loved it little taco dog was funny and cute
Mar 25 2024,positive,show this to adults and kids animation is a medium so is this movie something for everyone to enjoy here
Mar 23 2024,positive,this movie is multidimensional and goes beyond what the trailer shows an exceeding of expectation no doubt and definitely not just for kids
Mar 23 2024,positive,perfect movie a complete animated movie in animation plot characters and humor
Mar 21 2024,positive,its long time ago that ive seen such a great movie the animation looks amazing and clearly took some inspiration from into the spider verse i can listen hours to the beautiful music the voice cast is great and i better characters are almost not possible the storyline is amazing and is focusing on really dark subjects you usually dont see in animated movies but it still has laughs and cute moments so this is still one of the best movies ive ever seen
Mar 21 2024,positive,this movie is a chad  dreamworks disney
Mar 21 2024,positive,its rare to see a sequel outshine everything else thats in theaters  the concept that puss was on his last life and tried to give up his adventures only to be brought back by friends for one last adventure was incredibly well done  the new characters were well written thought out and voiced over  although puss is brought somewhat low by his predicament hes never made to look weak and his many strengths still shine throughout the film  the new villains added an amazing contrast to the entire movie again written in a compelling way with really well done voice actors  the movie occasionally switches to a different type of painted animation for story telling  this was well executed and not overdone  all around this was well worth the theater tickets
Mar 20 2024,positive,all right nah amazing
Mar 19 2024,positive,what an amazing peace of art 
Mar 17 2024,positive,really good i love the story and the animation
Mar 17 2024,positive,one of my absolute favorites
Mar 16 2024,positive,explores quite an unsaturated area in movie design and makes the idea of mortality extremely approachable to the younger audience through many funny scenes which further dramatize the climax of the movie a huge visual overhaul compared to the movies predecessor
Mar 16 2024,positive,amazing movie like a breath of fresh air
Mar 14 2024,positive,this movie is amasing to whatch as a family on a friday and its a masterpiece and this movie is good and all
Mar 13 2024,positive,great movie 10 times better than the first movie this movie is about puss trying to find a star that will let him wish for all of his 9 lives back near the end of the movie puss starts to value the last life he has left the villains of the movie are amazing   1010
Mar 12 2024,positive,suprisingly the great sequel great plot and the one of the best villain
Mar 11 2024,positive,its pretty good and i would recommend it but its really annoying that hollywood consistently use the old cliché of cockney aka british working class accent for crude antagonists too much class snobbery which is not healthy for a young audience
Mar 9 2024,positive,best dreamworks movie i have ever seen both in terms of story and animation

Mar 2 2024,positive,puss in boots the last wish is a great and enjoyable movie the story was great the villains were good its a great movie for the shrek franchise and good to see that shrek was in the movie its a great sequel and one of my favorites i cant wait for shrek 5
Mar 2 2024,positive,puss in boots is amazing i watched this movie with my kids in january 2023 and oh boy was this a complete banger the movie is really intresting about how puss is on his last life and needs to go to the wishing star and make his wish to get back his nine lifes back since hes only on one more life left and lets not forget about the best dreamworks villlain of all time death death is the best dreamworks villain its literally no competition but jokes aside all the characters are really fun to watch not like the last puss in boots movie and the animation is splendid aswell its just really good but yeah this is a really attractive movie and i know i was really late on reviewing it i just needed more time to think about whats good
Feb 26 2024,positive,this movie is great for everyone even grandma even tho she is dead this movie is high quality animations and real models the voice actors are better and the story is amazing and reason why i wouldnt give a 5 star because not all movies are perfect
Feb 23 2024,positive,my favorite dreamworks moviesequel and my 2nd favorite movie ever
Feb 22 2024,positive,god i have no words for this masterpiece
Feb 22 2024,positive,one of the best animated movies in recent memory it harkens back to pixars golden days absolutely recommend for any and all ages with its slick animation for kids and story tackling mature themes for adults
Feb 19 2024,positive,rarity these days to see movie that kids and adults can both enjoy this shrek spinoff should be the blueprint for other studios for how to make smart animated movies
Feb 18 2024,positive,i really enjoyed the movie and watching this made me even more excited for whats to come from dream works its entertaining and a fun watch
Feb 13 2024,positive,a masterpiece i dont need to say any more
Feb 10 2024,positive,i think it couldve easily been a 45 or a 5 if it didnt spoonfeed a lot of the morals at the end like the message was very clear but they chose to make the characters spoonfeed you the moral making it less impactful amazing movie regardless the humor and the story was nice i think my favorite part are the scenes where puss is afraid of death these moments truly made the movie special
Feb 9 2024,positive,the writing in this movie is outstanding the cinematographic techniques they used was so involving and well done that i felt impressed the characters all of them with a great story and reasoning behind their actions marvelous the best animation movie ive seen this past years
Feb 8 2024,positive,this movie is absolutely spectacular  the storytelling the voices the incredible little bits of detail we see as we watch it beyond our first time its all just spectacular  and jack horner was a huge breath of fresh air for just being a purely evil villain with no sympathetic backstory or anything  but i think perrito has to be my favorite character  hes absentminded but not dumb  talkative but not annoying  and hes the sweetest soul you could ever come across  i can not praise this movie enough for any category
Feb 4 2024,positive,really good best movie dreamworks ever made watch it
Feb 4 2024,positive,this movie is awesome fresh animation good jokes loveable characters and menacing villains
Feb 4 2024,positive,masterpiece one of the best movies ive ever watched the plot the animation the characters the jokes everything is perfect the story has such great characters and i love how not all of them are redeemable it has a variety of villains each with their own personality some pure villains and some not the plot is amazing and the character development is perfect watch this movie
Feb 3 2024,positive,animation that in its narrative we have nothing new but it is so well done that laughing crying getting excited moved afraid reflecting and vibrating are natural reactions when watching it and if it is simplistic in its story the photography is spectacular being a real eye candy a sequel to the 2011 film that surpasses it and is worthy of an oscar a feat that only puss in boots can achieve your last wish could be fulfilled miauuu

Dec 17 2023,positive,death is terrifying tbh
Dec 17 2023,positive,this movie is probably one of the best dreamworks production movies to come to light and possibly the best of them all the animation is cartoonishly amazing with inspiration from the spiderverse series the humor is amazing like one of the subversion roots of shrek one of the things the shrek franchise will do right overall a 9710 action scenes characters humor folktale elements and the villains  were absolutely enjoyable and i dont have that much complaints about this movie and even then the flaws are snuffed out with more enjoyable scenes
Dec 17 2023,positive,this movie is awesome it has great sword fights great characters a great story but most of all a great villain its debatable on whether the villain is goldilox for lying big  jack horner for selfishness or death for scaring puss to death literally but the only one to get punished was big jack so a lot of people think its him but i disagree i think death is the villain because he is awesome just like the movie there are some corny bits which is why im giving it only four stars some senes i didnt approve of like the posey scene or the river scene i really dont think its romantic to give someone a haircut i mean seriously couldnt dreamworks come up with something a bit more romantic but other than those two scenes the movie is pretty good so if you havent watched it than you should
Dec 16 2023,positive,loved it tied with sherk part 1 in the sherk universe awesome animation and surprisingly great storyline loooooved it

Dec 6 2023,positive,great villians great character development and loved the growth you get see in the protagonist  who better to describe this movie than puss himself he was known across the land by many names the stabby tabby el macho gato the leche whisperer to some an outlaw to more a hero to all a legend i was right words were not enough    the three bears made me laugh and brought back that feeling i had back in the original shrek and shrek 2  playing on words and their whole story
Dec 6 2023,positive,i watch the first one and was disappointed with it so much that i delay watching this sequel well to my delight this is what i expected the first one to be like it has great plot characters and modern animations i hope that the next installment of this franchise whether from the main or side one such as this continues on this formula as its great
Dec 5 2023,positive,i dont understand why wasnt this nominated for best picture it is an excellent movie not only being serious but also fun and full of suspense
Dec 2 2023,positive,puss in boots the last wish is awesome the style gives you a sort of spiderman into the spiderverse vibe with a comic book sort of mix of 2d and 3d and pretty colors and scenery it was really funny detailed and at some parts a little scary and better than the first one this movie goes hard and you should watch it now
Nov 30 2023,positive,yes animation is amazing story is brilliant best dreamworks film to be released in ages
Nov 26 2023,positive,the overall plot is not something to be dazzled by its the characters that make it extraordinary once again cutting down on the whole parody aspect but scaling up on maliciousness and a much darker tone
Nov 26 2023,negative,tbh i liked the first one way more ofc was it important for dreamworks to make the movie friendly for kids but it was too childish for the movie the first one was also rlly cool for adults as well also the animations are rlly weird compared to the first movie
Nov 25 2023,positive,honest shocked at how good it was after shrek 4 i wasnt really expecting much  i was blown away at the quality of the animation the story and the character development    ive rewatched it several times just brilliant
Nov 25 2023,positive,this movie is so good i dont even know what to sayoh yeah death was the most epic character in the entire movie despite his super low screen time
Nov 24 2023,positive,a fun family movie the animation is very good it is not only for kids adults can also watch this movie go and watch the movie
Nov 23 2023,positive,amazing story i must see for every age
Nov 22 2023,positive,clever well thought out characters and compelling story
Nov 19 2023,positive,i could go on for hours about this film the soundtrack the fresh writing the boundaries broken the stylistic choices the tasteful handling of anxietythis movie is perhaps the best animated film ive ever seen just watch it
Nov 19 2023,positive,i think the plot has served its purpose while the animation itself is great its handling of the topic of death may not be appropriate for many audiences
Nov 19 2023,positive,this movie was actually pretty good i wasnt really too sure of what it was when i went to see it with my little brother but it was solid it has some awesome animation and action and the villain is cool
Nov 18 2023,positive,such an unexpected surprise i didnt mean to see this but i am so glad i did amazing characters deep meaningful themes and some of the best villains i have seen in years all of this combined with fun animation to produce one of my favorite animated movies of all time
Nov 18 2023,positive,outstanding the story visuals and meaning of the story is awesome
Nov 18 2023,positive,an amazing kids action packed movie a must watch could watch for hours the movie starts with an amazing introduction and an energetic start to finish this movie does not have any boring parts just turley amazing
Nov 17 2023,positive,it is pretty much a perfect movie that can be enjoyed by kids and adults there is a wolf character who is actually really dark and badass but the main villan big jack horner really holds the movie back from 5 stars
Nov 16 2023,positive,incredible animation actually good animation and they have legit villians
Nov 15 2023,positive,this has been one of my favorite movies for a year now since it came out  it has animation and visuals that are very pleasing to the eye and an excellent story im not up to date on pussboot lore and the past movies so im not sure if its accurate to the story or not but i think its really good
Nov 13 2023,positive,screw it this is a great masterpiecec and i really like this movie    this isnt my favorite dreamworks movie but its a masterpiece and i care for it more
Nov 12 2023,positive,meh i mean its alright but i loved jack horner
Nov 11 2023,positive,it was  perfect    so refreshing      its hard to write about this movie without spoils but really everything is perfect the voices the animations and the script    for kids its more than perfect and for the grown kids its even better haha   bravio 
Nov 10 2023,positive,this movie is just perfect in every possible way the music the art style the characters the plot the animation whenever the frame rate drops you literally see the best parts of the movie also can we just talk about the villain death the wolf is literally the best dreamworks villain of all time and its literally no contest before watching this movie i didnt pay to much attention but now having seen it this is the greatest movie in history if you have never watched this movie you need to watch this movie right now
Nov 10 2023,positive,this movie is glorious     the characters and their arcs are amazing enjoyable and likeable the animation is god tier like spider verse  the fight scenes are great and the music is great and the lessons about appreciating the life you have instead of using it and throwing your past behind you is amazing    its my favorite animated movie of all time
Nov 9 2023,positive,i personally believe this movie is great i love all of the different styles of animation its similar to spider verse and mutant mayhem i love the villians and there separate personalities i think goldilocks and the bears had a great ark and were very thought out characters jack horner had me dying while watching this movie he was so funny always talking about ruling the planet and last but not least death was one of the best villians in any movie i have ever watched even with deaths small aperance in the movie he built fear the movie can portray this in the beginning when puss defeats a giant it shows how strong he is but as soon as he meets death and death makes a threat it makes the audience think puss will win when puss ends out not winning and even getting scraped it puts a sense of fear into the audience and puss it in general makes deaths presence so unsettling from his non blinking eyes to him being everywhere at once death is a great villian puss is puss and kitty is kitty i forgot the dogs name but he was great and was hilarious
Nov 9 2023,positive,if youre a fan of adventure humor and daring heroes then puss in boots the last wish is the movie for you this film takes everything we love about the swashbuckling feline and adds a new layer of depth and emotion to his story    the animation is absolutely stunning with vibrant colors and beautifully rendered landscapes that transport you right into the world of puss in boots the voice acting is superb with antonio banderas once again bringing his signature charm and wit to the character of puss and the supporting cast including the sly and cunning big bad wolf are all perfectly cast and bring their own unique flair to the story    but what really sets puss in boots the last wish apart is the emotional journey that our hero goes on we see him struggle with the consequences of his adventurous lifestyle and confront his own mortality in a way that is both heartwarming and thoughtprovoking and yet even in the face of his own mortality puss never loses his sense of humor or his indomitable spirit    puss in boots the last wish is a fivestar adventure that will leave you on the edge of your seat in tears but with a smile on your face whether youre a longtime fan of the series or just looking for a fun and exciting family movie this one is not to be missed
Nov 8 2023,positive,by far the best family movie i watched in years my family and i enjoyed every minute and in the end felt a full sensation of goodness and satisfaction i couldnt recommend it more
Nov 7 2023,positive,i cant complain this is a masterpiece i am blown away 10 outta 10 movie
Nov 6 2023,positive,this film is an exciting thrill ride of a film that your whole family will enjoy this film is a fun adventure across the shrek universe that has lots of references to the original shrek films the story is action packed and fast paced with lots of fun and interesting references to old fairy tales like pinocchio little jack horner and goldilocks and the three bears this will make teenagers reflect on their childhoods and feel nostalgic also the adventure that our main characters take it will keep you on the edge of your seat as they go on a long journey to get to the dark forest and then traverse that forest which is a new and colourful location this movie has some outstanding characters such puss in boots he is a fun funny and a complex character who at first doesnt take care of his lives until he learns at the end of the film why you should spend your life in the best way you can alongside puss we have kitty soft paws who wants the wish to find someone who she can trust perito is a fun sidekick that helps kitty and puss get their wishes without magic goldilocks learns an important lesson about family she tells her bear family that she wants a real family instead of living in a family of bears but she learns that she should love the family she has with the art style in this film are taking a lot of inspiration from one of my favourite movies of all time called spiderman into the spidey verse this film has an art style similar to comic book and the main character of the film miles loves comics so it also kind of fits with the movie back to puss in boots the visual look is done with a paint brush which makes this movie look aesthetically pleasing to its audience now on to the music every single song fits the theme of the scene that you are watching it goes from the banger opening with the song fearless hero to the wolfs whistling theme which is ominous and adds a level of fear to this mysterious wolf this is why the art and music of this film makes it stand out significantly to the over films dreamworks has released over the years overall this film is worth a watch 910
Nov 5 2023,positive,the movie was very nice and quality and had a smooth and cartoony animation style the villains were good and a nice refresher from the new rule that villans have to have a sad back story and a possibly redeeming factor about them had a nice story and a very cool ending
Nov 3 2023,positive,puss in boots the last wish is far better than it had the right to be this is the sixth movie in the shrek franchise its a sequel to a spinoff and yet i found myself laughing more than i have since shrek 2 the animation is vibrant  colorful and the action sequences are highly energetic its obvious that the animators took good notes while watching spiderman into the spiderverse antonio banderas and salma hayek pinault do a good job as per usual but newcomers harvey guillén florence pugh and john mulaney gave memorable performances as well it seems that puss really is a legend
Oct 31 2023,positive,hilarious movie with a few fun twists and turns    watched it 3 times so far
Oct 30 2023,positive,christ this movie slaps how is this a movie sequel to a movie 1000x worse than this if i had to sum this movie up in one word it would be beautiful in this movie puss is on his last life caz cats have 9 lives so he goes to a wishing star to wish for 9 more lives but on the way he encounters 8 people kitty soft paws returning from the original perito goldilocks and the 3 bears crime family jack hornerpure evil and the one and only death yes you heard me the embodiment of death he is so cool his spine chilling whistle scares puss making his runaway scenes so spine chilling but i think he was just trying to tell puss that respect his life because it wont last forever also jack horner is just to evil he deserved is defeat 2nd best movie of 2022

Oct 28 2023,positive,pib 2 puss in boots 2 aka puss in boots the last wish is an absolute mustsee from the opening song describing our fearless hero all the way to the end of the film at the site of the wishing star pib 2 left me laughing and crying and feeling everything in between this sequel to a spinoff of a sequel to the original shrek movie had me laughing and crying how did this happen the characters were extremely memorable for one big jack horner was a great intentionally onedimensional villain and the character of death was truly terrifying the comic relief perrito a small abandoned puppy stole the show this movie would have been pretty good with out perrito but with perrito it was great one of the best scenes in the movie had to have been when puss is having a incredibly realistic panic attack and perrito is able to do what hes always wanted to do be a therapy dog for his friend this substance in storytelling wasnt the only thing that made this movie great its style was also phenomenal based on the style of spiderman into the spiderverse this film dazzles with its color palette direction and dropped frame rate during key moments of intensity but by far the great element of this movie was just how funny and entertaining it was pib 2 is a mustsee if you havent already seen it
Oct 27 2023,positive,great story  great characters and great animation puss in boots the last wish delivers on all fronts puss is amazing the character ark he goes on is great but the thing the movie does best is the villains one of the villains might just be one of if not the best villain in an animated movie and the film also some how balances all villains perfectly this is one of dreamworks best

Oct 15 2023,positive,art cannot be rushed or it wont be as perfect as it should be comparing puss in boots return to the first time he spun off from the shrek films shows how much the focus been improved to greater results certainly inspired animation being freshly stylized with increased attentive coordination while the performances vocally attributes to the thematic heft with trulyembraced passion particularly banderas who personally emphasizes with his characters mortality an exceptional homecoming to the surrounding statuses in promising thoughtprovoking forms as the film amazes over its talented displays that nicely switches between humorous fun and realistic subtextual poignancy through a conscientious story that doesnt ridicule a

Sep 17 2023,negative,puss in boots did not live up to the hype it was pretty standard animated movie and not that special the best part is the character design of the wolf i also really didnt like how it randomly switched to a stop motion style animation whenever there was action they were trying to copy spiderverse and failed it just make it hard to follow and annoying to watch its not terrible but the internet made it sound amazing and it was not that good definitely does not deserve to be rated at high as it is
Sep 17 2023,positive,this film and writing is incredible its funny although it should be a 13plus with the villain of death
Sep 17 2023,positive,a great animated film with fantastic animation great characters and great action

Sep 12 2023,negative,after the excellent first puss in boots big hype to see his sequel but what a fraud a disaster on all points at the complete opposite of the first movie atmosphere dialogues humorjokes animation graphic details11 years after all is bad in this second movie for us its an unsolvable riddle an enigma if it was only me i would live with it like ok its just me and the time but kids said it before i said it  its not funny and whats wrong with their fur  we had the same feeling than when we saw angry birds 2 the first angry birds is a masterpiece the second is a mercantile joke with a very cheap humor but animation was good for angry birds 2 not for puss in boots 2 very bad movie and more compared to the first puss in boots so 2 stars for us
Sep 11 2023,positive,an endearing feline protagonist accompanied by a great soundtrack and a heartwarming tearjerker that reminds us to cherish those who choose to be in our lives

Sep 7 2023,positive,this is an unexpected gem of a movie the art the several villansantagonists and the main characters all look so amazing and are so lovable this movies art style is phenomenal an amazing leap forward from the last puss in boots movies and other shrek universe films the main villain throughout the entirety of the film is so awesome he is a perfectly executed character that makes me love watching the movie even the parts where it puts puss in danger
Sep 7 2023,positive,ive heard a lot of good stuff about this movie by my friends at college and now ive seen it and its perfect love how sometimes mostly during fight scenes the animation transitions between lower and higher frames kinda like spiderverse and i love it and the ending got me thrilled to wait what is next for the crew and perhaps their old friends

Sep 3 2023,positive,its an awesome movie to watch with the family
Sep 1 2023,positive,finally watched the next instalment in the shrek universe puss in boots the last wish this film is one of my favorite animated films of all time now    to be completely honest i watched this film only for the antagonist but i was pleasantly surprised by all the supporting characters yes all the characters it is a rarity to find great supporting characters in animated films unfortunately but this film breaks that stereotype all of them have something to offer to the story and the themes my favorites were perrito goldi and of course death    the conflict  the resolution and the ending in my opinion are just perfection because i cannot think of anything better than what i actually saw moving to the technical aspects the animation was spectacular the best in the universe i couldnt take my eyes off of the screen and the design of death was the besti watched a video about his design which made me appreciate the character even more the music was pretty cool too especially deaths whistle which was creepy as hell and i assure you that it will haunt you forever    coming to the negatives i kind of found it difficult to get immersed into the world during the initial 20 minutes but when i understood the theme of the film i got right into it that would be my only complaint    finally puss in boots is a really mature animated film and has to be the best from the universe yet
Aug 31 2023,positive,i love this movie soooooooooooooooo muchhh it absolutely exceeded my expection i came in the theater just because my nieces wanted to watch it and i came out absolutely amazed the animation and art direction of the movie is spectacular and the story connects so well must watch 1000

Aug 7 2023,positive,best one by far of the shrek spinoffs
Aug 7 2023,negative,the worst one by far
Aug 6 2023,positive,such a leap up from the last movie  amazing story with a darker tone then most animated movies  while still keeping the characters charm and the fairy tale aspects of the world  the character of death is excellent and is not really a villain in my opinion  he shows puss the value of his last life through raw fear which is cruel but effective  the comedyrelief character has depth rather then being a 1 dimensional joke  and the ending makes me weirdly exited for the sequel considering were its going    because of the darker tone the movie is not suited for children  but as someone who grew up with the franchise its great to see the franchise grow up with its audience

Jul 17 2023,positive,aight lemme cook rq this is the best animated movie i have seen since up this movie is deep as hell looking into the spirit of every character from death himself to the side characters
Jul 17 2023,positive,i thought the movie is refreshing it carries the same vibe as the recent spiderverse movie vibrant colours and never bored
Jul 17 2023,positive,from the beginning you can see the upgrade in the animation that they did in this movie when compared to the first one in the same way the story has much more meaning and the main characters as well as the secondary ones contain a complete development in their trajectory perrito ends up winning our hearts with his innocence the endend left me with a very big illusion
Jul 16 2023,positive,this is a really good movie the art is amazing
Jul 16 2023,positive,the hype is mostly real for this surprising animated feature puss in boots was nothing to write home about back when it came out it was a solid movie no doubt but this time around the stakes are higher and puss is a wily veteran everything is just more fun and action packed the animation is also breathtaking at times with unique handdrawn segments the villains can be questionable depending on how one views it but as a whole the last wish is a huge win for dreamworks and may even set up another shrek film
Jul 16 2023,positive,it is the most magnificent animation of my life
Jul 16 2023,negative,are you people blind how can this be called a childrens movie it is evil beyond imagination the wolf alone is demonic and all that witchcraft and death then you ask why is my child having nightmares  why is my child acting out why is my child saying bad words make no mistake this movie is demonic and has evil written all over it as a parent we all need to be aware of what our children watch and let in our homes it is saddening to see how this is the number 1 movie on netflix because parents do not care to understand the evil behind what their children watch if your child has started to act differently or is always scared beware of what they are watching this industry is going down and its about time
Jul 15 2023,positive,this is the final chapter but certainly not the least one banderas voice has so much charisma itll blow you away  this is a must see
Jul 15 2023,positive,now here is a movie that can make you feel a lot of feeling in just under 2 hours
Jul 15 2023,positive,has everything a great villain interesting character development unique animation the people who worked on this really cared and it showed best animated movie of the year easily
Jul 15 2023,positive,who wrote this the dialogue for one thing is on a level never seen before even from live action entertainment dont get me started with death incredible and the jiminy cricket character had me rofl
Jul 15 2023,positive,this movie is awesome the animation is good the acting is good and the music is good as well i would like to see a tv series based off of this movie with the animation 1010
Jul 14 2023,positive,i was surprised how much i liked this movie i put this on for my son when it became available on netflix and ended up watching the whole thing with him loved the artistic animation and excellent depiction of death i always loved shrek 2 growing up and this is the best thing to come out of the franchise since 1010 dreamworks
Jul 14 2023,positive,owthis movie had me tearing up a couple times this is an amazing movie and the only ones that are keeping you from one of the most amazing movie experiences you will ever have is sadly you everyone should watch this movie it teaches a really strong lessons in here beautiful story great music and fantastic art and minds of dreamworks have made puss in boots the last wish my favorite movie ive ever seen there is nothing wrong with this movie at all many blessings and praise the lord and creator
Jul 14 2023,positive,a perfect moviewith action and humorthe first was boring but this sequel was amazing
Jul 13 2023,positive,simply a reinvention of the shrek franchise and certainly a villain that gives you nightmares
Jul 11 2023,positive,i dont even need to explain why this movie gets 5 stars from me
Jul 11 2023,positive,whilst i enjoyed the first puss in boots 12 years ago no one was pining for a sequel especially with the shrek ip having cooled off in the meantime so i had little expectations or intention to see it when it arrived in the cinemas last year kudos then to its writing and directing team to find the courage and a fresh angle to tackle this which manages to reinvigorate an old perhaps even onenote character and brings pathos and some fantastically rendered visuals to go with it that almost made me wish i had seen it on a bigger screen refocusing and reimagining antonio banderass puss as an existential character facing his own mortality after squandering 8 of his 9 lives within a fairytale world where goldilocks and the 3 bears cheekily voiced by florence pugh olivia colman and ray winstone are a cockney crime family and john mulaneys jack horner represents the big corporate baddie the story is essentially one extended wacky racestyle chase to get a wish from a fallen star in an enchanted forest where the visual department is unleashed to delightfully creative effects now i get why quite rightly so this was nominated for an oscar earlier this year
Jul 11 2023,positive,the animation in this movie and story are great the characters are so fun and it is better than the original
Jul 10 2023,positive,good message entertaining characters funny jokes  entertaining for kids and adults alike

Jul 6 2023,positive,it was perfect perfect everything right down to the last minute detail    the humour the plot the characters  dreamworks did what they are good at making great animations very much looking forward to the next one
Jul 6 2023,positive,perfection thats all this is if you think this is bad then you clearly dont have taste for good movies its absolutely fresh its got everything the choice of villains the choice of characters its all in here youve got 3 villains youve got the more kindhearted redeemable villain whos actually portrayed really nicely youve got just a classic old evil villain nothing else and youve got a crazy unbeatable force not going to spoil any names but the main villain who technically isnt even a villain is probably the best or one of the best villains dreamworks has ever made even though there are very few scenes of him it feels like hes in the movie all the time the plot is good the acting is good the jokes are good this movie is a masterpiece one of the best movies made by dreamworks looking forward to kung fu panda 4 so overall this movie is really really good 100 recommend to everyone who hasnt seen it
Jul 6 2023,positive,didnt know how much i missed movies with live lessons and morals that were layered in the subtext to well no much better than expected

Jul 5 2023,positive,pretty good movie family enjoyed it
Jul 5 2023,positive,im laughing because i didnt expect to enjoy it so much i cannot believe i am about to write such a genuine and indepth on freaking puss in boots of all movies   firstly puss in boots the last wish had the trademark unbelievable wit and humor of the previous movies with john mulaney as one of the voice actors the already hilarious script became so much better     the character arc was incredible although i may be biased as a sucker for the arrogant character and his romantic dynamic with kitty was one of the most enjoyable straight romances ive seen recently it was just imperfect and genuine enough while also being wellbalanced as a friendship and partnership   perrito of course is impossible not to love and maintains a complicated story despite the initial comedic relief impression he gives the multiple dimensions to the characters was an instant green flag for this film    ive seen this talked about a lot and the way they conveyed a panic attack in puss was perfectly executed in my opinion not simply with the way his friends and himself handled the anxiety but they artistic choices as well  ill admit this is what i wanted to talk about the most i was so impressed i wanted to cry ive seen the style used here popping up in more places over the past few years one example being spiderman into the spiderverse where they play with 2d and 3d designs frame rates and camera angles to shake up the conventional cgi animation that combined with the beautiful color schemes and auditory techniques such as the ringing and muffled sounds whenever a character is struck hard or dissociating made for a gorgeously immersive experience the use of visual symmetry and dynamics such as all the characters at different points of the star made it all the more satisfying    i dont need to point out how cleverly death was designed but im already on a roll so why not his design with the ghostlywhiteversusblack color pallet paired with his twin scythes lended themselves to the traditional reaper technique but there were so many more clever details the way his eyes flashed the haunting whistle and his unnervingly normal voice and demeanor were all techniques that made such a brilliant villain    finally i noticed much more linguistic representation in this movie it may seem small but personally even as an american who can just barely speak spanish seeing most of the characters alternate between english and fluent spanish added cultural representation i didnt know i needed to see it made me so happy to see and in my opinion added yet another layer to the characters in the movie    i have to reiterate i did not expect to be so impressed and delighted by this movie im almost embarrassed to be writing this review with the same vocabulary and conviction as a damn college essay but knowing that good animation and storytelling is still thriving is really all i care about now i just have to convince my family to watch it
Jul 4 2023,positive,fun film that works for kiddos and adults has some real heart and a good story good action and plenty of adventure good life lessons to draw from the story very relatable
Jul 4 2023,positive,the unexpected sequel to the shrek spin off film was gorgeous with beautiful spiderverse style animation witty humor unique characters and is just a fun time for young and old alike
Jul 4 2023,positive,great movie best puss in boots movie so far the animation and plot and its storytelling is fantastic i just really like how they build this fantastical world that is not afraid to take things from other fairy tales just great
Jul 3 2023,positive,what a great movie amazing
Jul 3 2023,positive,puss in boots the last wish is a beautiful movie that tackles the topic of anxiety death living life in the moment and excepting what you lack in a very serious realistic and mature tone that left me absolutely speachless whilst walking out of the theater there isnt too much that hasnt been said but its interesting story and gorgeous visuals will keep anyone engaged with the movie the perfection of puss in boots the last wish is how this movie does not have a target demographic and that anyone no matter their age will be able to appreciate it for what its worth this is an absolute must see movie as this is dreamworks best movie to date for its lovable characters mature story and its impactful messages that blew most peoples expectations including mine out of the water i have no issues with it masterpiece in writing and a movie that anyone can learn from

Jun 16 2023,positive,i love the story and i love puss in boots however the comic books animation was awful it took me three attempts and some serious self discipline to make it through the entirety of the movie if it were a show and that was the style fine but this was the second part of the movie series and it was choppy and distracting
Jun 16 2023,positive,good story and jokes nice visuals and great music score unexpectedly also emotional and touching great movie
Jun 15 2023,positive,not the wittiiest childrens cartoon but very entertaining nonetheless mainly carried by the incredible chemistry between antonio banderas  salma hayak    the action sequences are colorful and well choreographed the humour while skewing towards a younger audience isnt completely juvenile plus this film is beautiful reminiscent of the spiderverse style    overall really enjoyable 8610 b  like top gun maverick this film has no business being so much better than the original     3d 8510 definitely watch this in 3d if you get the chance best ive seen since shang chi but i still need to watch avatar twow

May 23 2023,positive,great story great characters great animation great cinematography and great voice acting
May 22 2023,positive,it was one of the great surprises of that year they daringly reinvented it for a new visual approach with a story about behind your desire that manages to surprise even the most evil with animations as the characters are incredibly charismatic and win our sympathy in the right measure dreamworks has proven that yes it can make a nearly perfect puss in boots movie its an even better spinoff sequel than some movies in our beloved shrek franchise
May 22 2023,positive,with animation reminiscent of the style of spiderman into the spiderverse this movie broke from dreamworks traditional approach and also from the rest of the shrek and puss in boots franchise to deliver an exceptional movie this one shone in all the ways that the first puss in boots did not the characters hit harder even ones that should have been wellestablished back then and the story felt elevated on a plane the other one was just not on this movie pleasantly surprised me even with the high expectations i went into it with i highly recommend this film
May 22 2023,positive,ive been looking into florence pughs filmography and realized she has a small part in this movie ordinarily i wanted to skip this never being a fan of the shrek movies but this is a spinoff it doesnt have mike meyers and eddie murphys annoying voiceovers plus i do enjoy antonio banderas movies from time to time not to mention disney is in a bad place so why not check out the competition    puss in boots the jovial adventurer from the shrek sequel has gone forward since those early days with his spinoff but after nearly ten years he returns for a sequel the brave cat ends up magically dying and coming back to life only to be told that he is on the last of his nine lives and should retire from his adventures but this is puss in boots and if there is an opportunity to start over again he will take it when a magical power known as the wishing star map has been found and he wants his nine lives back but there are others in his way from foes to friends on the way to redeem the wishing stars wish    as i mentioned before i am not a fan of the shrek series but i love puss in boots banderas chews the scenery with his voice as the legendary feline hero alongside plenty of other voiceovers from salma hayek ray winstone and florence pugh i got to say that dreamworks makes a great movie better than anything disney is making nowadays
May 20 2023,negative,the framerate made the movie unwatcheable
May 19 2023,positive,good funny animated movie nothing unbelievably great about it or like my favourite animated movie ever but its for sure a movie to watch if you need a laugh but in the end what makes this movie work is how mysterious the wolf was and how funny puss and perrito are
May 19 2023,positive,it was so good its even better than the first one the cgi animation is great and dont froget with the caracthers death is like one of the coldest vilain ever made
May 19 2023,positive,how can a sequel to a secondary character movie be so good
May 19 2023,positive,this is my second favorite movie in 2023
May 19 2023,positive,this movie is amazing suitable for family great time watching it
May 19 2023,positive,movie is great nothing but action and lots of humor
May 18 2023,positive,there isnt that much that i can say about this movie that hasnt been said already by people on youtube or other reviewers on the site this movie is just all around good on top of giving puss a facelift that he desperately needed even if we didnt know it takes a cue from animation and innovates in such a way that makes the fights look spectacular and the characters fluid the entire movie was a joy from start to finish and if i ever have children this is one of the first movies they are seeing when they hit the age of 10   all of the villains are spectacular the main characters are great and the story isnt too loaded down with baggage to properly fly the movie is not only a feast for the eyes but it is also a engaging story experience one that i found compelling and that resonated with me   if you are superstitious or of a more conservative background the movie might not be as good to you due to it offending your existing values otherwise this movie is a must see for people of all ages and should be used as an example for good storytelling in classrooms
May 18 2023,positive,i really enjoyed this movie my wife and daughter all loved it as well   definitely worth seeing
May 18 2023,positive,this one caught me by surprise it was visually engaging with a slightly different art style to older dreamworks shrek universe movies and really made you care about the storyline and characters as an adult viewer really great job
May 18 2023,positive,i need to learn how to whistle
May 18 2023,negative,was the story great no was the animation great no   it was a terrible mild movie what is a disappointment for a character that is loved by so many fans the animation was soo diffrent than the other movies of puss in boots that it really annoyed me the whole movie the eyes look terrible of all the characters really flat with no live behind them they should fire the animation team
May 18 2023,positive,holy freaking moly   this movie deserves all its praise the writers did a phenomenal job and the animation the animation wow so refreshing and beautiful to me this is the best film of 2022 and better than what disney had come up with for the last 5 years   well done dreamworks   all the praise for this film is so deserved
May 18 2023,positive,went in openminded and was utterly blown away animation stellar voice acting fantastic and jack horner was an amazing villain you must see this film
May 17 2023,positive,puss in boots the last wish is perfect
May 16 2023,positive,this animated movie should be taught in film schools on how to make a regular story great and how to make your characters greater probably the best animated movie since coco  at least to me
May 15 2023,positive,kept hearing how good this movie was and sheesh they werent wrong
May 14 2023,positive,a perfect movie that perfectly balances all the aspects that every great movie should have

May 14 2023,positive,this movie is fire asf
May 14 2023,positive,great family film lots of emotional ups and downs for the characters and growth
May 13 2023,positive,really great much more mature and nuanced than your average childrens film the characters had meaningful arcs and this led to a satisfying conclusion the animation was gorgeous and the voice cast were perfect     you know you have something really special when adults are impressed by the wisdom on offer in the story and a 2 year old can also have a blast very excited to see what they do next
May 13 2023,positive,this movie has the exact visualization of a panic attack

May 13 2023,positive,great plot and loved all of the characters
May 12 2023,positive,i didnt step into the theater with particular expectations and i walked out nearly bawling its a gem its soulful wholesome fun and beautifully animated it unpretentiously tugs on the heartstrings by tackling some of the biggest adult themes like the dread of mortality midlife crisis and realising the value of the family you choose or chose you the editing and pacing also works well and isnt wasteful just to pump up the runtime one of the must watch films of the year

Apr 30 2023,positive,wow very cat i liked how the backstories add more depth to all the characters i was surprised that this was actually funny like when they come close to swearing no more fart jokes as for the visuals i enjoyed how they changed his character design  i think he looks more cartoonish i also agreed with the choice to make the framerate slightly choppier in areas to mimic a stop motion effect overall it had a good message albeit a little corny of course there was your classic 3rd act breakup and misunderstanding the resolution worked out easier than i would expect no surprises in the ending despite this i still think its a beautiful movie i definitely want to watch the original now
Apr 30 2023,positive,the biggest and best animated movie of 2023
Apr 30 2023,positive,puss in boots the last wish is tightly written gorgeously animated funny and actionpacked the character work is superb old and new characters have compelling arcs and no one takes up more screen time than necessary the film also gets a lot of mileage from its fantastical setting serving the characters while moving the plot forward  its very efficient its rare that any movie animated or not is both as thematically rich and generally wellexecuted as this one im glad its getting the recognition it deserves
Apr 30 2023,positive,awesome movie this is how movies should be made
Apr 30 2023,positive,rewatched it and honestly its good the dog is cheesy and has a cheesy voice yet hes a good addition to the franchise

Apr 26 2023,positive,incredible animation and a genuinely great story make this my favourite animated movie of the past few years ive lost count how many times ive rewatched it
Apr 25 2023,positive,this movie is an absolute must watch puss in boots the last wish gives everything in a movie that i can ask for a great plot characters and growth of the main character a great sequel for my extended review i will speak on aspects of the movie so if you do not want to be spoiled please do not read first i would like to talk about puss and his growth as a character i absolutely love the way puss goes from a prideful arrogant and irresponsible cat to something more mature and less reckless  he learns that he is not indestructible and that he feels fear through this realization puss does not run away from his problems anymore and decides to instead go head first into his biggest fear death which leads me to my second aspect of the film the antagonist in the movie there is a bundle of side antagonist who actually have a purpose and fit the story well each with their own motives and the writers did a great job explaining what they were after and why in such a short time the lead antagonist death was by far the best aspect of not only the film but also the development of puss he shows that puss is both vulnerable and scared which leads him to face his fears and fight death head on such a great antagonist to a great film i would suggest leaving the franchise as it is and to not make a third movie so that they cant potentially ruin everything the second movie brought to the table a must see movie
Apr 25 2023,positive,the writing and animation in this story is perfection we have the blue ray and still watch it all the time never gets boring
Apr 25 2023,positive,puss in boots the last wish is an insanely good film by far one of the best animated films to release recently it is exciting funny and the story really packs a punch cannot recommend this one enough go see it
Apr 25 2023,positive,one of the best dreamworks movie the plot cinematography characters are great
Apr 25 2023,positive,a challenge to those who dare claim animation is just childs stuff it has beautiful artwork its funny heart filled and has an antagonist whos probably going to go down as one of the best animated antagonist ever i recommend it even if you dont have any children to watch with you
Apr 24 2023,positive,i cant believe this this is the best animation of the year my favorite animation of dream works this is a masterpiece
Apr 24 2023,positive,best spinoff movie ive ever seen great casting that actually makes the characters feel so real ya know plot is over the top both of the villains were amazing this is genuinely the greatest movie to end with 2022 9510
Apr 23 2023,positive,funny and hallarious a good family movie for everyone 
Apr 23 2023,positive,this film restores your faith that creativity still exists in moviemaking which is even more amazing when its a sequel  clever funny heartwarming and charmingnuff said
Apr 23 2023,positive,puss in boots is for the most part a character that grew up with his audience     with this sequel coming out an entire decade after its predecessor people definitely were not expecting this release     its a rare thing when a sequel especially a spinoff sequel is met with open arms from audiences from sightings of a mere trailer let alone an actual viewing     puss in boots has a gorgeous stylisation with a unique blend of 2d and 3d animation that makes use of bold strokes both within the literal art style and within the story beats themselves even the camera direction and angles used alongside the editing is something that seriously lends to the viewing experience    with unique character designs and bold oversaturated use of colours puss in boots the last wish is a film that isnt afraid to lean into its painterly and cartoonish roots to help convey mood and emotion within scenes in a way that does not in any way retract from the experience it alternatively lifts the viewing experience up immensely with the way in which it is done     its a film that evokes unexpected emotion from the viewer with scenes that tackle real life issues such as mental health struggles and even the concept of mortality and existential dread with a realistic and raw approach in a fashion typically not explored or portrayed in these styles of movie atleast not with the level of care and toneappropriate humour the film manages to utilise without denoting the character struggles    this film also uses an interesting story telling mechanic employed by having several characters within it that one could consider the true antagonist of the film depending on either the viewers perspective or the time within the story as it progresses the villains in this movie are all very three dimensional and the level of foreshadowing that comes alongside that is simply astounding     all in all a film definitely worth a watch and then another to catch all of the details you might have missed the first time thanks to that pesky yet effective foreshadowing
Apr 23 2023,positive,best animated movie of all time and my new favourite movie of all time
Apr 22 2023,positive,it has been a long time since a new aesthetically pleasing villain was introduced in an animation film whilst the past puss in boots movies have been fantastic this latest installation throws the previous into the dust the animation style is stellar vibrant and the character art is crisp and flourishing to see with the vfx effects     in a more in depth dive into the films pacing at first the giant being set up as the villain but immediately losing to puss set up an interesting perspective of who is the villain whilst many would argue death is the main antagonist he also equally isnt in a sense that his existence sets up pusss own character development death isnt evil he is instead a major factor in a characters growth     overall the film takes you along the ride of seeing puss not only as a character grow but also face his own fears as well as establish a bond with others as well
Apr 22 2023,positive,puss in boots the last wish is a terrific fantasyadventure film spinning off from the shrek universe it follows the story of puss the charming fugitive feline who following a scary encounter with death decides to stop his adventuring as he finds out he only has one life remaining soon after his journey begins one again as he finds out the mystical magic wishing star exists with the ability to grant his one wish  the wish to reclaim his nine lives of course     this however is not an easy mission as other wellknown fairy tale characters with a twist also battle for the wish overall the epic quest is filled with hilarious hearty and fearful moments with an incredibly fleshed out storyline jampacked with emotion and meaning the film successfully explores themes of friendship courage love and ultimately the beauty that one life has to offer  it is perfectly paced with the main characters having sufficient and meaningful screen time as well as an incredible dynamic with each other and each scene having an importance and relevance the animation is phenomenal and visually striking and the action scenes are fast paced smoothly transitioned and spread out to keep the film intriguing it is a oneofakind film which has the ability to appeal to both kids and adults    i would recommend this fantastic film to people of all ages as this level of storytelling and striking animation is rare to find in todays cinema
Apr 22 2023,positive,debatably one of my favorite films of 2022 didnt go with high expectations and left wishing i seen this movie opening weekend great watch for kids and adults  with life themes flowing through out the film cant wait for shrek 5

Apr 18 2023,positive,its just a work of art
Apr 17 2023,positive,i dont usually watch sequels without having seen the first movie but my family always goes to the movies on christmas and this was our best option i was not expecting to like this movie as much as i did especially because i have grown tired of spinoffs sequels and multiverses at the box office however this movie delightfully surprised me and is great on its own i loved how like the shrek franchise other fairy tale characters are incorporated and modified in unique ways like goldilocks and the three bears the animation was entrancing and i enjoyed how the storyline addressed dark issues such as death overall this is a great film for children and adults alike and i am excited to rewatch
Apr 17 2023,positive,i loved everything ratings must be 100

Apr 16 2023,positive,best film of the year so far i cant remember laughing so hard the characters were fun developed and all contributed in meaningful ways to the overall story the writing was well done and with respect to all the films that came before this one i was not expecting to be blown away but this film really out did itself and set the bar for what films should strive for

Apr 16 2023,positive,a beautiful and energetic animation well worth watching 
Apr 16 2023,positive,just a great film all around
Apr 16 2023,positive,it may be animated but its not a kids only movie it has funny moments for kids and more serious themes for teenagers and adults it somehow managed to get 3 villains in the movie and theyre almost perfect it is funny when it needs to be and sad or scary when it needs to be and the comicrelief side character actually impacts the story and the wolf is scary as hell definetly a must watch

Apr 15 2023,positive,perfection for all ages  the animation is creative the jokes are actually funny and the protagonists all have a genuine and heartwarming arc  this movie never steps on an emotional moment for a cheap laugh and commits to what it is trying to say about family friendship and living in the moment

Apr 14 2023,positive,an absolute gem dreamworks wrote a great story with one of the coldest villains in history and it was all worth the wait i forgot the entire plot for the first film going into this one so i just thought i would go ahead and enjoy it no matter what and i did just that this movie is a story of comedy friendship and adventure with a great lesson on making sure you live life to the fullest and dont take it for granted perfect for the kids and a great choice for family movie night
Apr 14 2023,positive,the best movie of all time
Apr 14 2023,positive,the witty humor and interesting animation style was fun id recommend this movie for smaller children great for the family
Apr 14 2023,positive,im death straight up
Apr 14 2023,positive,the whole film is like a colourful explosion of passion and quality blows the original out of the water and pretty much everything else animated that has come out recently the last time i was this much in awe by an animated film was frozen 2 its hard to find anything bad about this movie all the characters are instantly memorable which is fantastic death takes the cake though he was just so damn cool give the person who designed him a trophy or something
Apr 14 2023,positive,the delivery from antonio banderas sounds like its getting old but dreamworks resurrects this franchise with a sparkling new coat of paint and more winsome interpretations of classic fairytales for a lightningpaced new adventure that comes with surprisingly dark themes 
Apr 14 2023,positive,great story telling really enjoyed it

Apr 13 2023,positive,the movie was one of the best movies this decade you can feel the time and effort love and care put into this movie it has a beautiful blend of comedy action adventure and cats the plot was creative who would think of a cat who is on his last life and is literally running from death which is used metaphorically
Apr 13 2023,positive,a perfect movie this movie is better than anything disney did in the last 20 years
Apr 12 2023,positive,what a great film its fun exciting serious and sometimes scary the film manages to capture so many emotions for such a short film the animation is one of the best i have every seen and is very stylized please watch this
Apr 12 2023,positive,a rarity in hollywood today  a movie that entertains  probably the best film ever made in the shrek series or at least of the puss in boots series  ostensibly a kids film this has something for everyone  my teenagers wife and i all loved it it has wild half anime visual style crazy action scenes fairy tale craziness although that shtick has dropped off since the original shrek  the humor is not wall to wall but organic and almost always lands  but more importantly it has more mature themes of coming to grips with mortality and life priorities  it is an emotional roller coaster and really well done  yeah it is a little cartoonish sure but it is a kids film
Apr 12 2023,positive,good i love cats so much 
Apr 12 2023,positive,this movie was amazing
Apr 11 2023,negative,if i thought this had anything to do with the original fairy tale i was seriously mistaken apart from very few witty references the mafia etc this was just a mindless collection of characters crashing into something or beating each other up halfway through the show my daughter said daddy i have enough of this can we go home now  well done my girl for not being fascinated by onscreen violence even if this may have put you off going to the cinema for the rest of your life if i could add some rotten cucumbers i would
Apr 11 2023,positive,really good fun movie to watch with kids
Apr 11 2023,positive,my whole family loved it these movies never disappoint funny action filled and heart warming moments through out
Apr 11 2023,positive,i love this movie my favorite part is when the cricket was mad at jack and said jacckkkkkkkkkkkk your horrible your wish is horriblleee youre horriblllleeeeeee
Apr 11 2023,positive,i literally cannot think of a single thing to complain about this is the best movie ive seen in a long while im about to go watch it again the characters are interesting the animation is gorgeous i am wondering whether they developed a new way to animate fur cause ive never seen it like this before you can easily watch this without having seen the first puss in boots movie  also no spoilers but how the dark forest is connected to the map is super cool
Apr 11 2023,positive,its teaching us what anxiety it is
Apr 11 2023,positive,ill be honest i didnt want to watch this movie it just didnt appeal to me but my high school students kept telling me how great it was finally i cracked and i am happy to say they were right i am so happy i watched this film it was a deep well written visually compelling movie that has some really great moments and characters life lessons are learned in this movie and characters actually grow for me the wolf and goldilocks really stand out but almost every character is worthy of a shout out this is one of the best animated movies out there
Apr 11 2023,positive,i love the movie its one of the best animated films that dreamworks has created
Apr 10 2023,positive,what a joy   my kids absolutely loved this   solid watch for kids and parents

Apr 10 2023,positive,where the fk was shrek
Apr 10 2023,positive,honestly the best movie i saw that year this is a kids movie but it has so many mature themes like personifying death puss aka catt and coping with abandonment and rejection perrito aka dog and rejection kitty by far one of my favorite movies now
Apr 10 2023,positive,a beautiful animated film that took inspiration from sonys into the spiderverse the puss in boots sequel is miles better than the first film with a villain 10x better and a more mature and deep story that fits along the lines of shrek 2 the writing teaches the main character of his sense of mortality and his lack of care for his safety the daredevil cat learns how to value life and the people that love him that he must cherish because no one is immortal and the time we have is valuable
Apr 10 2023,positive,friends we finnaly made it i did see the movie and it was a great movie you must see it
Apr 10 2023,positive,this movie is amazing  it takes things to the next level  omg the villains are soooo good in this movie
Apr 10 2023,positive,dream works pleasantly surprised me with this one i didnt expect much but puss in boots the last wish an absolutely adorable and hilarious animated movie has some deep themes and messages behind it as well as its main antagonist  death theres something much to talk about but its simply the best movie of 2023 and one of my favourite animated movies so far 100 recommended
Apr 9 2023,positive,the movie was amazing the mix with 2d and 3d animation was great which spiderverse did the same the soundtrack was great i even put some of the songs in spotify the story and the morals were great with puss changing for the better the villains were also great puss in boots protagonist who had a great character development kitty softpaws being badass and sarcastic i really like her relationship with puss in boots theyre so cute together perrito who i thought was gonna the funny annoying dog but i was wrong he wasnt annoying jack horner being funny he is just straight up evil he knows that and he doesnt care which is funny and of course death the wolf was scary and cool it was the first movie that i watched twice in cinema which says something cant wait for shrek 5 hope theyll use the same animation and have an interesting plot    i really wish that we would see kitty and puss getting married in shrek 5

Apr 9 2023,positive,a formulaic adventure little in the way of wit or wonder no surprises and predictable outcomes for an undemanding primary school child perhaps

Apr 6 2023,positive,puss in boots 2 is like the most funniest and entertaining movie ive ever seen
Apr 6 2023,positive,this may just be my favorite movie of all time not the best movie the prince of egypt and a beautiful day in the neighborhood are the best movies ive seen but puss in boots the last wish is a mustwatch even as someone who didnt like the first movie i think this movie soars in every aspect puss kitty and perrito are a great cast of main characters each of which feel grounded and entertaining at the same time this movie having 3 villains could have made it feel overstuffed and like it was doing too much but no one villain takes time from the others and theyre all so well written jack horner is a refreshing villain he is completely irredeemable and evil something that disney should do more with its villains if they ever decide to have an actual villain again goldilocks and the 3 bears are incredibly sympathetic well written characters theyre some of my favorites wolf was so threatening generating chills any time he was onscreen the animation of this movie is so stylized and gorgeous and puts what the first puss in boots did to shame the music is great fearless hero is one of my favorite songs from a movie theres a reason everyone remembers this song after seeing this movie i could go on and on but you get the point puss in boots the last wish is an uncontested masterpiece by far my favorite dreamworks movie
Apr 6 2023,neutral,this movie was pretty funny the graphics were ok the only thing is that the storyline was confusing to understand and didnt quite understand why some random characters appeared in this movie

Apr 5 2023,positive,a top tier comedy movie laugh after laugh after laugh plus the animation is excellent 1010
Apr 5 2023,positive,not full 55 stars because i think that the only issue this film had was the fact that it took too long time to get the adventure going like while i enjoyed puss trying to retire at this weird cat home it did feel like we were there a little bit too long and i did wanted the plot to start moving but once it got moving it was an incredibly engaging experience that shattered my expectations completly not just exciting but also surprisingly mature and thoughtful and sometimes thrilling it really is the package and eaisly the best animated film of 2022
Apr 5 2023,positive,this movie has a mix of good things pleasing animation exciting action sequences compelling characters excellent antagonists a surprisingly poignant theme and masterful storytelling there is just so little to complain about easily one of the best dreamworks movies

Apr 5 2023,negative,far too scary for young children not suitable or particularly enjoyable or even funny contains unnecessary horror distress weapons and blood
Apr 4 2023,positive,nearly perfect imho this movie should have won the oscar for best animated film ive seen pinocchios netflix movie and i agree it was a very good animated film and they did an amazing job but puss and boots the last wish was an original story that had me laughing and crying all at the same time one of the best in the shrek franchise the reason it did not win an oscar was because its animated style in some parts were too much like spidermans multiverse animation movie which wasnt too good a part from that the movie as a whole was an a

Apr 1 2023,positive,theres almost nothing wrong with this film i enjoyed everything from the stunning spiderman into the spiderverse inspired animation style to the humor especially from big jack horner to the plot and characters one thing i dont like as much with this movie is the fact that there is 3 villains 6 if you think about it so i feel like 1 of them could have been unessecary even though the movie never felt crammed another thing is the predictable ending spoilers puss and kitty both give up the wish at the end and the message is everything you need is already in front of you good for all ages maybe a bit scary for little kids at times
Apr 1 2023,positive,so good it made me make a rotten tomatoes account just to give it 5 stars

Mar 26 2023,positive,this movie was a wonderful surprise too me beautiful animated and a great story
Mar 26 2023,positive,w dreamworks   l disney
Mar 26 2023,positive,spoiler warning tldr at the bottom    this is what animated kids movies should be like behind all of the bright colours of the gorgeous animation making all of the action scenes an absolute spectacle to feast your eyes onto is a simple plot with an absolutely massive impact     the story is light hearted enough so kids can get enjoyment out of it but it also treats its audience with maturity not playing safe and having the bravery to insert extremely deep messages one of which is the overarching theme of mortality and how we need to appreciate what we have    this theme is represented beautifully through its characters the protagonist puss in boots learns how he has taken his lives for granted he learns this through the other characters such as perrito     at first glance he seems like the cliché annoying side character for comic relief but turns out being a warm friendly and extremely likeable little chap the fact that he does not have a wish along with some other character traits shows us and puss how he is content with the life he has and only looks forward to his simple dreams letting the rest develop along the way his dream is to become a therapy dog which is an important detail to note further into the film     of course i cannot review this movie without mentioning death one of the best animated villains i have seen in a while he shows puss his hatred towards him for taking his lives for granted and enjoys inflicting fear into other people in his introduction scene he is extremely close to taking puss final life coming as close to a scar on his forehead with one drop of blood slowly creeping down to his shocked face another example of this films maturity in this scene we see puss experience true fear for the first time in his life as he is petrified of dying right there right then this is the moment he comes to realise how much he has taken for granted and it was all at the fault of this menacing wolf character    but it doesnt stop there he constantly torments puss showing up throughout random parts of the film in which every appearance send massive chills down puss and my spine with his truly uncanny whistle     one of these appearances leads to what is in my opinion one of the most powerful scenes in the film puss begins to run away in a state of absolute to panic before coming to a stop we see that he is struggling to breathe and his vision is blurry perrito is the only one there and without any dialogue perrito simply rests his head on puss chest and in a slow decent into calmness puss regains his control perrito has completed his dream of being a therapy dog the shear realism of this scene along with the mature dealing of the situation is what makes this scene and this film in general truly one of a kind     to finalise we also have many other great characters most notably goldi the three bears the redeemable villains who learn to appreciate their family and big jack horner the pure evil villain who does not appreciate what he has at all to which he learns to consequences overall he is an extremely funny character with a charming evil to him all of these characters are balanced out perfectly through the films perfect pacing nothing seems to drag on at all    tldr  this movie is an incredible creation all the characters are amazing in their respected ways the animation is a true spectacle of passion and creativity and the plot is simple but truly impactful with the balance of light hearted humour and the downright mature themes     personal experience  i have never felt so much towards a film before the mature themes especially hit hard and really made me look over how i spend my one life i would honestly not recommend this film to really young audiences because this film is best experienced when you truly understand the mature tones and messages i absolutely adored this film and i hope you did as well    ps this is my first proper review of a film so sorry if some parts are a bit confusing and the pacing on this is no where near as good as the films lol theres so much to say but i dont want this to be too long but still if you made it this far even if skipping to the tldr thanks for reading hope i expressed my opinions well enough
Mar 26 2023,positive,it was actually so funny
Mar 26 2023,positive,pretty good kept my six year old entertained with minimal squirming in his seat
Mar 26 2023,positive,lots of moral message there i like it so much
Mar 26 2023,positive,i saw puss in boots the last wish with my sister yesterday and it was an amazing movie there were a lot of characters that i couldnt keep track of but i liked the animation style and the story was really fun i really loved perrito the dog and also kitty softpaws and puss in boots
Mar 26 2023,positive,excellent weve seen it twice in the theater so far loved the storyline the animation the soundtrack and the graphics very emotional too youll laugh a lot youll at times be on the edge of your seat with suspense and youll cry for sure happy tears   puss in boots is at his very best in this movie also got really attached to perrito and hope to see him again in the next installment
Mar 26 2023,positive,without a doubt one of the best movies of 2023 good for all ages
Mar 25 2023,positive,a very engaging film for funny and one of the best kid freindly movies ive seen in a long time with to notch aniation
Mar 25 2023,positive,second best movie of all time shrek is the best but thats why this is in 2nd death puss and jack rivived this spinoff series
Mar 25 2023,positive,i watched this film with my friend and let me tell you this is probably the best movie of 2022 at least in my top three because this movie is not just a kids film its a film that anyone can enjoy i dont think i really have any real big problems with this film because the animation is super vibrant the characters are lively even the villains jack and death are some of the best animated villains or even just villains in general that i have seen in a long time theres a big complaint about this movie being too crowded but i think its just fine the first half really makes it feel like a puss in boots film but by the end it really flashes out all the other characters in waze i didnt expect and i love this film for doing that i really dont know how shrek five would top this but if it does then respect because this film was incredible i dont think its as good as shrek two but it is darn close also i watch this film with my friend after i watch this film youll never guess what i watched after i watch this film again for a second time its that good 910
Mar 25 2023,positive,great movie too many commercials before movie began
Mar 25 2023,positive,surprisingly good  i dont think as good as shrek but still good
Mar 25 2023,negative,puss in boots the last wish underwhelmed under performed used anime looking animation in several scenes it was not worth my time rent or buy the 2011 1st movie
Mar 25 2023,positive,this movie is the best sequel that we could have gotten from this character the animation style inspired from into the spiderverse the great lesson this movie teaches and the cast really gives it their all even death is the best antagonist we have gotten so far in the year
Mar 25 2023,positive,an incredible movie visually stunning very witty shares a good message genuinely funny and shows a side to puss we never saw before the bleeped out language was some of the funniest jokes of the movie made me cry three times the animation of the action scenes was fantastic it played around with the frame rate and had 2d elements in it it realistically showed what being scared or having a panic attack feels like the antagonist is masterfully designed and genuinely scary this movie is seriously a mustsee for any age
Mar 25 2023,positive,i liked it i really liked it i liked it a lot
Mar 25 2023,positive,clean movie my teens and preteen enjoyed it immensely fun characters without cliche stereotypes my kids loved the way the story was told and loved the animation just a fun story without politics my son was very entertained a tall order
Mar 25 2023,positive,a dark and expertly crafted film for all ages  it feels like a movie made for adults that kids can also enjoy
Mar 25 2023,negative,im disappointed in the amount of cursing in the movie and several other things they say what the hell crap x2 and they have actual bleeps multiple times like someone is cursing in an adult movie the characters tell each other to shut up  and call each stupid and idiot the theme of death was too strong for my 5yo and they show blood from a facial wound twice this is a disney movie one character was death and one character said that he was dead on the inside all completely inappropriate
Mar 24 2023,negative,i cant believe we paid money to see this they kept talking about murder and death like its nothing there are many references inferring that someone will be hurt i horrific ways im disappointed that majority of people dont see anything wrong with hearing shut up in a movie for kids and seeing pg rated violence this is not even close to shrek which was a really cute innocent and funny movie for all ages
Mar 24 2023,positive,humor both kids and adults can enjoy
Mar 24 2023,positive,i loved the movie it has great animation and a great story i loved the messages he conveys and everyone can identify with the characters the wolf is just perfect and yes he is very scary he has a certain psychological pressure and that brings a great sense of fear and terror and he was portrayed very well congratulations on this film
Mar 24 2023,positive,lokey is one of the best movies ive ever seen i watched with my family and we all liked it its a great movie that you have to give a watch
Mar 24 2023,positive,yes go watch this movie everyone will enjoy it not just the kids
Mar 24 2023,positive,i dont really know where this came from but this movie which was very clearly created to be for kids has some real material built around solid bones and that wolf was genuinely unnerving
Mar 24 2023,positive,ages 12 to 60 in our group and we all loved it  animation different and exciting and great thememoral to the story
Mar 24 2023,positive,death is the absolute best villain that is all i have to say
Mar 24 2023,positive,meh i didnt love it it lost my attention eventually
Mar 24 2023,positive,too loud too little plot substance substituted by action
Mar 23 2023,positive,funny and good story
Mar 23 2023,positive,fairy tale lore meets surprisingly mature drama the last wish could have sacrificed the musical numbers for more action scenes but the emotion throughout the picture was able to keep me engaged with tears rolling down my face throughout
Mar 23 2023,positive,one of the best animation movies the animation the animation itself is amazing the story and the adventure is great and death is one of the best villains if not the best villain i ever saw in a animation movie he reminds me of hermonica from once upon a time in the west becuse of his whistle and strength and puss himself is vary good and antonio banderes is a great voice actor a most watch movie
Mar 23 2023,positive,immensely creative hilariously sarcastic and with so much heart to bring you to tears no matter what age    the greatest animated adventure ive seen since spiderverse  stick it to the disney man
Mar 23 2023,positive,most epic movie i have ever seen watching it made me spiritually ascend and high five god
Mar 23 2023,positive,it was perfect honestly perfect dreamworks having the thought of animating a panic attack is a whole level i dont know if they have done this before but hell this gave me goosebumps i felt bad for kitty about her life with puss in the past but they worked it out
Mar 23 2023,positive,absolutely loved the movie the movie scenes worked great with serious sad funny and exciting scenes all working very well together to many modern movies crack a joke during times meant to be serious or sincere but there are moments in this movie like the time when the puppy comforts puss that are very touching and there are no jokes or wise cracks to ruin the moments
Mar 23 2023,positive,it was a little scary at first but i love that at the end
Mar 22 2023,positive,good family movie with villians and heroes puss in boots  kitty softpaws our 4 year old grandson enjoyed it and there are funny adult references to laugh about as well reminds me of the cartoons we used to watch as kids but obviously much well produced and with great action parts
Mar 22 2023,positive,i liked the end the way they stayed together
Mar 22 2023,positive,this movie is one of the best animated movies this decade and it deserves the praise its gotten this movie is so dark and mature my favorite scene was when puss is running from death and when perrito found him snd he calms him down death is horrifying and probably one of the best villains ive ever seen  jack horner is hysterical the animation is amazing and goldilocks and the three bears were a funny and an emotional group with great character arcs perrito is a great character with funny jokes and a kind and adorable personality and his sad backstor   ive watched this movie 3 times and on my second viewing ive noticed that one of the locations in the map when perrito holds it is called the river of relaxation which is where his owners nearly drowned him trust anxiety fear and emotion is handled so well and theres a lot of things for adults to enjoy death is an extremely dark villain and there is some bleeped swearing but that makes this movie the best this movie took risks and after being stuck in hell for years hollywood doesnt respect animation they think of it as something that is only meant for kids but movies like this and many other dreamworks movies like shrek how to train your dragon kung fu panda and wallace and gromit the curse of the were rabbit and to anyone who doesnt like this masterpiece than maybe these kids movies are a little to mature for you
Mar 22 2023,positive,puss in boots the last wish is the best animated movie ive ever seen and the cast and director have nailed yet another puss in boots movie to give this movie a bad rating because of its scariness is a crime the pg rating tied to the humor and darkness of the film is to better the age appealing i would recommend looking into puss in boots as well as all the other movies tied to it made by dream works before you watch it maybe then youll realize the dark humor thats shown in previous movies that they set you up for next time grandma dont listen to your grandchildren about what they heard or saw on social media and pray for the movies downfall after the 5 year old kids come out of the theater crying
Mar 21 2023,positive,one of the best animation movie ive seen since kung fu panda i didnt know i really needed this

Mar 19 2023,positive,the movie was funny and exciting the reaper was a bit scary for kids
Mar 19 2023,positive,dude this movie was perfectly archetypal it played with valuable themes that make you actually care that villain is puurrrrrrrfect see what i did there like with the cat thing  i think i liked this equally with shrek maybe even more
Mar 19 2023,positive,this goes so hard i would recommend this for adults kids teens anyone it has good jokes the story is amazing it pretty much skews over the first movie to tell its own story while still hanging on to the lore of shrek and most of the puss in boots films it takes a character youve probably never heard of despite being a real poetry character little jack horner and turns him into a heartless villain with no tragic backstory just straight up evil and it makes his character really funny while still having other villains that have motives like goldilocks who wants to have a real family and death who wants to take pusss life because he doesnt appreciate it honestly its an amazing film with top tier animation and it is possibly the greatest dreamworks movie
Mar 19 2023,positive,i honestly dont have anything bad to say about this movie the storytelling character arch sound design were awesome but as a 3d artist myself i must say the style animation and envoriment design were so good that i would watch the movie again even on mute just to appreciate that
Mar 19 2023,positive,no need to elaborate why just know it was a masterpiece
Mar 19 2023,positive,i was skeptical as it feels like there are a million shrek puss in boots movies but this is done very well the plot is refreshing there are some emotional parts but also a lot of laughs i like how it ends with them sailing towards far far away i am excited to see what comes next
Mar 19 2023,positive,loved it  only movie that kept the attention of my 4yr old grandson   fun movie to enjoy with kids of all ages 
Mar 19 2023,positive,i am delighted with this masterpiece  incredible success in the evolution of the cats facial expressions and the principle of all animation the characters of the second plan are perfectly worked out a separate respect for the fact that they were not afraid to show a little blood for the wolf and its design a separate fat plus if you haven t watched it yet then be sure to watch it 
Mar 19 2023,positive,a great movie that sees some of the most interesting villains match up against incredible heroes that all showcase wit humor and heart snappy dialogue and surprisingly funny moments match up alongside sharp action the new artstyle might take some getting used to but the more painterly aesthetic alongside what an intentional reduction in animation frames lends itself well to a more fairytale book feel while still giving a sense of dynamism    all in all a great movie and i cant wait to see where they go from here
Mar 19 2023,positive,awesome watch good fun and enjoyable must watch
Mar 19 2023,positive,this movie was wonderful from the animation to the creativity from this simple character to a complex and realistic lyrics characterized figure ioved the unique message and this movie was really valuable to me the themes if death make me feel seen and make this one of my favorites

Mar 17 2023,positive,honestly it was the only movie in the theatre that i deemed ageappropriate for my kids i wasnt expecting much but oh my was i pleasantly surpised this movie has heart humor charm and has a genuinly good message to both parents and kids about enjoying what life has granted you without cramming the message down your throat it is devoid of woke media messages that are so prevalent in this day in age this is one movie that will be added to my family collection already a classic in my book
Mar 17 2023,positive,what an exciting reprise to the last pass and boots movie at was funny full of action and great for adults as well as children

Mar 17 2023,positive,the absolute best movie ever must see even though it might look like a kids movie it is an amazing movie that you will enjoy no matter the age the best description of a panic attack ever seen in a movie the animation is remarkable much like spiderman into the spiderverse the story is very creative and in my opinion they made the scariest cartoon villain ever all the characters are very entertaining to watch all of the stories fit together so nicely i cant wait to see what dreamworks has in store for us if their movies are going to keep being the incredible
Mar 17 2023,positive,i love this movie it  is so good for any age group the animation score dialogue colour palettes and message is all beautiful i love everything about it please watch this
Mar 17 2023,positive,i watched it in class 1010 loved it
Mar 16 2023,positive,my 8yearold daughters review    i picked puss in boots because the pictures and the movie and the story is just beyond good and i think you should watch puss in boots  i think youll like it or even love it
Mar 16 2023,positive,a very funny colorful and well animated movie puss in boots the last wish goes surprisingly deep into its main character giving a multilayered personality and a very satisfying character development the whole cast is particularly efficient to hook you up in their adventure protagonists and antagonists all shine in their way and give you new favorites in the shrek universe   things go fast here since the main goal is to entertain puss in boots dont take too much time in event that would usually ask for a little more development its notable but not necessarily a bad thing since the characters really help to smooth things with how they command the pacing  the last wish is unexpectedly violent with literal deaths in it a few drops of bloods and one of the character is scary not a bad point actually i found it pretty great that they dared to push a little the boundaries of family entertainment
Mar 16 2023,positive,with a great script and a beautiful final message puss in boots is one of the best animations in the studio and a great movie to watch as a family
Mar 16 2023,positive,this is a beautiful movie it worked for and completely earns all of the praise it gets     it was visually fantastic it was emotionally moving they did a wonderful job telling the story even the parts i initially thought would be annoying were great it was perfectly balanced and had such good messages throughout     this movie reminds you to appreciate life and what you have to live in the moment to make the most of the time you have to not let fear control you but that it is ok to be afraid sometimes you just need to work to overcome it it supports strong family connections whether that family is biological or not the antagonistsvillains are superb  its really funny but still gives the emotional moments time to breath and this is from a sequel movie to a spinoff about a swashbuckling cat     so many movies are the equivalent of junk food and we just keep accepting it and getting more of the same    movies like this need to be praised and supported its the only way to send a message that we are tired of the constant junk thrown at us    enormous thanks to everyone involved with the creation of this gem
Mar 16 2023,positive,this movie tops the original in every way and more the animation takes a page out of spider man into the spider verse and it works the characters are fun and entertaining the messages can tackle adults and kids alike 2 of the villains in this movie are top tier dreamworks and the villain death is my favorite movie villain of all time i have no negatives or nitpicks about this movie

Mar 15 2023,positive,phenomenal i loved it
Mar 15 2023,positive,i loved this movie and its positive message of the importance of seeing things in a positive light like the character perro the little dog perro proves to everyone what an advantage it is to go through life seeing the good in everything and everyone i also loved all the references to other fairy tales and theres an excellent quote in the movie from the wizard of oz it was very entertaining with plenty of action  adventure and a little bit of a love story too i highly recommend the movie

Mar 14 2023,positive,this movie has perhaps the best villains in animated movies maybe ever the animation is stunning the humor hits well the emotional moments work and seem earned i thought perrito was going to be an annoying side character but he quickly became incredibly lovable and added to the movie the way death is handled is marvelous puss character development is good and isnt rushed and no side plots are neglected or have too much screen time fabulous movie i loved every moment
Mar 14 2023,positive,fun story that had adults laughing great animation and transitions to other types of film styles enjoyed the way the story was told selma hayek was off with her voice acting and it seemed like she didnt see what she was voicing 
Mar 13 2023,positive,with a hell of an opening punch the movie is determined to deliver action alongside a surprising amount of heart as the film toys with the fear of death and legacy much more than most animated films packed with delightful voice talent aided by the eternal chemistry between hayak and banderas
Mar 13 2023,positive,yes very very good 
Mar 13 2023,positive,a visual for the eyes the characters were charming and fun and the villains are just great it could be scary for younger kids between the ages of 25 this is one of the best and my personal favorite animated movie and possibly even movie in general of 2022 if you havent watched it yet and you have a peacock subscription or your going the theater choose this movie one of the best dreamworks movies ever made

Mar 13 2023,positive,i was really impressed how much i liked this film in the end and i am still listening the deaths theme song  the creators here did really the best with the archetypical villains and their heroes it is a real fairy tale in its own right although it is born in a series of fairy tale parodies
Mar 13 2023,positive,this movie is very good because when i see this movie i remind my friend yiğits butt and my friend kuzey who is a therapy dog
Mar 13 2023,positive,no explanation just a masterpiece it has some funny moments and emotions the villains are one of the best things in this movie as when death himself just got tired of seeing cats having nine lives and he had enough i love how it describes that a boy didnt get as much attention as a boy and he wants all of the magic in the world so he can get attention and popularity i would definitely rewatch this again with some friends and family overall this is a highly recommended movie that should be seen by everyone one of the greatest dreamworks movies ever made

Mar 12 2023,positive,from the swashbuckling action the shrekpuss franchise is known for to the witty humor directed at young and matured viewers alike puss in boots the last wish is massive breath of fresh air in both cinema and in the dreamworks line of films that left me craving more down to the mid credits scene

Mar 12 2023,positive,puss in boots the last wish is a gorgeously animated funny intelligent touching examination of the fear death growing old and not being relevant anymore while also exploring universal themes such as family friendship trust and the importance of treasuring every moment in life disneypixar can only dream about making a movie like this nowadays do yourself a favour and go watch this gem

Mar 11 2023,positive,puss in boots the last wish
Mar 11 2023,positive,we brought our almost 9yr old son and his best friend and we all loved the movie  our son was laughing so much during the movie as well as mom and dad  the visual graphics in the movie were top notch and the way they tied in childhood stories and characters into the movie plot was so cool  it was a little scary for younger kids 25yr olds as we heard some kids crying in the theater when the death character was coming to get puss  boots for his last life  over all it was one of the best kids movies and our son ranked it in his top 3 of all time  my wife ranked it as one of her favoritesmaybe her best of all time  i would agree and put it in my top three as well  because of the awesome graphics it is a movie that will be best seen in a large theater
Mar 11 2023,positive,beg for mercy from puss in boots    the concept for this film is simple puss has run out of his nine lives and can only get them back with the means of a wishing star which is in pretty high demand among the bad guys of the shrek cinematic universe the competition is goldilocks and the three bears and little jack horner who is not so little anymore along with a certain someone who is behind puss for a very specific reason    the execution of this concept is what makes this film such a treat the screenplay is straightforward and fastpaced drags somewhat in the second act but manages itself by the end the music is perfect for the aesthetic chefs kiss to be more accurate the voice acting is muy buena very good antonio banderas salma hayek florence pugh harvey guillén john mulaney wagner moura theyre all just fantastic i was genuinely invested in the characters and not solely on nostalgia not that this film does a few callbacks but those arent some cheap fanservices but something that add a little substance to the greater story    now the animation and the cinematography ughhhh its so freaking beautiful  spiderverse swung in style so puss in boots could land perfecttly on its feet there is clearly inspiration for the animation here but instead of some cheap ripoff it really feels like an artistic choice and comes off as an artists fairytale come to life here the movie literally starts with the words this is a fairytale and lives up to it the cinematography too is something to look out for this film haz better shots than i can spot in a big budget hollywood blockbuster these days dreamworks atleast never fails in that department and always manages to exceed expectations    to be honest i wasnt really expecting anything from this film because the shrek cinematic universe has been neardead for so long but this film gives me hope this film gives me something to put my faith in youd think that years of development hell would usually mean bad for a film but not for puss in boots    just go and have a good time with this and if you havent yet seen the trailer for the film dont do it just go into the film blindly like i did it will surely give you a few surprises in my opinion this is the best film in the shrek cinematic universe since shrek 2 which isnt saying a lot but it should since shrek forever after was the only good film after shrek 2    ps the new dreamworks intro is so good i just love it
Mar 11 2023,positive,i liked the movie a lot
Mar 11 2023,positive,good storyline crikey
Mar 11 2023,positive,in a time when many movies are bland retellings of old stories or a jumbled mess of little creative vision mixed with corporate algorithms puss in boots the last wish is a breath of fresh air the visual style is stunning with plenty of creative flare and eyepopping colors the beautiful animation is accompanied by timeless and heartwarming messages that anyone can connect to all i can say is we need more movies like this
Mar 11 2023,positive,these is pretty much the spider verse of dreamworks the only thing that i dislike is the piss joke like i get it its kids movie but like why  besides that movie good 
Mar 10 2023,positive,id never seen the previous puss in boots movie but as a grandad bringing his 9 year old grandson to the theater i personally found this to be a funny movie and was probably laughing a little more than my grandson  some of  the subtle cliches may have gone over his head but i found them funny
Mar 10 2023,positive,even better than the movie from 2011 i love them both i like they continued puss and kitty thread and even they added awesome backstory

Mar 10 2023,positive,when i say i am a simple person im not lying i really am easy to please with animated movies however i must give it to dreamworks this sequel really caught me off guard i was afraid that it would be a cringy empty headed movie  the visuals are fantastic the animation spectacular score catchy as hell voice acting music to the ears the casting for la muerte was really a great choice i loved the writing and the new characters that we were introduced to keep up the good work  1010 would and will watch again

Mar 8 2023,positive,one of if not the best animation i have ever seen
Mar 8 2023,positive,after rise of the guardians 2012 dreamworks movies have been so dumb and cringe they were barely managing to make an watchable movie  even though the first puss in boots was pretty good i was literally expecting nothing of this movie the trailer for puss in boots 2 show a silly plot that makes the movie seem just another bad dreamworks movie like its been in the past ten years  however i was very surprised that this movie was actually good the story though it does have some silly moments and classic dumb dreamworks humor its still pretty good and enjoyable the protagonist motivations are solid and you can feel his growth through the movie the style though it seems poorly at first is actually really beautiful and artistic  i just hope the next dreamworks movies were as good as this one  but of course after seeing the trailer for ruby gillman and trolls 3 my hopes flushed down the toilet
Mar 8 2023,positive,love this film loved the first one too loved all the characters and plot line cant wait for it to come out on dvd so i can watch it over and over again

Mar 8 2023,positive,i went to see this because my friend said she saw a teenager on tiktok say it low key slaps and after my experience with this movie i concur i may even say it highkey slaps i loved the colorful and inventive sets especially once they enter the dark woods and the map changes their obstacles  an excellent story device and visually delightful we all loved it when the cats broke character and acted like cats i also became incredibly invested in the goldilocksbears family drama 1010
Mar 8 2023,positive,whats not to like youve seen all the other reviews im sure the only people that dont like it are the folks that dont respect animation in general and some distraught parents that think a single drop of blood is unacceptable this movie is as close to a masterpiece as a family film can be tackling subjects like mortality and found family guaranteed youll like it

Mar 6 2023,positive,better thought through plot and more character development than the last six marvel films put together beautiful to look at too with an individual style which is a mix of painted illustration mixed with manga  this is also refreshing as most animated films all seem to look the same
Mar 6 2023,positive,great storytelling reminds me of something from before 2015 timeless themes and no exhausted progressive political messaging well done to both writers for not caving in to ideologies and just focusing on a good story hopefully more to come   im gonna watch it againi loved it very refreshing

Mar 6 2023,positive,puss in boots the last wish is the greatest movie of all time it saved my firstborn cured my illnesses cured my depression stopped climate change saved animation as a medium killed donald trump and solved world hunger in conclusion the wolf should step on me
Mar 6 2023,positive,its great one of the better movies lately the characters are great and relatable in various ways not as flat as expected from animated movie love that studio started experimenting with animation styles and its not just another standartised 3d jig looking at you pixar and your recent years of work thats becoming increasingly muddied stylistically   im not sure whether puss in boots is going to have another story but im pleasantly surprised about where dreamworks could go after seeing puss in boots
Mar 6 2023,positive,time to wake up disney dreamworks has long been eating your lunch and puss just finished your dessert i cannot praise this movie enough its a visual feast hilarious in places and sombre and honest where it counts and they let the hardhitting moments linger none of this wisecracking a joke right away that the mcu does just in case the audience stops laughing for 3 seconds    the last wish is a breath of fresh air it doesnt harp on at the audience it doesnt lecture and it doesnt reiterate the typical environment good white men bad rhetoric that disney has been repeating since they turned awful puss carries a genuinely essential and universal message about making the most of your life overcoming hardships and bad luck and coming out all the stronger for it with an appreciation for what you have it may be hard for modern audiences to relate to putting others needs before your own instant selfish gratification but its nice that thats also a theme    its fantastic and i would love to see more studios returning to a more wholesome and honest approach to making movies enough woke bs
Mar 6 2023,positive,wonderful storytelling and the pacing was all right this continues the amazing shrek quality of humor and weaving of childhood tales ideas its a must see for anyone whos ever enjoyed any shrek movies i look forward to more

Mar 5 2023,positive,this movie is epic and yes i admit that im terrified of the wolf hes terrifying hes cool but terrifying
Mar 5 2023,positive,i absolutely loved that movie
Mar 5 2023,positive,this movie made me call my dad i never met thats how good the film was the shrek universe makes the impossible possible definitely recommend watching this  giving your dad a call

Mar 5 2023,positive,great movie from beginning to end
Mar 5 2023,positive,it was entertaining
Mar 5 2023,positive,i watched the movie for the first time a little under two months ago and can i just say i was in awe i was in florida visiting my grandparents for vacation and it was one of the first things i wanted to do with my grandma while there i had heard a lot of praise for the movie from my friends age range 1420 and since im an enjoyer of animation in the first place i went to go see it now i will say i went into this with little background of how the first movie went  i had watched it once and that was several years prior good thing about the last wish though  you dont need too much background information so to an extent it can work as a standalone movie if you really want it to be going into the actual movie wow the animation was absolutely stunning they definitely took a lot of inspiration from into the spiderverse regarding the animation mixing the 2d and 3d together ive seen several reviews saying that made it hard to watch or look cheap but it was quite the opposite quite dynamic it was also very colorful and very detailed but not too much so  just right as goldilocks would say speaking of goldilocks regarding the characters i think they were also very well done its easy to root for puss hes not one of those protagonists that you get bored and annoyed with especially with kitty and perrito supporting him in his leading role the villains of the movie were also very well done death the wolf was quite ominous and accurately embodied death straight up goldilocks was a flawed character rather than an actual evil one and it was nice that her story and wish was resolved at the end in a sweet way though i will say if i have any critiques at all you could see that from a mile away jack horner though being the most unapologetically evil character is also one of the funniest and most memorable of all killer design funny lines john mulaney did such a great job voicing him in fact all of the voice actors and actresses were flawless  they fit their characters and fit the tones perfectly   a lot of reviews against this movie say its too dark but i think thats what makes this movie so beautiful yes one of the main topics is mortality and if thats not something you are ready to talk about with your child  assuming thats who youre going to bring to the movie  then do not bring them however if you want them to be able to discuss and see the topic of mortality in a healthy safe way this is definitely the movie for you a lot of media these days struggles in how to discuss death i think the last wish definitely illustrates how ominous and scary the topic of death may be with its personification of death the wolf character at the same time puss is able to tackle his fear of death in the end   all things considered this movie absolutely knocked it out of the park there is so much to enjoy out of this movie from humor fun characters sweet moments dynamic fight scenes which do not take up the whole movie by the way absolutely gorgeous animation and a killer soundtrack that doesnt get enough creditand of course the fact that there is a lot to think about after watching it   i highly recommend this movie treat yourself andor your loved ones and go watch it
Mar 5 2023,positive,terrific story and finally a movie with a positive message about family and perpective in life

Mar 5 2023,positive,nice movie for kids
Mar 4 2023,positive,lots of adventures for puss animation was unreal
Mar 4 2023,positive,the animation is outstanding and is on par with that of spiderman into the spiderverse puss in boots is a very compelling protagonist who goes through a very well written character arc where he comes to term with his mortality the side characters are very entertaining and give the audience some strong emotional scenes as well as lots of laughs deaths character design was beautiful and he is one of the coolest animated villains ever jack horner was hilarious the way he disregards human life and is irredeemably evil is so refreshing and something i havent seen a lot of since old disney dreamworks really put their heart and soul into this film and made it one of the best animated movies in recent memory would recommend and is definitely worth your time go see it if you havent already
Mar 4 2023,positive,i liked that the story heartened back to the original fairy tales as did shrek  it was sweet

Mar 4 2023,positive,golly i wanna watch this over and over put your money into this we need more movies like this the comedy was just like the first shrek moviepefect the conflict was my favorite out of any shrek universe movie villains were just as if not better than the kung fu panda onesmainly death the side characters like the ethical bug were great i miss this profanity i miss puss i miss these references to fairy tales and the teaser spoiler    at the end where they return to far far away was making me wanna scream in happiness i just cant wait for the future of dreamworks though   i like shrek just a little bit more this the overall better movie 1010 watch it now

Mar 3 2023,positive,this movie had no right to be as good as it was first i want to start by talking about the villain holy shit that was awesome to see the menacing figure that you could believe would actually make the fearless puss in boots quiver the animation worked well in the kind of spiderman into the spiderverse type of way where the frames drop and it looks great here as well i thought the movie was pretty imaginative and the side characters were likable the morals while not super deep were well done and properly conveyed this movie shows that dreamworks can still release bangers
Mar 3 2023,positive,fantastic all around villains especially were toptier and tons of humor that adults could enjoy while the kid stuff wasnt cringe

Mar 2 2023,positive,great i go as far as to say best animated movie ever though that may changethe animation style is very good the paintbrush style mixed with the framerates dropping when there is action makes it a very good movie the general story is also great it follows a character who is dealing with the fear of death both figuratively and literally so please watch this movie it is so good

Mar 1 2023,positive,puss in boots the last wish is the movie of the year not only is it a visually stunning movie but it is a masterfully told story it is heavily stylized reminiscent of  storybook illustrations and comicbook action scenes the story is incredibly focused and welltold with strong charaterization for all of the characters there isnt a single unlikeable character the consistency in tone and plot theme definitely makes this a winner highly recommend and definitely worth revisiting again and again 55  will watch again

Feb 28 2023,positive,such a good heart tugging movie
Feb 28 2023,positive,a sequel to an average spinoff film that struggles to make its own name somehow has a sequel more than a decade later that excels at everything cinema is missing these days great storytelling great villains excellent character journeys and a kids film that has more profound and more mature themes that even 12a and 15 films lack while i admit the wolf may be slightly too scary for the age range it appeals to in its more vibrant childlike audience i think it fits into a wider family film that has its laughs for the kids while not being afraid to make an emotional effect on the grownups kids and grownups love this film alike just what a family film should do family films are now more kids films that grownups watch out of necessity but puss in boots the last wish is hopefully the start of animation going back to being a family occasion and not just a kidsonly appeal dreamworks could be onto the renaissance of animation and if the same team is working on shrek 5 i am definitely on board
Feb 28 2023,positive,amazing i really really really enjoyed it great animationart style story characters side characters soundtrack cast villains relationships u name it everything about it was so good def one of my fave movies a must watch for ppl who love dreamworks and adventure watching it on the big screen was amazing and i highly recommend watching it cause u wont be disappointed

Feb 28 2023,positive,this is the first time where i have seen the audience scores aligned with the critic scores normally i would say critic scores are trying to be cooperatefriendly and be as nice as possible to the moviethe exact opposite of what a critic is ironically but i have to say the critic and audience score is very justified i may or may not update this post because i have only seen this movie once    so right now i am going to be upfront and write my critiques out of the way so i can talk about the good stuff after    so i dont know if its the effects of my sensory issues and loud movie theater speakers clashing but it induced a bit of anxiety in me it couldve just be the first few minutes kind of rushing through along with other effects or it was just loud speakers and my sensitive ears colliding i really dont know i would have to rewatch so other time to see the first few minutes are kind of just a fuzzy memory to me    i also dont know why they didnt just address the problem between puss and softpaws earlier in the movie there isnt necessarily anything bad about it but i feel it wouldve been better addressed earlier    thats really my only concerns not even a problem really    i think that all the villians are all pretty solid for there being multiple villains you know what scratch that they arent just solid villains they are all really good villains plain an simple     jack horner isnt trying to be relatable at all he doesnt have some sad back story that tries to get you to sympathize with him he is just pure evil he believes only he should be entitled to his power doesnt give a damn about anyone else and would do anything to get what he want even if it means needlessly putting others lives at risk even those who dedicate there services to him it is a bit more refreshing to see that we arent being guilt tripped through a story and we are being shown that evil isnt made because of bad things it can just be made in anyone regardless plain and simple     he also isnt 2 dimensional either he might not have a conscious telling him what right and wrong is but you are shown he has a reason for doing it even if you dont understand his ideologies or reasonings it is showcased in ways that you understand what he is doing and why he knows that once he gets his hands on the power no one will be able to stop him anyway and he is confident he can get it    ohhh and death death is just amazing to watch on screen he literally gave me the chills anytime he was on screen and i love it thats how you right a villain when his presence on screen is so intense that you get chills just seeing him he is just a badass through and through nothing else and i dont mean it metaphorically or rhetorically or poetically or theoretically or any other fancy way he is a total badass straight up    he has so many memorable quotes i just cant help but reference them as i am writing this review he is genuinely that fun and memorable as a villain     he also has a motive that isnt just clear like jack horners but you understand why and you dont just understand why his motives are almost justified you almost root for him at times    not to mention puss in boots arc where he goes from arrogant ass who doesnt truly value his lives until he realizes he doesnt have any to lose to one who would like to spend his life wisely and happily realizing what life is    everyone going after the wish has a reason to go after the wish and then they realize they had what they wished for and its just so good it shows that you could learn to look at what you have and not take it for granted    i could go on for hours and hours why this movie was such a good movie but i bet you probably came here for a shorter review just to see if this movie you didnt come for a whole essay so i am going to cut it short here and save everyone including myself time this movie is going to be one of the highest ratings i may ever give to a movie its that good watch it as soon as possible
Feb 28 2023,positive,the new sequel to the puss in boots franchise is definitely one one of the best dreamworks movie that i have seen since kung fu panda 3 the animation was a fresh look over what dreamworks typically does the characters were relatable while keeping themselves unique towards the movie the movie is certainly a must see kind of movie suitable for all ages
Feb 27 2023,positive,dreamworks is clearly saying with this movie that they are now king of the hill in animation films the animation is incredible and the cast of characters is great the one thing that sticks out though is the character death in my opinion one of the scariest villains in animation history he defies in any scene giving you goosebumps along with an incredibly intimidating voice given by the talented wagner moura if this is the new standard of what dreamworks is going to make i can confidentially say for everyone we are excited and hope for the best but please no more trolls or boss baby
Feb 27 2023,positive,the animated film is fantastic in every way and i dont mean it metaphorically or rhetorically or poetically or theoretically or in any other fancy way straight up great movie
Feb 27 2023,negative,pg i was absolutely shocked at the fat shaming what the hell usage name calling extremely rude gestures and bullying from the baker this movie is not appropriate for anyone under the age of 12 my 6 year old was absolutely terrified of the wolf of death which im also blown away that we are trying to covey such emotional traumatizing messages to children the movie is pretty enjoyable for an adult hardly even close to appropriate for a child i hope they can rerate it pg13
Feb 27 2023,positive,the perfect movieforeverrrrr

Feb 26 2023,neutral,so this doesnt rise to the same quality as the first 2 shrek movies for me it was enjoyable but i didnt walk out of the theater blown over
Feb 26 2023,positive,an absolute home run masterpiece i heard the good reviews and had some high expectations and i was still impressed the visuals the plot the characters was worth every penny seeing it in the theatre
Feb 26 2023,positive,refreshing with great dialogues animation and even though i am an adult  i loved watching this plus the dog steals the show
Feb 26 2023,positive,some really powerful messages in this film covering for example the inability to cheat death experiencing fear and fear of death love and betrayal trust and loss of it recognising and appreciating what we already have rather than wishing for things the power of forgiveness the pitfalls of ego and more besides some of the action scenes especially towards the end were rather repetitive and seemed to hold back the progress of the story towards its conclusion scratch below the surface of the wonderful animation and character portrayal and there are some profound doctrines of truth to be found
Feb 26 2023,positive,the best animated movie ive seen in a long time 
Feb 26 2023,positive,honestly this is one of the best movies i have seen in 2022 it has amazing and unique visuals like spider man into the spiderverse it has a phenominal and mature story about growing up and knowing you can only live life once so live it to the fullest seriously this movie is on par with some of pixars greatest films highly highly recommend this sequel to puss in boots and cant wait to see what the future of the shrek franchise gives

Feb 26 2023,positive,the best animated movie out there it has such a good artwork plot everything is just amazing
Feb 26 2023,positive,wonderful things happen when dreamworks is on top of their game puss in boots the last wish takes what made the character enticing to begin with and elevates him while also giving him a worthwhile journey full of emotion fear and comedy the rest of the movie around puss is equally entertaining salma hayek is the perfect match for kitty softpaws who herself is elevated and doesnt feel forced john mulaney as big jack horner may not be the top villain of the film but provides a loose and silly portrayal oh and whos the best villain in the film discover it for yourself but its worth watching just for that ill just say its a thing of beauty
Feb 26 2023,positive,movie was pretty good dreamworks main antagonist in this movie was very good the villain was lethal and had that fire in him definitely cannot wait to see the next puss in boots movie

Feb 25 2023,positive,i loved how well it handled such adult themes such as death and family the first 20 minutes or so was a bit iffy and made me wonder if i was going to enjoy it and the many musical numbers were a bit annoying but the story the animation and voice acting were all amazing interested to see where it goes from here

Feb 24 2023,positive,one of dreamworks best movies and honestly one of my favorite animated films of all time the last wish is just amazing all around and im really happy now that more stylized animation is being used by other studios in a really cool way this movie was one of the last movies that i thought was going to be really good but im very happy that it went above and beyond what i thought it was going to be the story is pretty cliche and generic yes but its everything around the story that makes this film so good the animation is incredibly the spiderverse style works very well for this film and it still stands out from spiderverse in its own unique way the characters and their own respective arcs are great there really isnt one weak character here puss himself gets some excellent development and his journey of grabbing with the concept of death is very emotional and well written kitty softpaws also has a really good arc and chemistry with puss and perrito has some really great moments all of the villains here are great goldilocks and the 3 bears all have a good arc and jack horner is one of the funniest characters ever included in an animated film and works amazingly well as the irredeemable villain but the real standout here is death death is probably one of if not the best dreamworks villain to have death be personified and built up the way it is in the film is just something else his interactions with puss were always amazing the humor was great as well pretty much every joke from jack landed and all the other jokes were really great as well everyone involved with this film felt like they really cared about the characters and the story and thats what makes the film so great i would highly recommend checking this film out as its genuinely one of the best films of 2022 and one of the best animated movies ever
Feb 24 2023,positive,one of dreamworks best movies and honestly one of my favorite animated films of all time the last wish is just amazing all around and im really happy now that more stylized animation is being used by other studios in a really cool way this movie was one of the last movies that i thought was going to be really good but im very happy that it went above and beyond what i thought it was going to be the story is pretty cliche and generic yes but its everything around the story that makes this film so good the animation is incredibly the spiderverse style works very well for this film and it still stands out from spiderverse in its own unique way the characters and their own respective arcs are great there really isnt one weak character here puss himself gets some excellent development and his journey of grabbing with the concept of death is very emotional and well written kitty softpaws also has a really good arc and chemistry with puss and perrito has some really great moments all of the villains here are great goldilocks and the 3 bears all have a good arc and jack horner is one of the funniest characters ever included in an animated film and works amazingly well as the irredeemable villain but the real standout here is death death is probably one of if not the best dreamworks villain to have death be personified and built up the way it is in the film is just something else his interactions with puss were always amazing the humor was great as well pretty much every joke from jack landed and all the other jokes were really great as well everyone involved with this film felt like they really cared about the characters and the story and thats what makes the film so great i would highly recommend checking this film out as its genuinely one of the best films of 2022 and one of the best animated movies ever

Feb 24 2023,positive,puss in boots the last wish absolutely took my breath away this work of art provides everything you could ask for in an animated film the animation was superb with a slight action style that added a unique spark to the already beautiful visuals which had such a variety of themes plus the character design im still getting over how amazing the wolf looked absolutely horrifying but so fun to watch the direction was one of the best ive seen in any animated movie with stunning shots that im shocked other films havent used the worldbuilding was so compelling with elements of fantasy and adventure so interesting and thoughtprovoking and ideas so brilliant ive truly never seen anything like it the voice acting was perfect casting celebrities that are actually good at voice acting and actors ive never seen before that still were great the characters were set up so well with emotional sequences and character building that was heartfelt and realistic despite the movie being about talking animals and fictional creatures the comedy was wonderful with disney parodies and fairy tale references plus sequences that were extremely funny theres practically nothing wrong with this movie everything was so riveting and fun to watch always entertaining you while keeping you in suspense overall this is one of the best movies ive ever seen animated or not i was invested throughout the entire experience rooting for characters in their toughest moments and genuinely tearing up multiple times this movie is outstanding
Feb 24 2023,positive,he was arrogant selfish prideful he was the legend but now he is truly a legend because he humbled himself he found someone other than himself to put first she saved his life with a gift he redeemed himself and now lives his life with value i think us adults along with the kids need a movie like this to think about how were living our life and it sure stomped on my toe this is an amazing movie with an amazing cast story and animation 910 for me and if you disagree thats completely fine but this is my opinion and youre free to have your own by far my favorite animated movie through my lifetime so far highly recommend and oh my goodness their relationship truly brought me to tears and i loved every second they were on screen together

Feb 22 2023,positive,puss in boots a loved character across the shrek universe this was an amazing sequel and an absolute must see all the characters were amazing with a perfect story line but i must say death one of the greatest villains of all time when watching him he sent cold shivers down my spine dreamworks hit hard with him and it was an amazing choice to do so           so im conclusion i think this movie was amazing and had to be the best dreamworks movie the creators did well in everything and it came with a great outcome in my opinion i think everyone needs to see this action packed masterpiece im a dog person but this was so good that it made me like puss in boots and other cats a lot lot more i thank the creators for making the global phenomenon puss in boots the last wish

Feb 22 2023,positive,one of the best movies to come out in 2022 the plot was amazing and even the sub plots from side characters were outstanding death in this movie played a very chilling role one of the most fleshed out animated villains created its good fun for kids and adults very funny moments in this film salma hayek did amazing as kitty softpaws  didnt even realize she voiced her by how well she did the chemistry between her and antonio banderas is almost perfect rating 1010

Feb 21 2023,positive,best movie ive seen in years not just the animated genre
Feb 21 2023,positive,this is absolutely one of the greatest movies ive ever seen ive seen it twice now and i just cant stop thinking about it i always thought that if dreamworks were to ever return to shrek and its universe it would be some terrible cash grab like shrek the third but puss in boots the last wish has confirmed that dreamworks still has the ability to make masterpieces of storytelling  i highly recommend going in as spoiler free as possible this is a must see for anyone and definitely deserves the price of admission dont pirate it seriously dreamworks deserves to reap the benefits of creating masterpieces like this
Feb 21 2023,positive,hey you wanna see something cool then go watch this movie
Feb 21 2023,positive,puss in boots was one of the most stunningly creative and beautiful animated movies i have watched you can tell that it was created with love and passion not to mention the story itself is wholesome and fun
Feb 21 2023,positive,honestly with the use of so many characters the movie should have felt cramped however the way the characters were designed so that they were easily sewn into the story worked no character felt like they had too much or too little time on the screen every characters amount of time on screen was just right    great for all ages funny and well written
Feb 21 2023,positive,my first cinema experience of 2023 and what a good one it was i didnt have high expectations  i decided on a whim to see it after two recommendations in separate unrelated youtube videos i didnt even remember this is a sequel nevertheless it was fantastic and a fantastic standalone film the animation style is delightful and similar in many ways to into the spiderverse with an overall painterly comic book aesthetic and creative use of variable frame rate and colour the story brilliantly balances real heart with cracking jokes the characters are all super endearing and energetically acted  suave puss and his old flame kitty effervescent perrito relentlessly comedically cruel jack horner surprisingly familial goldi and her three bears and the spectre following puss everywhere the story is interesting taking someone who has grown to think himself untouchable and challenging him to stop thinking about himself for once and along the way a loner learns to trust again a dog with the saddest backstory finds a loving family and an adopted child comes to appreciate her found family so much else to love  the shrek cameos the touching portrayal of a panic attack the inuniverse theme song he is your favourite fearless hero the touches of anime in fight choreography i cant wait to see it again
Feb 21 2023,positive,my 11  16 yr old wanted to see this so i grudgingly went along much to my surprise i actually enjoyed it only odd thing was the merge of different types of animation for action scenes it was an interesting idea but didnt work very well and looked weird otherwise good story good animation better than shrek
Feb 21 2023,positive,this was a 1010 solid movie its a mustsee if you are a fan of the shrek universe
Feb 21 2023,positive,heartfelt promotes normal family values refreshing
Feb 21 2023,positive,this was the greatest film ive ever seen i watched it multiple times over i never thought i would feel my heartbeat during a spanish cat movie
Feb 21 2023,positive,the movie provided a lot of laughs my 8 and 6 yr old children loved the movie
Feb 21 2023,positive,i didnt suppose that puss in boots the last wish would be so good starting with the plot  its exciting and engaging even for an older audience its a cute story about friendship presented humorously the characters are wellwritten and the plot is gripping the graphic style of the movie is intriguing as it sometimes mixes realistic 3d characters with pastel handdrawn landscapes it looks excellent i highly recommend watching puss in boots the last wish on a big screen its definitely worth it one of the biggest surprises of the year for sure
Feb 21 2023,positive,ok fairy tale the villains were quite well made the allies not so much  the laggy style of fight animations made them very unpleasing to watch
Feb 21 2023,positive,i adore this movie this is my third time watching it in theaters and i enjoyed it just as much as the first the best movie in the shrek franchise
Feb 21 2023,positive,absolutely amazing most beautiful great godly film ever honestly its probably my favorite movie the animation the characters the plot all of it is great spoilers   the wolf death is one of the best villains ive ever seen jack horner was hilarious and enjoyable as a villain perrito god perrito was great too i just this thing is too good please watch this if you havent please
Feb 21 2023,positive,this movie is great the animation is insane along with the fighting scenes
Feb 21 2023,positive,amazing movie and the seats were great wings could be a little better but its a movie theater so im not really complaining the surround sound along with the bass was amazing as well wolf was so well written as well as the message

Feb 21 2023,positive,puss in boots the last wish understands its audience to a fault and delivers a film that exceeds expectations with its colourful animation heartwrenching storytelling and mature tone this film proves that allages entertainment can be so much more than dull
Feb 21 2023,positive,this is the absolute biggest surprise for a movie the visuals are really cool the voice acting is really well done and the writing is spot on the best part is one of the villains is probably the best villain to come along in a long time  wow what a surprise go see this
Feb 21 2023,positive,the last wish might very well be dreamworks magnum opus at bare minimum its one of their best by far i have seen very few films that have successfully nailed such a strong balance of comedy action poignant moments and  surprisingly  legitimate horror that tlw manages to pull this off while being a mostlychildfriendly animated film is deserving of praise while it doesnt quite reach perfection it comes remarkably close a mustsee for anyone with even a passing interest in animated films
Feb 21 2023,positive,in my entire life i have never gone out of my way to rate any movie yet watching thiswas just a pure pleasure never before did i enjoy watching something as i had with puss in boots the last wish im always an active critic yelling in my mind on why the movie is terrible and unrealistic while im watching it yet i didnt do that at all while watching this     the story plot line is perfect it is somewhat bit more fast paced but there is 0 filler or unnecessary moments each and every part seems to contribute to a lesson or meaning and really builds each of the characters that we see in the short amount of time less than 2 hours the buildup is solid and the ending is amazing    the voice acting is flat down some of the best ive ever heard for any animated movie fantastic and describes each character exactly i actually never noticed this about any other movies but it really stood out to me from this one     overall the movie is a 1010 from a solid critics viewpoint
Feb 21 2023,positive,the wolf hunter is one of the cooler caracaters ive seen in a movie for a while puss in boots fearing him its something really cool when the whistles begins the plot of the wolf its amazing good movie

Feb 19 2023,positive,puss in boots the last wish is a masterpiece the movie was over 10 years in the making and it shows not a single part of it feels rushed forced or poorly done it has gotten stellar reviews on all fronts because the movie is flawless in every regard its no wonder that a fantastically executed depiction of one of the most consistently beloved characters in history makes for the greatest movie of all time  the movie utilizes an animation style inspired by spiderman into the spiderverse a movie similarly praised by critics nigh on universally for its fantastic art dreamworks used this same system in the production of puss in boots another example of why the decadelong wait after its original announcement contributed to how truly spectacular the movie is the paintinglike style of art created an atmosphere that felt very much like a fairytale as opposed to the justoffreality vibe that cgi movies of the past had or the totally devoid of realism style of completely handdrawn movies such as aladdin or the lion king dreamworks gave us the best that there is in the animated world by refusing to hold back on the art style the fact that all movies with higher acclaim amongst critics happen to be live action only serves to illustrate why this movie isnt considered better by so called professionals  this artstyle helps contribute to the simply stunning fight scenes in puss in boots the last wish however the visuals are not the only thing that makes the swordsmanship in this movie stand out unlike other movies using swords the last wish holds a great degree of accuracy to real life swordsmanship in every single fight it is clear who is attacking who who is on offense who is on defense puss can be seen parrying and then counter attacking with a well executed riposte just like in real fencing puss fight with death at the end of the movie is the most spectacular fight throughout with both characters showing off the true height of their ability utilizing their respective advantages in speed dexterity strength size cunning and more and not just pointlessly slapping sticks together between them whats more puss use of a socalled gatito blade in his offhand is highly consistent with the use of parrying daggers which were quite popular in italy and spain for use in rapier fencing such historical accuracy is quite rare in tv shows and movies and for it to be found in a childrens movie where that is rarely a concern just goes to show how much effort was put into the movie finer details such as these serve to show just how great of flawless masterpiece this movie really is whats more every fight in the movie serves a purpose other than just violence for the sake of violence they help create exposition advance the plot and develop characters whether that be by showing big jack horners ruthlessness the strengthening of three bears familial bonds or galvanizing puss to be brave and value his lives and the time he has with his friends  the message of the story is found in the final fight scene without having to be explicitly said the message is still clear you should cherish every second the movie also has much to say about how its ok to be afraid a lesson many young boys and all men really need to hear it has a flawless and nuanced depiction of a panic attack something that cant be said for most movies and shows us that we dont always have as much control as we thought we did and thats ok therein lies the elegance of puss in boots the last wish it is at its heart a childrens movie and therefore has the obligation to leave the audience with a clear and positive message this is no easy task for a movie to accomplish without being heavy handed luckily for the last wish the movie is far from heavy handed with every message in the story being flawlessly woven into the very essence of the movie instead of being carelessly stapled on top like so many other movies do the reward of being appropriate for all audiences and for leaving them all with a positive message is incalculable and one of the many reasons puss in boots the last wish is greater than any other movie despite their higher approval amongst critics  puss in boots the last wish is a work of art it is not only accessible to all audiences but entertaining to them as well it surrounds a beloved character that is a knownquantity in his beloved status amongst all and does him justice in innumerable ways the movies attention to detail and sheer visual beauty set it apart from any other animated movie ever made while its character development positive messages and ability to stay within a pg rating puts it far ahead the dark live action movies that dominate the highest rated spots amongst movie review websites dreamworks didnt hold back on this one and on god it shows
Feb 19 2023,positive,the kids said they disliked the fact that they were almost swearing in a couple of the scenes but they both really liked the puppy character
Feb 19 2023,positive,animation like spiderman univers great and funny old fasion dreamworks story and finaly great film that we need
Feb 19 2023,positive,hey disney are you watching this is how you make an animated movie not box checking or trying to shoe horn in a message nobody needs to know good characters and a fun story thats all we need great movie i enjoyed it from start to finish and its been a while since an animated movie did that
Feb 19 2023,positive,when i first watched this movie i was shocked at the amazing animation style that dreamworks did in this film took insperation from into the spiderverse and made it 10x better i highly recommend everyone to watch this movie
Feb 19 2023,positive,my god this was amazing my little cousins laughing and i almost cried in some scenes show the big contrast that age have on how you see life depending the stage of life     that scene between perrito and puss many people including me were sobbing what a great message and the villains show an stoppable force an incomprehensible and unknown gift and the punishment for a selfish wish     the animations is on point the plot is well developed and the fact that this gave us a hint on what is coming this is absolutely amazing and oscars deserving
Feb 19 2023,negative,this movie answers the question why are children so cruel afraid and violent no plot terrible morals gratuitous fear queerphobia sizeism i left half way through 1 star
Feb 19 2023,positive,right up with shrek 2
Feb 19 2023,positive,the first film was a unsuccessful shrek spin off  dreamworks trying  to make the shrek universe survive without shrek but this redefines puss in bootss character with accurate depictions of panic attacks and anxiety and packages all of that with beautiful stylised  animation and uses techniques such as slowing the frame rate of fight scene to create quick and rapid animation in the action scenes as well as adding a few bleeped sequences which dosent alienate the film from kids but means the adults with the kids can enjoy the film so in conclusion just watch this film theres no reason not to unless you have some outlandish stereotype about animation and how its for kids
Feb 19 2023,positive,this movie is amazing it was revolutionary a good and heart sequel  characters with captivating stories extremely good villains excellent story and animation one of the best films from dreamworks and the animated film industry that i have seen i highly recommend it
Feb 19 2023,positive,ive made an account just to tell you how great this movie is honestly this is the best animated movie ive ever watched everything about this movie was great
Feb 19 2023,positive,the definition of how a franchise matures with its audience
Feb 19 2023,positive,just as everyone expected a sequel to a spinoff to the shrek franchise that took 11 years to arrive in theatres was the animated movie that took the world by storm     the last wish really did defy expectations assuming people had any the animation style was refreshing for the franchise the humor was more balanced with the characterdriven story and despite maintaining three different villains the film feels solid rather than clunky instead of frequent pop culture references and dodgy jokes that pad for time in the later shrek films this puss in boots sequel weaves the influences of classic spaghetti westerns and swashbuckler films with a family adventure storyline and affirmative positive themes about appreciating life and those around you it knows when to be lighthearted and when to be serious and introduces us to one of the coolest original villains in family animation  a wolf embodiment of death  by not holding back on the menacing aura and instead focusing on it hopefully the sense of danger will encourage other franchises to stop oversanitizing their films if i were in the movies target audience it would probably be a film i would swear by for the rest of my life sort of like shrek 2 but in this case ill just call it a very good family movie that came out of nowhere    i hope youre all ready for more shrek because now its basically guaranteed to happen and they will likely be disappointing 355
Feb 19 2023,positive,man i have nothing to say this movie is incredibly wonderful i loved its animation style the voice acting the villains the soundtrack and the action scenes cute and deep and i thought it was amazing

Feb 17 2023,positive,an absolute treat to watch on the big screen mind blowing cgi  the sequel is way better than the previous one death the big bad wolf was one of the most scariest villians ever made by dreamworks absolute must watch
Feb 17 2023,positive,once the film finished and the lights turned on i turned to my partner and said this had no right to be this good     5 stars
Feb 17 2023,positive,a fantastic movie the animation is superb mimicking some of the animation style of spiderman into the spider verse it is beautiful visually and as a story in whole it departs from visual style of the 1st and shrek style with a deep story about life much more than i expected from this movie i was not anticipating feeling some of emotions i did going into this movie i would highly recommend what it takes from in humor from the first movie it has double the heart and depth
Feb 17 2023,positive,as a cartoon movie lover i have watched the movie called puss in boots the last wish i have watched the last puss in boots movie in 2011 it seems like it brings back our childhood memories due to the technology the animation is better than the last movie 10 years ago puss in boots is a cat with boots a brave hero with nine lives the movie starts with a fighting scene and he lost the eighth life in the opening battle and he only has one life he started to be afraid to die and he wanted to find the wishing star that can give him back his nine lives    on his journey finding the last wishing star there are a lot of adventures awaiting and he meet unexpected characters the one is his lover and the other is a dog he named him pero or perito which means dog in spanish his life story shocks to the audience but he has positive thinking about everything he faced in his life apart from puss in boots there are villains who are trying to find the wishing star there is also a villain is the big bad wolf named death who is trying to take puss in boots39s life instead of trying to find the wishing star if you watch the whole movie you will know death is not a villain the fighting scene between death and puss in boots is epic every time death appears it makes my bone chill his style and background music are so artistic    it is interesting that who got the wishing star and you will find out because it is unexpected plot twist overall this movie is really good and more than a just fun cartoon movie that a family gather and watch the animation style and the story line of the movie are great and i want to say puss in boots is coming back with great success

Feb 16 2023,positive,honestly i was so impressed with the movie i took my ten year old daughter to see it and we both really loved it it was filled with clever lines and fun scenes but also really heartwarming moments about friendship and family the animation was really well done but the style during action scenes changed to being similar to into the spiderverse which i thought was strange at first but still looked good the voice acting and characters were all well written and all had their own character development which was meaningful definitely watch this movie as its really great

Feb 16 2023,positive,one of the best movie seen after a long time must see puss in boots is absolutely magnificent story animation cast direction is top notch would recommend everyone to watch this movie
Feb 16 2023,positive,puss in boots the last wish made me sign up to this platform to give a review thats how good it was     the films animation and art style is amazing blending stylized 3d visuals with beautiful 2d animation and effects to create a visually appealing movie on the lines of spiderman into the spiderverse    then we get the story a story that deals with the themes of life and death so maturely that you forget this is supposed to be a familyfriendly childrens movie and thats because its a movie for everyone whos protagonist just happens to be your favourite fearless hero puss in boots   i havent seen a film deal with this theme so maturely in so long the acceptance of ones own mortality being a reason to find things worth fighting for in your one life   pib might be the best interpretation and dealing with said theme i have ever seen     and at the heart of it all is a film that doesnt take your time for granted being around 100 minutes long short for this current age of cinema keeps the pace going whilst allowing for those slow moments to make you feel puss every thought and feeling on his latest adventure     and plenty of fun and entertainment to be had     no matter how old you are you need to go see this movie
Feb 16 2023,positive,my expectations were pretty low but during the vision i immediately realized how good of a movie this is   a delight for the eyes and for the soul  must see

Feb 16 2023,positive,the greatest animated film in awhile the existentialism that puss portrayed in this film really broadens the theme and brings it all together in the end i would not walk but run to the theater to see this film     10010 strongly recommend
Feb 16 2023,positive,cute movie i didnt expect it to be so deep lol i would recommend
Feb 16 2023,positive,initially you walk in thinking this movie is just for kids this movie wont be anything but another kids movie but then after a glorious one hour and forty minutes of amazing voice acting followed by outstanding animation youve realized you just witnessed the greatest piece of the film created within the last century not only were the protagonists of the story amazing in all their regards but the antagonist added way more than expected making this film such an outstanding piece of cinema
Feb 16 2023,positive,puss in boots the last wish is a very enjoyable animated film that has one of the most iconic animated characters puss in boots i really enjoyed the new animation style they used for this film the story is also really engaging to the viewer with puss and boots on the last of his nine lives and the new villain that is introduced in this film death death is one of the darker villains ive ever seen in a kid targeted animated film but there is many factors in the film from silly humor and silly characters that even out the tone of the movie overall i really recommend this film or just to the younger audiences but to everyone who enjoys watching animated films    eric bautista 
Feb 16 2023,positive,best 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life
Feb 16 2023,positive,nearly perfect the only thing id have be different is the british characters oh my god americans cant write english people to save their life also how they kinda ruined the ending by spelling out the message of the movie and just screwing over the sweet subtlety the rest of the movie set up

Feb 14 2023,positive,biggest surprise of 2022 fantastic animation and a great story with good morals well written characters and a great soundtrack this movie is hilarious and is fun for the whole family
Feb 14 2023,positive,this movie perfectly exemplifies the social construct we know as death in the film puss is chased day after day by the reaper of death but in the end he simply says no leaving death only to ponder pursuing puss in the first place its moments like these in film where we are reminded of the game we play puss like all of us has something inside him that he loves and doesnt want to go away we thank you puss thanks for letting us spend a day in your boots

Feb 13 2023,positive,dreamworks definitely took the crown of 2022 from disney i watched the bad guys  and thought it was definitely a new step for dreamworks as it showed us what animation can give if done correctly puss in boots the last wish didnt just do animation correctly it perfected it it has a great story which at sometimes can be dark  great characters with well written and each has there own charm humour which is funny for children and adults and best of all animation with heart soul and passion put into it whether that be its cinematography backgrounds characters art style or world building its those little details like that that have given animation itself a better name its movies likes these that gives me hope that the animation  industry will wake up more and realise that people actual want effort for a change and not the same old way to make money    animation  1010  story  9510  characters  1010  humour  910    final score  1010
Feb 13 2023,positive,i think this movie had great animation quality and was visually stunning it had a great story line and plot and is definitely worth watching had great characters and an amazing villain people of all ages will enjoy this hilarious adventurous movie one of dreamworks best films in a long time

Feb 13 2023,neutral,mehok the storyline itself was okay but just a little too weird and my grandson was like who is little jack horner thinking they could have used a more recent bad guy so the kids could relate
Feb 13 2023,positive,good for whole family all ages
Feb 13 2023,positive,i dont usually review movies but feel the urge to after seeing puss in boots the last wish its been a long time since i came out of the cinema feeling pure joy for a film i am one of those people who loved shrek 1 and 2 deciding not to watch the sequels and spin offs after so when i heard about this puss in boots movie i wasnt jumping to see it my partner saw the trailer and was eager for me to watch too once id seen the trailer i knew there was something special and different happening with dreamworks this time    obviously the visuals were the no1 thing that drew me to the film i loved the inspiration they took from into the spiderverse i also see a bit of arcane and wes andersons fantastic mr fox the fight scenes are epic like attack on titan    the characters are hilarious and i loved the themes that played throughout if youve ever experienced anxiety or depression and have started therapy this movie will probably stir up your emotions hopefully in a good way i absolutely recommend everyone see this movie if dreamworks keeps this creative team id be excited to see what theyll make next this is the kind of creation that disney is falling behind on
Feb 13 2023,positive,completing the return to form for dreamworks animation that began with abominable and continued with the croods 2 and the bad guys puss in boots the last wish just might be one of the studios best films since how to train your dragon 2 with gorgeous spiderverseinspired animation exhilarating action sequences  though not quite as jawdropping as the sea beast  a chilling villain welldefined characters some cameos that felt like reuniting with old friends and some really good lessons about coming to terms with your own mortality as well as a beautiful new logo for the studio thats arguably better than the shortlived one from httyd 3 puss in boots 2 just might be one of the best animated films of 2022 a visually stunning darkly humourous fantasy adventure thats possibly one of the best installments in the shrek franchise since shrek 2
Feb 13 2023,positive,the combination of different types of animation was amazing
Feb 13 2023,positive,this was not for children under the age of 7 it had too much violence for the little ones

Feb 13 2023,positive,wolfdeath verry sexy would smash
Feb 13 2023,positive,this was the first animation i watched in 10 years i was blown away by the artistic style camera movement and unforgettable cast of characters although im 22 i was enjoying this move as if it was made not for kids but for adults
Feb 13 2023,positive,it exceeded my expectations in terms of plot it was much more nuanced than the previous movie all of the characters were once again lovable and with distinct personalities in some ways there were many cliche and memey moments but even so it didnt bother me at all and simply added to the movies charm though those moments were cliche they all served a purpose in sharing a slightly deeper meaning when thought about in a more serious manner however the animation style wasnt better in my opinion i know many people enjoyed the more cartoony style in this movie but i think i prefer the older one this one had frame rates that were slightly too low for me and sometimes the action felt like the theater was experience screen lag i also appreciated the detail in the first one more slight spoiler the last wish tackled themes of death and the fear of it as well as found family appreciation pride and more i was thoroughly impressed at how the producers executed these themes in a way that is entertaining and for kids while being very honest about them
Feb 13 2023,positive,such perfect dreamworks perfect everything perfect
Feb 13 2023,positive,super great story amazing visuals and it seems to be a movie that we didnt know we needed

Feb 12 2023,positive,there was nothing to not like about this movie it was great the humor was in point i loved every minute of this movie for sure
Feb 12 2023,positive,didnt see the original puss when it first came out but over the christmas season i chose to be sentimental and watch for some feelgood joy to see the adventures of a furious male cat as he strives to control the world in addition the settings and tone made it enjoyable to watch puss roam be slinky and sip milk the movie also looks good and has a cartoonish color scheme so even though its not tom and jerry many adults found it to be entertaining to watch antonio banderass performance as the voice of puss is excellent and the work and onscreen chemistry are also superb
Feb 12 2023,positive,this movie is very fantastic my white family laughed at this movie new villian new animation style congratulations to all who maked the movie congratulations to dreamworks for hard work in my opinion we need shrek 5  which i dream to this new movie they will add at the end puss marry kitty  i hope shrek 5 will ge good

Feb 12 2023,positive,exceptional one of the few movies i actually really enjoyed and gotten me intrigued from the start to the end loved the comic book animation which will age greatly instead of trying to look realistic and look much worse when new tech came the story and character development too 1010 for both adults and kids

Feb 12 2023,positive,the story the characters the jokes are very very fun 100 would recommend to everyone
Feb 12 2023,positive,this movie is a lot better than it needed to be when studios seem to just pump out uninteresting sequels and spinoffs to grab the cash of poor parents who begrudgingly bring their kids to watch annoying talking animals and bright colors     no this film goes hard from the fresh animation style to the well written and acted script to the dazzling action scenes you can really tell the animators and everyone actually put heart and effort into making something pretty amazing     its one of those wow where did this come from moments that makes you forget this isnt pixar  this is a sequel to a spinoff of a 4 film franchise of which it breathes new life into     along with sonys spiderman into the spiderverse and the mitchells vs the machines this dreamworks film should be a wakeup call to disney and pixar who are now at serious risk of falling behind with their tired animation and direction     the oscar nomination for best animated feature is well deserved
Feb 12 2023,positive,i liked the story and the fact that its pointing towards another shrek movie also loved the fact that theres no wokeness in it

Feb 11 2023,positive,i went to the theaters with high expectations considering all the good reviews and believe it or notthey were exceeded immensely im shocked at how spectacular this film was its nearly tied with shrek 2 as my favorite shrek related film its not quite as good but it came pretty close that alone should tell you how good it is the animation has a spiderverse like feeland the action scenes were spectacular now lets get to what everyone is talking about the villain the literal personification of death death is honestly such a scary villian for a kids movie i was shocked at how intense and suspenseful his scenes were everytime you heard his whistle you new stuff was about to go down i liked jack horner as a surprise villian hes existentense was kinda spoiled by social media but i wont spoil anything here goldie locks and the three bears were a fun addition im shocked the film didnt feel overstuffed puss in boots was very good having to face his mortality and some heavy subject matters kitty softpaws also had a good arc about trustand the world trust wasnt said a million times like a certain disney movie perito was a funny addition that never got annoying i love how optimistic he was considering his backstory this movies story was dark about puss being down to his last life and looking for the last wish and death hunting him down this is a must see for all ages 1010 one of the best dreamworks and shrek related films

Feb 11 2023,positive,the best animated movie of the year i didnt know dreamworks were making a sequel for 2011s puss in boots until the movie came out and i didnt know what to expect from it entering the theater and i thought it will be one of those generic kids movies to my surprise it had very touching scenes like when perrito calmed down puss when he had a panic attack which is something you dont see in kids movies or at the end when puss realizes that he doesnt need to wish for his 9 lives to be restored and that he should cherish his last life also goldilocks and the three bears crime family thing was weird in a good way they had some very heart warming moments like when goldilocks said that she wants a real family and not the bears the bears were sad to hear her wish but they agreed to help her later on goldi saves kid bear while saying that the family she has is just right big jack horner not a lot to say casual rich power hungry character just that he is a maniac he doesnt care for his crew or anyone really besides himself and to my surprise he isnt annoying just a grown up child sad backstory though death there isnt really anything i can say about him that wasnt said before he is the perfect villain he terrifies puss the legend who was never touched by a blade fear for for his life puss ran away to mama lunas cat house some time story happens puss meats death while seeing his previous lives as they mock him for being a coward and not the legendary puss in boots and he keeps convincing himself that the wish will make him the legend once again and then death arrives remembering their previous encounter puss starts to run he also saw death when he kitty softpaws and the bear family jack horner fought for the map he heard deaths and took off puss fights death one last time but this time he appreciates his last life then death leaves and he says to puss you know well meet again right i know lobo lobo death  so yeah good movie perhaps i jumped places hear but good movie pusss relationship with kitty is very good perrito is amazing he is so positive that he doesnt realize that his tragic past is tragic good jokes very good fighting scenes similar to spider man into the spiderverse  go watch it in the theater it is the best movie now 12223 for the american 21223 it is worth a watch in the theater make this movie earn why it deserves which is more the avatar way of the water  one of the best movies i have ever seen a 1010 for what its trying to be and a 1010 for a movie

Feb 10 2023,positive,this movie defies all expectations of what should have come of this franchise after shrek 2 dreamworks used this beloved franchise to milk as much money out of our loved characters as possible the first puss in boots movie is a generic bland adventure film however this movie is a massive bounceback for the franchise the lovable characters and the beautiful animation carry this movie along with the fun plot and the amazing settings the bleeped cursing from the characters is a bold comedic flair that only adds to this masterpiece
Feb 10 2023,positive,beautifully animated great story and amazing characters
Feb 10 2023,positive,this movie was fire the villain is the best part

Feb 10 2023,positive,dreamworks decision to reprise a beloved character has paid off puss in boots the last wish is a truly amazing film beautifully animated with an absolutely terrifying villain in death
Feb 10 2023,positive,an incredible movie really interesting and fun to watch it has an interesting plot and good humor good animation and an excellent sequel it left me reflecting on the end simply a masterpiece
Feb 10 2023,positive,this movie is amazing after i got out of the theater i rewatch it again i love this movie i totally recommend watching this movie and i cant wait whats going to happen to dreamworks new movies in the future
Feb 10 2023,positive,what a blast a quality addition to the shrek franchise while maintaining the humour and fun this film is surprisingly mature as it deals with themes of mortality and introspection the cast is stellar and the visuals are top tier the best dreamworks movie since shrek 2
Feb 10 2023,positive,the movie has a heart with a very good animation quality and style the movie really stands out in those areas the story is predictable from the middle of it but it is told in such a way that when the end comes it leaves you wanting more as the characters already won your heart
Feb 10 2023,positive,the animation was spectacular i loved all the characters especially the villains there was some confusion for me when certain people teamed up at the end without verbalizing anything to each other but other than that it was a solid movie  some reviews say the movie isnt appropriate for kids but in general yes it is if they are at least five or six in my opinion    it is rated pg meaning parental guidance is suggested as some material may not be suitable for children so there will be things that might be surprising i suppose  the movie says the word hell and they do use a bleeping noise to suggest when characters are cursing obviously they dont use the words its just a bleep  the violence is very cartoonish the main villain might spook a child under the age of five
Feb 10 2023,positive,my baby boy george loves this movie and hes got a big u know what
Feb 10 2023,positive,stunning visuals great animation and fantastic development this movie is by far the highest quality in dreamworks catalog this movie somehow managed to juggle three protagonists and three conflicts flawlessly the art is stunning with dynamic backgrounds and a painted esthetic that fits with the fairytale theme the animation is fluid and dynamic from changes to the frame rate to the visual effects this movie should be an inspiration for the future of dreamworks animation
Feb 10 2023,positive,this movie combines action and fear in a way that i just love the main villain in this movie is menacing and i just wouldnt expect that from a dreamworks movie the ending is pretty good and im pretty sure puss in boots is my favorite dreamworks character overall a awesome movie 9510
Feb 10 2023,positive,this movie is amazingthis movies art style is so unique and the characters are all greatthe main villains are really goodthe wolf is so menacing and goodthe fun is nonstop and cant wait for the 3rd if it is madepuss and kitty have great chemistry and purrito is adorablethere is nothing bad about this movieamazing movie and the best shrek movie ever 910

Feb 9 2023,positive,peak animation oscar incoming
Feb 9 2023,positive,this movie is amazing enjoyed every second of it
Feb 9 2023,positive,amazing story line with great lessons for people of every age fantastically written characters that show growth throughout the film besides the antagonist who is almost comically evil and above anything else the art and animation is probably some of the best i have seen in a very long time pixar could never pandora from avatar is skidrow compared to the artwork and attention to detail in this movie yes the writing is a little cheesy at times but this is also a kids movie so i wont hold that against them overall might be my favorite movie of the last year
Feb 9 2023,positive,an absolutely astonishing movie with and incredibly amazing plot
Feb 9 2023,positive,greatest movie ive seen in a long time the animation is dynamic and unique the comedy hits every time the characters are impeccable and the villains are perfect and the music i cannot get enough of this movie 100100 please see this movie
Feb 9 2023,positive,my grandkids my daughter and myself nana loved this cute take on the beauty of family  the introduction of the cute little puppy totally made this movie i was surprised there was a tiny bit of questionable language but not enough to distract from this adorable concept of family
Feb 9 2023,positive,dreamworks did such a good job with the vfx in this movie the characters are pure charm and i just loved the antagonists definitely recomend to everyone in all ages
Feb 9 2023,positive,woah did dreamworks actually just surpass disney
Feb 9 2023,positive,such an exciting animated feature by dreamworks this movie doesnt get the credit that it deserves but its definitely nominated for an oscar this film is so exciting from beginning to end with action pack scenes an emotional dialogue the comedy twist and the character development is all exciting and lives up to the hype i highly recommend this film for anybody interested in checking out an animated feature on the big screen before it leaves theaters completely
Feb 9 2023,positive,i loved it character development was just amazing and the new enemies were great
Feb 9 2023,positive,masterpiece this will go down in history as shrek

Feb 9 2023,positive,intricate plot incredible thematic music throughout visuals were off the charts
Feb 9 2023,positive,the best movie of 2023 so far
Feb 9 2023,positive,puss in boots the last wish was great this movie isnt a cash grab movie like most movie these days but rather a well thought and balanced animated movie that takes risk even for a family friendly movie it welcomes heavy scenes and by that i dont mean light hearted heavy scenes from the emotional depth of each characters of the story and the best antagonist i have seen in a long time in an animated movie i concur this is the best animated movie that have come when it was released and i would say its even on par with shrek 2 personally this movie is right there with spiderman into the spider verse as my favorite i just cant pick which because theyre both great lol
Feb 9 2023,positive,well done animation with fun dialogues and good soundtrack
Feb 9 2023,positive,one of the best animated movies i have ever seen     i hope more movies will be like this it genuinely may be one of my favourite movies of all time i made an account just to review this no animated movie will be like it for a long time
Feb 8 2023,positive,a little too intense for my 6 year old grand daughter
Feb 8 2023,positive,for a movie targeted towards kids it absolutely exceeds expectations dealing with themes in mental health trust and belonging its got a great message for all to see
Feb 8 2023,positive,love absolutely one of the best animated movies of all times
Feb 8 2023,positive,brilliant movie from the animation characters and pretty much everything else the villains is dreamworks best ever this is just simply amazing 95100
Feb 8 2023,positive,this was my second time watching this movie and i still love it to this day  story got really good if not better  you have three villains with three different morals but two of the same goal  witch makes me love death so much do to him trying to kill puss in boots and try to fulfill his own purpose  jack horner is just some guy who went through his joker ark  cuz some wooden boy named pinocchio fucked up his life  and goldie just wanted a normal family cuz she wants to feel like she fits in and be the sore thumb that sticks out in a bear family    in finale words   dont be a greedy ass hole  have your moments with your family  and try to enjoy life while you still can
Feb 8 2023,positive,wasnt expecting such a genuine portrayal of a number of themes must see
Feb 8 2023,positive,the movie was such a great movie most movie sequels are worse then the first ones but puss in boots the last wish is a better movie then the first movie everything in this movie is just great it has perfect balance between serious and comedy serious issues like anxiety and panic attacks are shown in a serious matter and build the story the antagonist of this movie is one of my favorite of all time without spoiling to much this antagonist really changes the movie and is my favorite character many characters go through some great character development like puss in boots who has some of the greatest development you grow to love the characters as the movie goes on 1010 please watch it if you can the animation in this movie is very eye catching and gorgeous as well
Feb 8 2023,positive,after i saw the dogs belly i need a therapy dog not that one
Feb 8 2023,positive,looked like a watercolor movie it had some of my favorite actors and was decently funny
Feb 8 2023,positive,a kids movie being more mature than an adult series ohhh i love when this happens yea im watching you velma 100 pirated
Feb 8 2023,positive,i went to see this movie this past sunday i went into this movie off the hype i was hearing about from other people so my expectations were high for the movie which can often only end in disappointment when a movie doesnt live up the the idea of it within your own mind     im glad to say the movie not only met my expectations but sailed way above them    the voice acting sound effects animation story and camera angles in every scene were phenomenal from the most gripping fight scenes to the most heartwarming scenes to compare i recently also went to see the sequel to avatar as well and if i was asked to make a choice between the two it would but puss in boots without hesitation     the characters and story had development and character arcs that i didnt expect to have in a puss in boots movie however that only made the movie the more refreshing and gripping youve got heroes and villains that are incredibly relatable as well as the comically villainous villains which all culminates an incredible finale for the characters and viewer     if youve the choice between this and any other movie out right now pick puss in boots
Feb 8 2023,positive,we need more of these well thought out movies and not some cgi crap from marvel
Feb 8 2023,positive,this animation style provides a fresh crisp style and the script isnt dumbed down for only children fantastic villain and heros journey would absolutely see again
Feb 8 2023,positive,puss in boots the last wish is the perfect animated film  you might think im exaggerating because its an animated dreamworks  film about a talking cat in shoes from the shrek universe going on a typical adventure but thats because you arent looking deeply enough into the film about a talking cat form the shrek universe puss in boots is at its core a story about the idea of laughing in the face of death and coming to terms with our undeniable mortality and a story of living your one or nine lives the best you can its a story that juggles anxiety and panic attacks paired with the feeling that death is looming around you constantly waiting to strike and its a film about what fear does to you and what it does to your relationship and your life    puss and boots starts with puss going on a normal adventure  throwing a party and then killing a giant but then he dies which he seems completely unfazed by until he realizes hes on his last life and is prescribed retirement     ive never been a fan of the dreamworks art style its just never stood out to me but with puss in boots  the last wish  i genuinely enjoyed the way they animated it their use of the more 2d art style in a mostly 3d animated film was gorgeous and definitely did more than offer a nod to spiderman into the spiderverse it genuinely excites me that one of my favorite animated films spiderman into the spider verse could be having such an effect on animation and the industry the animation in spiderman into the spiderverse genuinely made me so happy and i thought the scenes were absolutely gorgeous ive been animating for multiple years now and ive won competitions for my animation and i love animation analysis and both of these movies really stand out to me    not only is this movie gorgeous but its also smart this movieas i said tackles bigger topics and enthralled you with its gorgeous animation but it also appeals to the right audiences because of course its a kids film so kids are going to watch it but whos taking them to the movies adults how do you appeal to adults thats a question the animation industry has been looking at for years theyve tried things such as more adult jokes which the shrek universe is famous for but in the end they just feel like cheap laughs i took my dad and my sister to see puss in boots the first time i watched it and my dad genuinely laughed at parts he found lots of teh humor amusing such as the jiminy cricket sketch and the goldilocks dynamic this movie appeals to lots of people and does it well and they have the numbers to prove it
Feb 8 2023,positive,purrfect i havent seen it i just remember the original
Feb 8 2023,positive,very funny and creative great family movie
Feb 8 2023,positive,a visually stunning film puss in boots is well written and directed excellent job on the pacing joel crawford the script is character rich perro goldilocks and the bears little jack horner ethical bug and more and they are so organically woven in i couldnt get enough bravo of taking on the topic of death in a very kid friendly way and while the wish upon a star is not new or a fresh take been done and is more ownable by other franchises the movie managed a fresh take on the journey through the black forest to reach it so giving credit where credit is due
Feb 8 2023,positive,the animation is fantastic and is the best animated movie next to into the spiderverse
Feb 8 2023,positive,the wolf was hot love him also great story
Feb 8 2023,positive,such a whimsical creature my heart is fluttering

Feb 8 2023,positive,hes one of my favorite cats  it was a great movie he had me cheering for him
Feb 8 2023,positive,great movie this was my second time watching it
Feb 8 2023,negative,it was ok but not great  the plot is recycled from 1000 other films and paints some other storybook characters as villains  not appropriate for younger kids and too thin for older kids and adults  kids 1015 will probably enjoy it    it does glamorize drinking stealing and being fugitives to a degree
Feb 8 2023,positive,i loved everything about the movie and so did my grand grand daughter
Feb 8 2023,positive,1010 funny cat helped with my existential crisis unironically 1010 action 1010 pacing every scene felt like it belonged 1010 characters some were too real like death is how i imagine death to be 1010 ending the animation was stellar all around but the ending made me cry at how beautiful animation could be it wasnt even a story beat and it made me cry went in expecting a cashgrab bleakly animated marketable trope filled hellscape mess but got one of my favorite movies ever make shrek 5 like this and ill die happy
Feb 8 2023,positive,it was a very cute story very funny and surprisingly scary great for the whole family
Feb 8 2023,positive,it was the best puss in boots movie eeeevvvvveeerrrrrrr it had action and adventure and kitty soft paws and im not an zoophile but if i was woof woof or should i saw meow
Feb 8 2023,positive,you gotta love puss in boots  fun family film  take the kids or not  its enjoyable bring the popcorn
Feb 8 2023,positive,it was everything a movie should be 1010 would recommend
Feb 8 2023,positive,a fun movie that is fit for all ages refreshingly new with a touch of nostalgia
Feb 8 2023,positive,one of the best animated movies in general with an amazing antagonist give this movie your money so we can get more movies that clearly put their heart and soul into animation
Feb 7 2023,positive,damn good love this cat
Feb 7 2023,positive,this is the 2nd best shrek movie it takes a few watches to get all the jokes it is very much in the style of spiderman into the spiderverse
Feb 7 2023,negative,this is an adult movienot a kids moviead advertised
Feb 7 2023,positive,fun watch and entertaining throughout the movie 
Feb 7 2023,positive,this has the best animation i have seen in a few years it has that creative and fun stylization that you expect from animated movie unlike the overhyperrealism pixar seems to be going for plus the fight scenes are soo good story is also pretty good it handles a sensitive subject in very mature way a way that you wont expect in an animation movie   in my opinion the highlight of the movie must be the villain an absolutely terrifying and deathchilling antagonist
Feb 7 2023,positive,villains where hilarious
Feb 7 2023,positive,the only animated movies that blew me away from the last decade are how to train your dragon the croods and how to train your dragon 2 gets an honorary mention puss in boots the last wish is the first in this decades list hope dreamworks keeps making more like this
Feb 7 2023,positive,puss in boots the last wish tells a mature story about death and acceptance the comedy is very enjoyable and doesnt leave a dry taste in your mouth all i have to say to dream works is surprise me i look forward to the future
Feb 7 2023,positive,easily the best movie of the decade
Feb 7 2023,positive,this movie is a masterpiece everything about it is perfect  the story the characters the animation the sound design even the pacing its an absolute pleasure to watch and i recommend it to everyone  the story is great despite being an animated movie deeply connected to ones made previously for children it doesnt sway from tackling more deep and challenging problems the main characters go through a lot in this movie and it is reflected by their behaviour  the sound design is immaculate certain sound cues being played at perfect times to signal danger fear or comfort it is perfect to the point of the whistling one character does becoming very iconic and every time it appears you know they are near  the animation is top notch workers at dreamworks clearly putting in a lot of effort to create the best in a long time characters move through the environment clearly interacting with it as they go making us feel like they really are there instead of just being pasted in later the animation is fluid so when an enemy moves with less frames per second you can tell they are dangerous and clunky and when later the same animation style is done to the main character while escaping you know they are the ones in danger the animators doing little tricks like the one previously mentioned shows just how skilled they are in the art  the characters are all memorable each ones personality being very defined and different from the others this leads to some conflicts but also is a nice way for them to interact without it feeling forced the new additions to the cast  the little dog the main villain and others dont feel shoe horned in instead feeling simply like extensions of the world we just havent seen before  this movie was masterfully done in all aspects and i cannot recommend it enough to everyone you should most definitely watch it or youll miss out on one of the most amazing movies ive seen in a while
Feb 7 2023,positive,i am a 23 year old man and this childrens animated movie has become my favourite film of all time it is perfect in every aspect story characters pace dialogue animation sound track all of them 1010 i can genuinely think of no faults to this film and it is one that can be thoroughly enjoyed by all ages perfectly balancing light hearted comedy with some deeper themes and important life questions and messages  i will be going back to see it on the cinema screen several times before it leaves theatres and i will be bringing as many family and friends as i can because it is just that amazing
Feb 7 2023,positive,it was absolutely brillaint best animated movie of the century the animation was great the villain characters were amazing the plot was good nothing bad about it its soo enjoyable 1010 easily
Feb 7 2023,positive,have to admit this is actually better then the first love the animation fight scenes are perfect and the style they use for it it the story was great very funny even with some adult themes that are blurred out over all really good movie
Feb 7 2023,positive,know this is what i call a movie thanks dream work for this masterpiece
Feb 7 2023,positive,i enjoyed the characters
Feb 7 2023,positive,going in i had low expectations because i did not love the first puss in boots but this movie blew me away it was funny heart warming and overall the story had such amazing themes the animation was also phenomenal and all of the voice actors gave a great performance
Feb 7 2023,positive,it was good especially the story
Feb 7 2023,positive,best movie ever made certainly better than the new avatar movie i loved the morale of the movie the animation was also spectacular the low fps bright animation just ties all together so well the villain  protagonists were all written so well while death was just doing his job jack horner was pure evil this was such a good movie and dreamworks didnt dissapoint
Feb 7 2023,positive,top 3 movies i have ever seen its sooo good
Feb 7 2023,positive,awesome moviegreat story love all charactersla mejor
Feb 7 2023,positive,it had a very interesting twist
Feb 6 2023,positive,awesome loved the movie and the ending scene daaamn that means something o d
Feb 6 2023,positive,great family movie enjoyed it with my fiancée
Feb 6 2023,positive,i have always been a big animation fan i grew up with shrek franchise but honestly i didnt expect anyting special from the movie cause the dreamworks studio and animation having not the best years how wrong was i  after absolutelly horrible movies about boss baby dreamworks ressurected with amazing puss in boots for examplei exspected perrito to be a regular dumb comic relief and i was wrong again its a very good character who makes sense for the plot and other characters evolution the villians  base both jack horner and wolf catch the eye it was so brave to do that serious villians i respect that the animation the music the drama side characterrs locations designs jokes shrek and farytales references  i noticed that all and all authors hard work dreamorks is back on track and ready to meet disney on the animation battlefield again like back in early 2000s they have already gave a lesson how to do an amazing family movie withot trying to follow all fashionable trends
Feb 6 2023,positive,amazing movie every character is lovable the jokes made me audibly laugh and the villains in the story are some of dreamworks best death will always be my favorite character in this movie the visuals are nice with the comic book look and give the backgrounds a nice pop of color
Feb 6 2023,positive,this movie was absolutely incredible it has a very good message about the value of life and some of the best villainsantagonists i have seen the significant characters had a captivating screen presence and were all so much fun in addition to that it portrays anxiety in a realistic way when it shows puss having a panic attack the visuals were a stunning mix of 3d animation watercolor and that spiderverseey style    as far as story goes it serves its purpose of humbling puss and develops his character in a believable way while still keeping him as the same lovable feline    i admit i initially thought perrito would have been the stereotypical annoying kevin hart side character but i couldnt have been more wrong he was surprisingly lovable and endearing he even helped puss through a panic attack in the same way real therapy dogs do     jack horner was absolutely hilarious goldilocks and the three bears were surprisingly wholesome and death filled me with pantsshitting fear every time i heard his whistle    puss in boots the last wish is altogether an incredible movie 100 a must watch
Feb 6 2023,positive,the heros journey is an absolute timeless classic puss in boots manages to frame that perfectly into its own theme while developing side characters just as well  i didnt expect such a good movie  the visuals are a blast steering away from realism and turning into a colorful animecomicbook action style
Feb 6 2023,positive,when i first heard that puss in boots the last wish is coming out i did not expect to like the movie so much at some moments of the movie i was sobbing and at some i could not stop laughing it was a roller coaster of emotions this movie is for all ages me and my whole family watched it all together and we all loved it the movie was so witty and funny the animation was elegant yet so smooth    the movie had so many characters which most of you already know from your childhood like goldilocks and the three bears little jack horner big bad wolf which in this movie he was represented as death even though you think you know these characters in this movie but there their story was explained more and they acted more different then what you would think i would like to explain how but that would be like a spoiler i would rate it 1010  it was purrrfect 
Feb 6 2023,positive,beyond mind blowingly amazing and fantastic truly oscar worthy by far probably my best animation movie of all time shocked and suprised in the best way this movie is going to get every award wish i could give it 10 stars beyond worth it to watch love this movie to bits
Feb 6 2023,positive,a beautiful movie my kids loved it great plot charismatic characters a very well written story  the people who made disneys pinocchio should watch it 20 times to learn how to make a worthy film today
Feb 6 2023,positive,best movie of 2022 even beats the batman in my opinion     must watch

Feb 6 2023,positive,puss in boots the last wish is an absolute fantastic movie beautiful art stlye mixes und super awesome villains a perfect movie with a perfect villain  the wolf
Feb 6 2023,positive,this movie is the best movie ive ever seen i am disappointed with it only having 95 on the tomatometer it deserves more but 95 is still high  anyways lets get in topic  in this review we will have 7 categories to cover and rate  characters the characters are a sweet and pure 1010 their backstories are very creative with goldilocks perrito and jack horner and the characters dont make you feel like they are just added in because the studio can it makes you feel that every characters have their main purpose of being in the show every character is just a puzzle piece in this movie  casting the cast for the movie is gold 910 john mulaney fits the role for jack horner and death sounds so good every character feels like if the animation speaks without any person voicing it mouse syncing is very good too  villains 1110 no explanation here wait no 1110 its not gold its diamond  animation animation is super good like how they use a similar style with one of the best movies out there spiderman into the spiderverse but instead of making the visuality looks like a comic book they made the visuality looks like a fairy tale book it looks so bright and actually give that art made out of paint fairy tale book vibe  plot 1210 the plot is what brings together this magnificent movie so no explanation same for the villain  action 10010 this is like an anime type of combatfighting fast paced effects that is more likely to make you watch every single part of the scene and sounds in those scene are so satisfying  soundtrack 810 fearless hero is a banger my favorite out of the bunch is horner heist no context
Feb 6 2023,positive,literally perfection
Feb 6 2023,positive,one of the best masterpieces ever created ngl only negative is that its more for adults than kids d
Feb 6 2023,positive,this movie was fantastic the visuals the action the character the plot and script this movie talks about fear and its depressed but it still be a kids movie
Feb 6 2023,positive,genuinely one of the greatest movies of this generation the writing was amazing the animation and the voice acting was beautiful the writing wasnt scared to get dark for a pg movie genuinely feels good animation is coming back compared to what we had recently overall its a must watch
Feb 6 2023,positive,bro when i say this is the best movie i have ever had the privilege of watching i mean it its god tier its amazing its about a silly cat who is scared of dying and has to get over their huge ego the thought process put into this movie was never ending and i cant stop thinking abt it the 3 main characters all focus on one aspect of time the mc cat puss worries abt his future and how will he continue life if he can no longer be reckless the second cat kitty focuses on the past as she struggles to trust anyone from what happened in her past and perrito the dog focuses on the present as he believes he should cherish anything he is given and dont get me started on the animation and character development ohh and how could i gorget the greatest songs made of late 2022 who is your favorite fearless hero 
Feb 6 2023,positive,the movie was amazing the writers gave us a beautiful fusion of childrens stories with some more mature elements to it for older viewers messages of the inevitably of death wishes pride and so many more were tackled here and my only complaint is that it wasnt longer    for sensitive parents there are two moments where blood is shown on screen but they are very brief and the equivalent of a paper cut
Feb 6 2023,positive,i dont write reviews a lot but for this one it was so great i just had too the plot line the charcter development everything was just amazing i 100 recommend the movie was super deep aswell the way they portrayed the fear and anxiety with puss and boots was phenomenal the charcters are so well written the whole goldy locks and the three bears concept was just so amazing it was so unique  the whole movie was absolutely beautiful between the storyline and the charcters the movie had me smiling laughing and even cry with how wholesome some parts were   not only was this animated movie able to convey a good story but it was also able to convey a good moral and real life issues such as anxiety 10000 loved it  100000 recommend
Feb 6 2023,positive,the story the humor the animation
Feb 6 2023,positive,another family friendly feline flick a story of family friends and the ideal value one should place on what is truly important in their lives my 10 year old loved being familiar with all the characters and their individual stories some tear jerker moments a lot of good chuckle moments too the animation reminded me of the movies before but they seemed to have implemented a sort of comic bookesque style of animation as well if youre familiar with the animated spiderman thats where it felt like it was pulled from
Feb 6 2023,positive,wow okay a kids movie about a cat with boots was not one i expected to hit every single mark i have in order for a movie to be considered great     and yet here i am    everything about this movie is really phenomenal i wasnt going to go see it but heard good things and thought well i havent been to the theaters in a while why not so glad i did i will be going again the storytelling is literally perfect or puurfect sorry it doesnt treat the audience as stupid everything just flows so perfectly and theres no lecture telling us what the moral of the story isinstead the movie trusts in its own ability to tell a story the villains are fun and interesting the humor actually lands i actually cried who knew an animated movie about a cat would bring me to tears    this movie hits home on so many levels addressing so many raw human fears that are incredibly relatable it has a good moral and good submorals and its fun its so much fun to watch highly recommend ill definitely be buying this on dvd when it comes out
Feb 6 2023,positive,best movie this year so far amazing animation and story line also i liked the characters as they were all well made with proper backgrounds and fitting voice actors great job dreamworks

Feb 6 2023,positive,nice animation and a couple of good laughs main story aim a little random but then it is a fairytale
Feb 6 2023,positive,this was a cute movie very well written storyline i mean it is puss in boots
Feb 6 2023,positive,a sequel to a bland spinoff has no right being this great   puss in boots the last wish has plenty of heart colour and charisma thats brought to life not only from its visuals that are quite simply fantastic but from a passionate voice cast that oozes energy vapid and superbly edited action scenes that carefully utilise its spiderverse style swagger at the right moments humour that hits more than it misses satisfying story arcs and emotional beats and all of this is seasoned with a delightfully mature approach towards its themes proving yet again that the best kids films are the ones that  much like its terrifically scary villain  arent afraid to get a little dark
Feb 6 2023,negative,horrible not a pixar quality film
Feb 6 2023,positive,this is literally the best film of the last 5 years no question

Feb 6 2023,positive,family loved it definitely fun cute and funny
Feb 6 2023,positive,i like the way that the three bears and goldilocks both cats and the dog all got their wishes without even having to make those wishes it shows if youve got a good heart it will come shining through and the movie did that in a wonderful way that leaves you feeling happy at the end the message that the movie gives is really sweet and good for all ages alike

Feb 5 2023,negative,i thought it was a kid friendly movie not really probably need to be 10 i dont know why it need to be so dark of a film seemed very unnecessary
Feb 5 2023,positive,story was good larger guy was kind of weird
Feb 5 2023,positive,i absolutely loved this movie i am a huge fan of puss in boots and this movie completely did him justice i love the character development we have and cant wait to see more of him
Feb 5 2023,positive,we all loved it kids and adults really sweet movie
Feb 5 2023,positive,an excellent addition to the shrek cinematic universe which weaves the spiderman into the spiderverse animation style into its action sequences choosing to develop goldilocks florence pugh and the three bears helped to contrast all of the families and their unique dynamics
Feb 5 2023,positive,loved goldilocks in the movie
Feb 5 2023,positive,it was amazing the art style the comedy the storys pacing loved it all
Feb 5 2023,positive,i have seen this movie four times twice in theaters and twice at home and even after seeing it this many times it never gets stale each scene of this movie is crafted wonderfully with each character serving their purpose perfectly and even the fact that this movie still makes me laugh to this day that really says something this is now my favorite movie ever a movie filled with action and themes that are both for kids and adults highly recommend watching this to incentivize dreamworks to make more of these films
Feb 5 2023,positive,a fun wonderful movie and im a grownup
Feb 5 2023,positive,entertaining animation couldve been better plot was a little silly 
Feb 5 2023,positive,this film is brilliant  it completely captured the shrek vibes and executed it even better than the first one  the animation is gorgeous characters amazing good writing music is beautiful and the jokes capture the goofy lil shrek vibe i love    i was also in tears multiple times and the ending and prologue are so hype holy shit

Feb 5 2023,positive,an absolute must see movie i am normally not a massive fan of animated movies but this is excellent from start to finish funny  great little story too
Feb 5 2023,positive,fantastic worth multiple rewatches characters are all so dynamic
Feb 5 2023,negative,this was a vacuous shell of a move lacking everything that that made the first one so endearing what a stinker  watching the beginning song and dance sequence that introduces the newly animated look of puss i was dismayed at the cheap looking slapstick action lacking any of the charm that oozed from all the characters in the original that had incredibly detailed expressions  it set the tone for the whole rest of the movie  all the clever humour and emotion that appealed just as much to the adult audience was gone and replaced by hannabarbera type cartoony action  maybe mildly entertaining only for kids below the age of 7  also without meaning to sound ageist banderas and hayeks voices were simply too old and croaky to be fitting for the characters unfortunately sounded more suitable for grandadgrandma type characters
Feb 5 2023,positive,awesome movie with fun characters and absolutely stunning visuals
Feb 5 2023,positive,very entertaining a great written sequel for both kids and parents
Feb 5 2023,positive,amazing family movie halarious and was overall such a fab film
Feb 5 2023,positive,it doesnt matter how old we get moves like this are always worth it great sequel loved it
Feb 5 2023,positive,this was so cute loved it
Feb 5 2023,positive,i like everything   cool storywell done
Feb 5 2023,positive,one of my favourite animated movies of this year great experience the fights the action puss himself a goat the soundtrack death as a villain and his haunting signature whistle all the characters are so sick if youve seen movie clips online and people tell you its amazing take there word and go watch it
Feb 5 2023,positive,considering how terrible the first puss and boots was i was beyond skeptical that this was going to be just another bad animated action movie boy was i wrong    this movie was a wonderfully crafted masterpiece dream works out did themselves by finally making the puss and boots movie many early 2000s viewers of shrek 2 have been wanting to see since the introduction of puss   the movies story was incredibly thought out and had so much genuine character something the first film lacked speaking of characters every single character was amazing going back to the twisted fairy tales we have seen all the way back with the first shrek each character was well thought out from goldie and the 3 bears to jack hawner each one was fine crafted i must personally say though that there was a definite outlier death every single time he was on the screen he stole the show from the design to backstory and his signature eyrie whistle the designers knew exactly what they were doing by making death as bad ass as he is     the story and characters all though excellent would not have been as marvelous if the animators stuck to the original shrek style instead they overhauled it and went with a much more spider verse style which perfectly complemented the story and action to a tee i love that the company understood what made the last puss in boots movie so flawed and set out to make perhaps one of what must be the pinacol of animated movies up there with the likes of how to train your dragon and toystory everyone i went to watch this with was talking about the animation and characters for hours after our first watch and i personally can not wait to watch it again as well as draw some fan art for this movie     dreamworks pride yourself on a movie made perfectly and please keep up the top work additionally if i could give you a higher score i dam well would
Feb 5 2023,positive,this was an amazing watch good animation amazing character development  animationvillains jokes ect   anything good i can think of saying about this can be said
Feb 5 2023,positive,who is your favorite fearless hero
Feb 5 2023,positive,fun movie we took our grandkids and we all enjoyed it
Feb 5 2023,positive,great for kids and adults
Feb 5 2023,positive,better than i thought it was going to be which was also true of that other cat movie sequel    perhaps its the calibre of the acting talent providing the voices with salma hayek and olivia coleman costarring with the returning antonio banderas    those who are allergic to there always being a moral to these stories should be warned that the multiple morals for puss in boots and his fellow travellers on the grandest quest yet are all banal mawkish and forgettable
Feb 5 2023,positive,this movie was a masterpiece the visuals are beautiful the storytelling is top tier the characters are very cool a must see
Feb 5 2023,positive,it was really funny romantic great movie the girls loved it
Feb 5 2023,positive,the most accurate description of anxiety and mortality in a kids movie
Feb 5 2023,negative,its not a kids movie its more for adults it contains some inappropriate language
Feb 5 2023,positive,incredible movie i was blown away when i saw this every small detail in the movie is incredible and the animations are very fluid and smooth while the voice acting is just as good the plot is really well crafted and the movie overall was pretty good truly a masterpiece
Feb 5 2023,positive,i love how it has three types of villains redeemable goldilocks irredeemable jack horner and just doing its job death
Feb 5 2023,positive,this movie is the greatest movie ive seen in a while i throughly enjoyed watching it you could call this movie peak and boots because of how much this is peaking rn literally no cap this movie almost made me go crazy
Feb 5 2023,positive,words cannot describe it but w
Feb 5 2023,positive,movie is awesome hope they continue with how the ended with far far away
Feb 5 2023,positive,my favorite film of the entire 2022 and there were lots of amazing films the art feels revolutionary the themes are mature and the writing treats the audience with respect the comedy lands most every time and it is clear the movie was made with tons of passion for the project itself this is the best dreamworks film in a decade to give you an idea of how good this movie is
Feb 5 2023,positive,amazing movie the animation is absolutely beautiful the story is also really good and interesting the writing is really good but the best part is the villans
Feb 5 2023,positive,every time i looked over at my kids face i saw a smile the movie is a delight from end to end
Feb 5 2023,positive,hilarious great movie for the whole family
Feb 5 2023,positive,at first the movie seemed too childish for my liking yes i know it is a kids movie but still i had heard the movie would talk about some very mature topics and to my surprise by the end it did the movie touched on things like overcoming fear appreciating the family you are given and being proud of who you are i was more than impressed by the end and advise many to check this movie out
Feb 5 2023,positive,this movie was pretty awesome thought i was just going to sleepwalk through it with the kids but i think i enjoyed it it as much as they did
Feb 5 2023,positive,amazing makes me feel chills
Feb 5 2023,positive,we took the grandkids ages 6 to 14 and they all loved it
Feb 5 2023,positive,overall a great movie
Feb 5 2023,positive,really sweet and entertaining
Feb 5 2023,positive,the movie was not only the best in all the puss in boots movies but arguably one of the best movies in the last 5 years overall it is a classic redemption arch type movie filled with lots of action spectacular music and relatable and memorable characters the morals taught in the movie are also incredibly inspiring but the best part of the movie would be the villain death who reminds puss and the viewers of the importance of living a life not to the fullest but instead live a life of true meaning 1010 already planning on watching again
Feb 5 2023,positive,as a dad i actually enjoyed this movie probably laughed more than my kids
Feb 5 2023,positive,very funny and adorable
Feb 5 2023,positive,after more than a decade dreamworks has finally rewarded us with the longawaited sequel of puss in boots     they have done so in such an amazing way with a blend of lovable remarkable and wellmade characters an incredible story with a thoughtprovoking plot about life and of course a spectacular animation with attention to details that make it continually dazzling to watch    overall for all lovers of animation this stunning movie is a mustsee and i cant recommend it enough

Feb 4 2023,positive,this movie was genuinely amazing the animation was breathtaking i didnt look at my phone once during watching it made me cry a little too
Feb 4 2023,negative,while the first puss in boots was funny this is extremely violent and frightening had to leave the theater at the request of my child 7 who states that one of her favorite movies is the first pib the wolf is psychotic and the other villains are well beyond pg see this movie with children only if you want to desensitize them and purge them of innocence
Feb 4 2023,positive,great nicely paced movie great villain great hero and overall great story with a good ending
Feb 4 2023,positive,as a family we absolutely loved this film  the animation was stunning great story and its very funny

Feb 4 2023,positive,this movie was incredible the animation was breathtaking the voice acting was on point it was fastpaced the action was so well done it has one of the best movie villains ever and definitely earned its pg rating

Feb 4 2023,positive,great movie incredible characters a pretty good story and possibly one of the best animated villains of all time
Feb 4 2023,negative,didnt live up to my expectationsso many years of waiting for nothing 
Feb 4 2023,positive,the movie was phenomenal the animation was outstanding not only that but the character development of our little hero was absolutely brilliant and i love it so much
Feb 4 2023,positive,i saw this in movie theaters and i went out shaking that movie should be 100 on rotten tomatoes
Feb 4 2023,positive,so good i created a rotten tomatoes account just to rate it
Feb 4 2023,positive,not as funny as expected
Feb 4 2023,positive,absolutely charming fantastically lovely character designs does not hate the audience but instead remains charming and entertaining towards them using the spiderverse style of animation added to it without a doubt lovely voice acting but above all super wonderful coriography for all the moves and action just a genuine pleasure to get to honestly and sincerely enjoy something good
Feb 4 2023,positive,this movie is definitely my favorite animated film at the moment the artstyle and animation is captivating and brilliant death as a villain is menacing and well done and the story is fast paced but easy to follow i highly recommend the last wish
Feb 4 2023,positive,its a good movie what else is there to say
Feb 4 2023,positive,animation in this movie is absolutely beautiful storytelling is good and there is nothing boring because the film is not that longcharacters in the movie was played so good and everybody was diffrent in charakter

Feb 4 2023,positive,the movie made sure to establish expand on and conclude each significant character throughout the film very well i could greatly tell that a lot of love went into this sequel because the story was very rich and found its soul i suppose in a metaphorical way very rewatchable due to that heartfelt and powerful feeling and message it delivered well best film ive seen in a looong time
Feb 4 2023,positive,amazing movie brought me to tears multiple times highly recommend
Feb 4 2023,positive,brought back what animation was about beautiful movie one of my all time favorites
Feb 4 2023,positive,went and saw this movie with my friend yesterday after hearing about how good it was on social media it absolutely lived up to the expectations and i would even say it blew past them some of the most realistic depictions of mental health for an animated kids film with compelling characters and stunning art i thoroughly enjoyed it and will hopefully be seeing it in cinemas again with a different friend i speak some spanish and loved being able to understand what was said when they switched languages it helped make the film even more immersive for me and the oneliners from death in spanish were so much more chilling because i could understand them  plus the wolf was hot always a bonus    all in all absolutely a movie i would recommend and definitely one i will be talking about for quite a while
Feb 4 2023,positive,as a family we loved it 
Feb 4 2023,positive,with 2022 bringing many mediocre movies to the table puss in boots the last wish left 2022 with a bang    from being just an off shoot from the shrek franchise this movie really lives up to the legendary name of puss in boots the 2011 film being just a meh movie of puss in boots really didnt feel remarkable in any way but the last wish this is what makes movies so great to watch     such a simple plot to follow accompanied with such rich and dynamic characters and relationships really keeps you to wanting to see more of these characters interacting and talking     not a single character felt underutilized even the characters that didnt have much screen time had their role fulfilled the story had such maturity with several difficult topics to tackle for a pg film they absolutely handled them correctly and almost perfectly humour is definitely a strength of this movie with a broad range of jokes from such different characters
Feb 4 2023,positive,so the animation was good and the antagonist death was actually really good its just that the plot and story was kind of lacking
Feb 4 2023,positive,great movie if you liked shrek as a kid youll love this
Feb 4 2023,positive,blew my expectations out of the water fight choreography and animation is amazing story is great too emotional and funny had such a good time in the theater great watch for adults and kids in my opinion
Feb 4 2023,positive,my son and i loved it
Feb 4 2023,positive,loved the movie  must see
Feb 4 2023,positive,overall a solid movie beutifully animated doesnt lose its charm for even a second i definitely recommend it
Feb 4 2023,positive,is it a childrens movie yes does it contain bleeps over what would otherwise be vulgar language yes however it only adds to the comedy in my opinion it has its dramatic moments the way it shows a fearless hero having a panic attack gave me representation on the screen that i never thought would be possible not only that but the villain is one of dreamworks better villains i would say that this villain is on par with the fairy godmother from shrek 2 not to mention the artistry and creative choices they made with the animation and the lighting effects were phenomenal i will always recommend this movie to those that adore the shrek franchise
Feb 4 2023,positive,cute movie lots of action
Feb 4 2023,positive,must see this is a classic in the works
Feb 4 2023,positive,this was really good i was worried it was going to be a waste of time but it was actually a fantastic movie definitely a keeper
Feb 4 2023,positive,an incredible movie that surpassed my expectations and had me smiling the whole time would watch again
Feb 4 2023,positive,the movie was great but the seats themselves were terribly uncomfortable
Feb 4 2023,positive,i liked that there was content for viewers of all ages and the story was beautiful
Feb 4 2023,positive,was a great movie from beginning to end will recommend everyone to watch this this is a movie for the entire family
Feb 4 2023,positive,fun movie for adults and kids good music and    graphics will watch it again
Feb 4 2023,positive,as far as a kids movie goes this was pretty good it kept my attention and the kiddo liked the action a lot they had some good jokes for adults and it had a nice heartfelt story the animation was incredible
Feb 4 2023,positive,peak fiction just peak fiction
Feb 4 2023,positive,might be the greatest movie of all time the wolf is terrifying and i had nightmares for weeks all around and awesome movie i will watch it for the rest of my life the dog is a great side character that adds humor and sadness to the movie the other villains are really good and bring a lot of action and emotion to the film pusss relationship with soft paws is very good and was displayed very well
Feb 4 2023,positive,great movie ive waited too long for another puss movie
Feb 4 2023,positive,this movie legit made me cry at the end the story was masterfully crafted
Feb 4 2023,positive,showed what was really important in life family
Feb 3 2023,positive,absolutely brilliant film i absolutely loved it im 24 and my neice 5 and nephew 9 equally loved it would definitely recommend for all ages especially if you like these types of films 
Feb 3 2023,positive,the trailer left that feeling that it would be good but it was better in all aspects compared to the first one which i dont even remember how marking it was  i loved what they did to one of the antagonists and how he affects the cat most of the jokes work its a shame they show the montage of lives in the trailers the arcs are well divided the characters goal i can say that spiderverse had its share of influence in the animation which is beautiful  the team has a lot of work ahead of them if they want to make one more and the cat is an excellent character who deserves the challenge  you can watch it its really worth it 
Feb 3 2023,positive,kids will love it especially my kids
Feb 3 2023,positive,this is my favourite movie for now i was on it 2 times and for sure ill go again this animation looks easier than from the last parts but even better and prettier idk why lol its weird it never happend to me like i always dont like much the female company with the main male characters but now i literaly love kitty softpaws too and perrito of course even the villain death wolf well i dont think that death is a villain hes just doing his job thats all the villain of this move wich i hate is jack horner i dont hate him just for nothing it was made by dreamwork to make us hate him wich is incredible made wow
Feb 3 2023,positive,it was a really good movie
Feb 3 2023,positive,i cant stop watching it its too good lol
Feb 3 2023,positive,this movie should of been overstuffed but somehow they juggle everything to make what is a near perfect 80s movie and what i mean by 80s is that its way scarier than a modern family film with themes and tones that do not treat kids as stupid amazing movie that stands alone from the shrek franchise and easily the best since shrek 2
Feb 3 2023,positive,hands down one of the best animation movies ive ever watched not going to lie i had to stop twice as it made me cry perrito the dog character is so beautifully written its amazing how you can sense the pain through his innocence any person who has a dog can see the innocence in him i found myself laughing outloud right after having cried and there are very very few movies out there that can do that to you     the new animeinspired fight scenes add beautifully to the overall artistic rendition and the writing is just topnotch nothing to say about the voiceacting from banderas to moura and hayek its just perfect      i dont give reviews often but it is an absolute mustwatch watching the first movie helps keep track of the story so its also recommended 1010

Feb 2 2023,positive,when i saw there would be a sequel to the first film i wasnt very excited the first film was good but nothing really that would make it an instant classic it is somewhat similar with the last wish with a slight difference  the writing art style and characters were briliant the humor was great and overall the i can really say that it is a must watch not really an instant classic but a very good film overall
Feb 2 2023,positive,who must have a third movie puss please its to good and goofy make another please or at least      a cameo in shrek 6 make it please
Feb 2 2023,positive,in love with this movie i grew up with the shrek universe and puss was always my favorite ive been waiting for another movie since the first in 2011 i loved the characters jack horner was genuinely one of the funniest villains ive seen in a bit the only complaint i have is with the comic book style of animation and the fact it was only used during highaction scenes i never thought that style looked good to begin with but having it exclusively in moments with actions just makes it look like a game thats lagging because the computers hardware cant keep up

Feb 1 2023,positive,puss in boots is happy the movie
Feb 1 2023,positive,climatic masterpiece honestly
Feb 1 2023,positive,illumination needs to take notes dreamworks has laid out the blueprint on how to make a good sequel this movie was fantastic and it started with the animation i love this new visual direction that the spiderverse is pushing everyone into and puss in boots the last wish capitalized the action sequences were so quick and comiclike and the colors popped beyond the look the story was quite good as well dreamworks picked a good handful of messages to deliver and they did it well i especially liked the arc with goldi and the bears but the very real and very persistent personification of death was alsofun maybe not the word but i was very interested there was a great blend of heart and humor and the voice cast was outstanding especially florence pugh and john mulaney this is certainly the best kids movie ive seen in a while and i hope the minions take full offense
Feb 1 2023,positive,nice movie but i have to say it used to be better
Feb 1 2023,positive,honestly the greatest movie ive seen in the last 3 years this movie is well worth watching and 100 worth your money no agenda no politics not virtue signaling just downright amazing storytelling that i didnt know how much i missed
Feb 1 2023,positive,best animated film of the year absolute banger
Feb 1 2023,positive,one of the best designs i loved the most is finally recognized for his greatest work
Feb 1 2023,positive,i dont like the painterly design of the film i wish they used shrek animation style which is my favorite in all animations
Feb 1 2023,positive,this movie has altered my brain chemistry
Feb 1 2023,positive,great story line grwat action truly family friendly this has got to be one of the best dreamworks production
Feb 1 2023,positive,puss in boots the last wish had a lot to live up to as most of my critic and casual friends have been praising the film and for the most part the film delivers    from the opening frames the unique art style fills the screen and is incredibly captivating there is some excellent combination of 3d animation with 2d styles that i have not seen before the combat frame rate shift was also a nice touch that worked better than i was expecting action was top notch with some incredible set pieces and superb choreography    the last wish deals with some pretty heavy themes for an animated childrens movie death is something that all humans will have to face which was handled in such a nuanced and mature way here from panic attacks to haunting imagery death looms large throughout the entire film and serves as a menacing villain the journey our heroes take to confront this fear is very heartwarming and will resonant with most audience members    with most dreamworks pictures the comedy is targeted at both children and adults i did find myself laughing out loud at plenty of jokes but just as many landed flat for me this would be more of an issue but this is an incredibly balanced film with great action and dramatic moments that leave little room for a few flat jokes to make a large impact on my experience    i genuinely believe that this movie has restored the shrek universe and can propel the future projects upward hype has officially been restored for shrek 5    score 86  verdict great
Feb 1 2023,positive,genuinely good movie of course its not better than the og but its a worthy sequel that honors the original definitely worth the watch
Feb 1 2023,positive,so very cute and so funny
Feb 1 2023,positive,i love the movie all of it the animation was so great the facial expression or gestures were so smooth and details that i can easily feel with the characters
Feb 1 2023,positive,it was a very contained story that didnt add unnecessary extra stuff the side characters were a nice addition usually super happy characters are annoying and overplayed but the one in the movie was written well the villain was very intimidating and the message was well recieved
Feb 1 2023,positive,myself and my sister were huge fans of the original and i can say this absolutely blows the original out of the water best animated film since how to train your dragon
Feb 1 2023,positive,it has no right to be this good but it does it anyway
Feb 1 2023,negative,the only explanation i have for all the positive reviews this movie is getting is that most of them come from adults who watched it with teens or without children we went to the cinema with a group of 610 year old children trusting the 6 and above rating this movie got in germany and it was an awful experience for them    copious amounts of violence some cartoonish and played for laughs some way too intense for kids references to and portrayals of gambling  alcohol a lot of swearing  rude language sometimes censored sometimes not references to animal abuse partially played for laughs and an anthropomorphic wolf character who symbolizes death and whos significantly too terrifying for young children multiple kids in the cinema started crying had to be escorted out of the hall or had to close their eyes for large stretches of the movie at one point a character calls another character a pssy  which is a somewhat lame cat pun in the original english but in german thats lost in translation and ends up being straight up vulgarity that has no place in a movie rated 6 beyond those crassly childunfriendly elements the plot of the movie and the underlying themes living the life you got facing death  fears were neither interesting to nor understandable for our kids another issue was the fake spanish accent of the main character since we saw the movie in german i cant judge the original voicework but in the german version the main character was sometimes very difficult to understand even for the adults    this movie illustrates a larger problem age ratings have become practically meaningless and we essentially need to prescreen every single movie were considering to show to our kids to make sure its actually ageappropriate and wont cause pedagogic issues in this case trusting the german film rating board the fsk reading reviews and watching the trailer beforehand was evidently not enough and we regret taking our kids to this movie thank you fsk for deciding that a movie that makes our kids leave with the mental image of someone drowning a puppy in a river is appropriate for ages 6 and above     those issues aside from an adult perspective this movie was thoroughly meh the comicbook animation style was neat for the first few minutes but became jarring later on since it was applied very inconsistently the plot was somewhat bland and the characters didnt really stand out with the possible exception of the dog the sideplot of the bear girl and her adopted family felt tacked on and the ending felt somewhat satisfying but very telegraphed most of the jokes werent offensively bad but didnt really land either and most of the references just served to remind us of older much better movies that we could have been watching instead the quality of the voicework keep in mind im talking about the german version specifically ranged from okayish to aggressively poor    definitely not a movie were going to see again and definitely not a movie we would have shown our kids had we known what we were getting into beforehand
Feb 1 2023,positive,i loved death and the story was amazing
Feb 1 2023,positive,its great amazing movie dreamworks has  redeem a legend
Feb 1 2023,positive,fantastic story animation and comedy
Feb 1 2023,positive,absolute masterpiece the story has a good moral the animation is soooo cool every facial expression of puss is perfect i love the musics i could watch it 100 times in a row definitly recommend it
Feb 1 2023,negative,say hola to his little friends    puss in boots the last wish is a 2022 american computeranimated adventure film produced by dreamworks animation and directed by joel crawford      meh it passed the time   just       while i enjoyed the animation and humour the story and humour disappointed    puss in boots discovers that his passion for adventure has taken its toll he has burned through eight of his nine lives leaving him with only one life left puss sets out on an epic journey to find the mythical last wish and restore his nine lives
Feb 1 2023,positive,great movie both artistic and story is deep and well done as good as a pussy in boots can be
Feb 1 2023,positive,it was a beautiful film
Feb 1 2023,positive,the best villain  it was really nice and fun to watch the fact that i as an adult and a kid can watch together and still both enjoy it to the fullest  great animation
Feb 1 2023,positive,just finished this movie with my friends and it had no business being as good as it was the action was super crisp with that animeesqe style that was made so popular by movies like spider verse and the villain was genuinely threatening with plenty of good laughs throughout all in all this movie not only surpassed my expectations but blew them out of the water i absolutely recommend it to any adult who grew up with the shrek movies and was hoping for another good movie in this universe
Feb 1 2023,positive,this is easily one of the best films ive seen in a long time it was entertaining funny but was also able to handle the heavy topics like death and facing your own mortality perfectly i would highly recommend everyone watch this movie
Feb 1 2023,positive,amazing humor and action sequences i absolutely loved this movie
Feb 1 2023,positive,amazing film the animation was incredibly emersive and the voice acting was perfect the plot of the movie was moving and really struck a chord with me and many others who viewed the film despite it being a childrens movie amazing villains and antagonists that all play an important role in the film pretty great movie
Feb 1 2023,positive,perhaps the best movie all year definitely a tie with top gun maverick   fun at all ends and even when it slows down its enjoyable   all the characters bring something of value to the table and have interesting and entertaining stories   wonderful narrative captivating visuals and a beautiful message through out
Feb 1 2023,positive,i will say as someone who has always been interested in the animation industry for quite some time now this has to be one of the most inspiring pieces of media to come out in recent years with all honesty i havent been so lifted from my seat and excited about a film such as this since spiderman into the spiderverse which i must thank for the seismic level shake it had on other studios for taking animation to the new level of storytelling which i believe this film provided the soundtrack as well is outstanding every single song on the album is a worthy hit which deserves to be replayed again and again dont believe me go check it out on spotify or youtube anyway as much as the film was a flavorful and visual expressive ball of energy it knew the perfect moments to slow down and take in impactful moments and allow their audience to take it all in which leads me to discuss the topic of the film mortality and by the stars they encapsulated it perfectly i was moved for i believe it is something all ages and walks of life can understand the inevitable and looming presence which death holds within all of us the anxiety which we hold until we too are at that pass which we face the inevitable nonetheless we continue and decide to make the most of the single life we are given to fight for the life we want with those we love and care for i have not seen a film tackle such a hard and difficult subject in quite some time and successfully i might add in conclusion this is an outstanding and captivating film which deserves to be talked about for years to come
Feb 1 2023,positive,i really enjoyed watching this movie it was funny and really good
Feb 1 2023,positive,i genuinely cannot find a flaw with this movie after my 3rd watch i was still left wanting more this movie does everything perfectly from the animation to the story to characters everything is perfect if this movie doesnt win an oscar they should be very ashamed
Feb 1 2023,positive,cute movie love puss in boots

Jan 31 2023,positive,it was perfect in every aspect it has some of the greatest characters in animation history and the 3d mixed with 2d animation style is beautiful with that amazing colours another hit from dreamworks 2 in a row
Jan 31 2023,positive,i absolutely loved it i was 7 when the first movie came out and it was one of my favorites at the time i was worried about this movie but within the first 10 minutes i loved it there are a lot of easter eggs referencing the previous movie and the shrek films but you could certainly watch this movie without any previous knowledge of the character and still enjoy it
Jan 31 2023,positive,is the prettiest and best animated western childrens movie in existence yes    is it more than that not really the opening fight sequence is fantastic and any time the animation team executed on an action scene holy crap they were hitting home runs    but at the end of the day beyond a few scenes of genuine wholesomeness and tenderness its still just a western animated childrens film if thats all you ever watch youre going to be very pleased if you enjoy broader media this is fairly formulaic    goldi and the bears carry the film
Jan 31 2023,positive,i think the movies script is really good but im not too fond of the animation i miss the old animation of the old movie and the shrek movies
Jan 31 2023,positive,puss in boots the last wish is truly an amazing movie that people need to watch this movie is easily one of the best childrens movies out there and a lot more people need to see it this movie is about characters trying to get the wish they want and they are doing anything to get it but while puss is trying to get his wish we see how scared he is of the new villain death and how much fear he gets we can see how puss is trying to get his 9 lives back while meeting his old wife and making a new friend to get the wish at the end of this movie we get to see how puss matures and leaves the last wish while fighting death to let go of the fear of dying this movie is truly special and shows you not to be scared of something and to fight back

Jan 31 2023,positive,this movie is absolutely outstanding the art style is gorgeous the animation is fluent the fight scenes are well choreographed the story is mature yet fun at the same time all the characters are great the villains are a threat to the good guys and death is most likely the best villain in the dreamworks catalogue if you havent seen this movie yet watch it now you wont regret it or maybe you will if you are deranged

Jan 29 2023,negative,im amazed how popular this film is i presume much of it has to do with how much we all love antonio banderass puss     the first film was brilliant  it truly had everything for just about every demographic and im not sure i stopped laughing from beginning to end i even enjoyed watching several episodes of the tv series that followed with my daughter who is now 8years old    this sequel was disappointing on so many levels not the least of which was editing it was too long 2 story line  a bit thin even for an animated feature 3 and this is the most important the writersdirectors didnt seem to understand the kind of film they were making while i understand the nature of the puss in boots created for the first film which i love as being a heroic and hopelessly nonselfreflective figure which makes him so wonderfully funny the sequel seemed to think it was produced by marvel studios filled as it was with overproduced action sequences that were simply boring and repetitive hence the need to cut 10 minutes     this will make a great case study in film school on how you take a sure thing and screw it up
Jan 29 2023,positive,best movie i ever saw it looked beautiful and the characters were great
Jan 29 2023,positive,amazing movie excellent plot amazing villains and hidden meanings the actual villain of the movie death is a costant presence that creeps the whole time the other antagonists are wery well structured and characterised there is an incredible character developpement for the main characters that really makes them all relatables i really enjoied the movie

Jan 29 2023,positive,with most companies making their films have an agenda and something political in them i would like to say this is one movie this year that has stayed true to the way movies should be about telling stories with shrek movies revolving around fairy tails and stories puss in boots really hits a home run with this movie i love how they were not afraid to go to some dark places and some dark storytelling with death and how they tied the ending i am glad to say this movie is now one of my favorite movies with its art style they took something that i did not expect and made it work really well in this film 1010 would recommend it

Jan 28 2023,positive,puss in boots 2 the last wish is a perfect sequel to a mid film theres not a lot wrong with the first puss in boots but this film is perfect in every way the villain is one of the best villains ive ever seen
Jan 28 2023,positive,very good amazing in fact
Jan 28 2023,positive,the subulities were good for older children and adults entertaining but a large amount of violence i think jack horners disdain  multiple ways of degrading and smashing his employees were a bit much
Jan 28 2023,positive,great animation impactful theme and message
Jan 28 2023,positive,it kept adults entertained as well as the kids  very good storyline as well  highly recommend
Jan 28 2023,positive,puss in boots the last wish is something that not only kids can enjoy but teens and adults alike the story is fantastic and delves into darker themes at times it features multiple villains all with different tropes and manages to pull them off fantastically with death and jack horner easily being some highlights of the film the characters are so lovable and the acting is great along with the humor absolute mustwatch easily the best animated film of 2022 and maybe even one of the best dreamworks has to offer
Jan 28 2023,positive,its so good just watch it already   i have nothing but praise for all aspects of the movie i never thought id be so enthusiastic about a puss in boots movie
Jan 28 2023,positive,great movie has a meaning behind it
Jan 28 2023,positive,absolutely fantastic movie from start to finish the music characters style animation every little bit was near perfection
Jan 28 2023,negative,movie wasnt too bad nor that great either i would give it three stars but have to take away star for the amount of cursing in it  warning to parents  gratuitous cursing in this movie some is bleeped but not all not a good family movie if you have young children
Jan 28 2023,positive,it was 11 years since i saw the last puss in boots and this one didnt disappoint great acting castanimation and very funny and emotional at the same time definitely a good family movie i would definitely see it again ps there are some bleep words in some parts of the movie but overall amazing movie

Jan 28 2023,positive,super pooper cool with epic animation and s tier character development
Jan 28 2023,positive,really funny and smart story telling
Jan 28 2023,positive,this movie was way better than i thought it would be especially for a spin off sequel of a shrek character i really like how this movie handled the theme of grasping onto your mortality and realizing whats actually important in life and that its more than just living up to your own legend it really made puss look a look at himself and forced him to realize all that he took for granted in favor of his pride     the animation was great i love it when animation strays away from hyperrealism and gets experimental like this i wish more movies to be inspired by spiderman into the spiderverse and i want it to be a trend humans are very artistic creative we should express that more    my only gripe is that while i actually enjoyed every character in this movie i kind of wish the bear family had less screentime or not exist at all in favor of focusing more on fleshing out puss kitty or perrito i was way more invested in those three than the b plot but honestly the bear family was enjoyable enough anyway     all in all i loved the movie and while i feel some of its potential was untapped i think this is a great step forward
Jan 28 2023,positive,absolutely phenomenal animation and very enjoyable a must see
Jan 28 2023,positive,movie was decent was not a fan of the new animation style

Jan 28 2023,positive,ironic comical and all around hilarious
Jan 28 2023,positive,one of the best of 2022 this film has a lot of laughs and stunning animated adventures but never is afraid to slow down and explore characters with earnest emotion and heart
Jan 28 2023,positive,going in i did not have high expectations but this movie blew that out of the water another absolutely amazing movie from dreamworks
Jan 28 2023,positive,i was a bit skeptical at first because i felt the animation would have been lazy compared to previous dreamworks films but man was i wrong    the story had a really good flow the characters were memorable especially the dog and the wolf and there were a few scenes that really made it feel enjoyable for older audiences    i think the only minor set back was the animation in the action scenes being to comic book styled    but look in my personal opinion this is a great film for the whole family to watch and i absolutely recommend it
Jan 28 2023,positive,watch it words cannot describe how good of a movie it is the mature themes that it isnt afraid to cover the relationships the characters have the amazing animation character depth are all reasons you must watch the film to understand how good they are
Jan 28 2023,positive,good story line funny and nice graphics
Jan 28 2023,positive,if only i watched this film instead of avatar i would have the best moments at the end of 2022 im not saying that avatar the way of water is not a good film i only regret not choosing a more suitable film to end 2022 story is phenomenal very emotional good soundtrack and such a great character development for each character on the movie

Jan 28 2023,positive,animation and models where great but the storyline wasnt that unique it was that simple bad guy ends up working with good guys to fight bigger bad guy
Jan 28 2023,positive,this has been one of the best animated movies ive seen in all time many people criticise that the visual style is similar than that of spiderman into the spiderverse but quoting pablo picasso a mediocre artist copies a great one steals this movie robs the visual style it doesnt copy it it makes it its own and goes to tell a beautiful story with it wellbuilt characters great arches a masterful villain not the plump trump and good comical writing mixed with deep messages a true work of art congratulations dreamworks  team
Jan 28 2023,negative,not appropriate for kids and not really enjoyable for adults characters werent funny overhyped

Jan 28 2023,negative,i took 4 of my grandchildren ages ranged from 25 to see puss in boots and was sadly disappointed  it had some inappropriate language and the story was on the darker side  the grandkids didnt like it either  i give it 1 star  dont waste your time and money on this one
Jan 28 2023,positive,puss in boots the last wish was a phenomenal movie the action animation and art style are all toptier the amount of work the studio put into the animation scenes must have been incredible because i cant stress enough how fluid the animation was i did some background research and the animation team that worked on this movie also worked on spiderman into the spiderverse which makes sense you definitely see it in their quality of work the story itself was unexpectedly deep i must say that for a childrens film the themes and symbolism are all quite complex and powerful if you are an adult watching with children i strongly advise you to pay attention the morals of the stories at the end are all very heartwarming goldilocks the three bears and puss in boots are among my favorites overall a fantastic film
Jan 28 2023,positive,the movie was great worth every penny
Jan 28 2023,positive,a fun movie with good messages  there were some tense moments but not overwhelming very sweet

Jan 28 2023,positive,this movie offers so much for the older viewers the character of death is chilling but rightfully so and the amount of hidden imagery to look for is amazing the animation is beautiful the storyline is fresh and emotional and this is definitely one i would recommend and will be watching again
Jan 28 2023,positive,love thisabsolutely charming  clever fun for all ages hoping they make a third installment sooner rather than later
Jan 28 2023,positive,this is so far the best movie in 2022 even with low budget they manage to execute everything perfectly great story line and a great sequel hopefully this wins an oscar
Jan 28 2023,negative,dark violent shouldnt be rated pg
Jan 28 2023,positive,really cute animation similar to spiderman in spiderverse art style of the movie really touch me back in 2011 when i watched puss in boots 1 i thought its gonna be last but thanks to the sequel puss in boots the last wish and i do not regret paying to see it
Jan 27 2023,positive,this movie was such a surprise for me  i usually am not a fan of animated movies as im 16 now but this completely amazed me  with some of the best character writing i have seen ever with the character death who was written with such expertise it left me in an uncontrollable state of tension and suspense when he was on and off screen  death is without a doubt my favourite villain to be brought to us definitely this year and possibly of the decade leaving me a young adult even a little uneasy at times which is the only reason that this movie is getting anything below a 4 star rating as many parents were worried thinking that death was too terrifying for a pg movie but please do not let this put you off as this movie is masterpiece  not only does it have amazing character development it also has amazing animation with dream works implementing a unique style to the movie with flashy colours    im conclusion i would without a doubt recommend this movie as a must see as i watched this movie about 2 weeks ago now and i couldnt get it out of my head how truly great this work was even motivating me to write a review for the first time in hopes that more would take up the chance to experience this masterpiece with big releases like avatar overshadowing the movie when in my opinion puss in boots is a far greater movie than avatar was
Jan 27 2023,positive,this was an amazing movie i loved the characters the story and the animation
Jan 27 2023,positive,absolutely fantastic movie my wife asked me to see this and i went reluctantly but after it ended i must admit this is one of the best movies ive seen in so long 
Jan 27 2023,positive,an absolute masterpiece the animation is phenomenal the story is original and brilliant puss in boots is badass and cute what more can we ask
Jan 27 2023,positive,movie was a awesome animation movie and love the battles
Jan 27 2023,positive,cute story has action scenes smaller kids might be scared to watch some mild naughty words and bleeping of bad words for comic effect
Jan 27 2023,positive,when i say this is brilliant movie it is an understatement to how beautiful creative wonderful of a movie this is a brilliant mustsee movie that you just have to watch over and over again because of much gorgeous details there are in the animation but also in the amazing writing that just has you enjoying the movies attentiveness to even the smallest details the animation style is plain fantastic and suits this kind of world so perfectly theres even beautiful writing in its soundtrack in its repetition to the fearless hero score that makes this movie that much more brilliant going to go see it again soon
Jan 27 2023,positive,this movie is the one to finally beat httyd as my favorite movie to think such great movie is an sequel to very avarage movie that puss in boots was is unbelievable it had everything from great animation style great character development drama great vilains and comedy that will make both adults and kids laugh it made in my opinion the perfect villain the death being present only a little bit but enough for you to not forget him and when he does show up hell always make you worry for puss and remember every scene with him in it hes exttemelly powerful and movie  acknowledges this by not letting puss defeat him other two villains the bear family and big jack horner are great as well and both complete opposites of each other while one has goal that can be understood and in the end gets redeemed the other one is straight up evil for no reason other than power puss also gets great character growth going from someone lone wolf who thinks theyre better than everyone else to someone who wants someone he can spend rest of their life with definitelly recommend this movie for anyone doesnt matter how old they are or what they like this movie has something for everyone
Jan 27 2023,positive,the best movie ever youll never see a kids movie or any movie amazing as this

Jan 27 2023,positive,the truth is that i liked the movie and i enjoyed it very much a very good villain that is death and this movie also gives you reflections that i understand is with death which values and enjoys life and respects death and what i understood with goldilocks and the three bears is that you accept and value your family this film deserves the oscar for best animated film
Jan 27 2023,positive,this movie was fantastic not just for little kids but even teenagers and adults surprisingly the villain actually strikes fear instead of the usual not so great antiheroes we are used to in childrens movies while it may be a predictable plot the story and the idea are superb
Jan 27 2023,positive,loved it for someone who watched all the shrek movies and the first puss in boots this movie is just the best aside from the life lessons it gives and the perfect characterization it was all put together so perfectly
Jan 27 2023,positive,this movie is absolutely amazingi still cant believe that theres bad reviews that say its bad because it copies the spiderverse style of animation like dude bffr many movies are doing that because they want to adapt to new animations style that are getting popular just because it has 2d with 3d and the change of fps like spiderverse does doesnt mean it is a bad moviei know wolf is overrated but cmon the symbolizing and everything related to him in the movie was awesome i just hope that this movie can pass the 300 million that it already has and i also hope that more people get to enjoy this masterpiece i loved the first movie and i really really hope that this movie gets more than 500 million like the first one did  sorry for my bad english
Jan 27 2023,positive,splendid definitely the best movie for 2023s opening
Jan 27 2023,positive,i love cats and i love puss in boots and i like how the story about him defeating his ego

Jan 27 2023,positive,great movie in fact i was not going to see it i thought it was for kids but you know its mostly for adults the cgi was spot on and the lines in the movies were relevant and meant some thing it had a story line for all of us and bought back a lot of memories and even funny nice movie it was recommended to me i will recommend this movie and perhaps see it again  nice job hollyweird  dreamworks nice job i guess you have a few creative people working for you keep it going monster ink
Jan 27 2023,positive,this movie is amazing so it would a better review to talk about why i and others like it specifically not say its great i would watch it again  so this technically doubles is a critique of the film industry   1 good story  graphics  writing all that stuff that makes a hit its vary rare these to all of these while also not having some other bad thing mess it all up    2 safe messaging or more accurately the movie has a message that doesnt  ruffle any feathers or a message thats only understood by one generation everyone fears deathall of us make bad choices and most people understand the need for a good family  it has no political messaging which vary rare that a big movie like this has no political messaging and everyone understands the messages it does have     for only two really good reasons a film can top the charts and make this kind of a masterpiece it will a strong contender for best movie of 2023 definitely
Jan 27 2023,positive,this movie had an amazing art style and a lot of passion put into it that can clearly be seen when you watch the movie its a lot of fun for the whole family me my sister 15 and my brother 6 all had a great time
Jan 27 2023,positive,this was really a cute little movie i really enjoyed it and the actors did a good job portraying the parts storyline was good too
Jan 27 2023,positive,after wallowing in mediocrity for over a decade making low effort movies dreamworks reasserts itself as a leader of animation just like they did in 2001 when they popularized and made the genre of 3d animation into the powerhouse it is today    i think they learned their lesson after being outshined by other studios for so long and decided to go back to the drawing board its clear sonys into the spiderverse was a big inspiration for the movement camerawork and stylization they do their best to make the fights as dynamic as possible with long shots with a camera as well animated as the characters as they swing and jump around the scene with impressive fluidity     the movie aims for a step above the more lowbrow elements of the shrek franchise while retaining all of its defining charm and creativity making it one of the most impressive accomplishments of the dreamworks team alongside shrek 2 another incredible sequel
Jan 27 2023,positive,beautiful animation vibrant colors that are appealing to the eyes and good plot pacing and comedic timing casting was also very good too especially john mulaneys performance enjoyable for all ages
Jan 27 2023,positive,so good  i loved this movie

Jan 26 2023,positive,the animation is amazing and it is a fun film funny and awesome
Jan 26 2023,positive,this movie blew me away i seriously did not expect a childrens movie to be this entertaining the comedy action and the way the animation would seamlessly transition between 3d and 2dish was cool to see as well i can confidently say this is the best animated movie ive ever seen with into the spiderverse as a strong second
Jan 26 2023,positive,idk how a puss in boots movie became a top 3 film of all time for me but it did
Jan 26 2023,positive,great art style amazing story will watch again
Jan 26 2023,positive,this sequel is far more appealing than its predecessor in every way from the beginning of the movie captivating animations combined with adventurous music attract watchers attention before watching the sequel i had low hopes for this movie but my opinions were immediately swayed at its very start this film grabbed my attention in a way much different than the first puss in boots did    in the last wish puss realizes that hes used up his 9 lives except 1 a grim reaper haunts him everywhere he goes reminding him of his possible death puss learns of a wish he can make on a star which he decides he will utilize to receive more lives he meets a chihuahua and an old friend on his way to find the star the movie covers his adventure to find the star and includes heartfelt scenes between multiple characters       overall the animations and scenery in the movie are enough to draw watchers attention the plotline of the movie is very interesting for viewers of all ages
Jan 26 2023,positive,exceptional far better than avatar 2
Jan 26 2023,positive,had a fantastic storyline puss is probably my favorite childhood character so maybe im a little biased seen it numerous times the animation was beautiful favorite movie

Jan 26 2023,positive,best animated movie in a while the antagonist and villains were really well done and the subject of the movie was handled well all around a good movie and just no complaints whatsoever
Jan 26 2023,positive,i didnt see the original puss in boots from 2011 and im one of the seemingly very few people whos never been a fan of the shrek franchise imagine my surprise then when i sat down to watched the feisty felines latest cinematic venture the last wish and got a massive kick out of it i dont have anything against the character he just happens to be a secondary player in a film series i never liked so he was never on my radar but his newest film is from what ive heard superior to the original and certainly more well regarded than the later shrek flicks its not only got a lot of great comedy but it manages to have its share of serious moments and treats them with respect when the characters are musing on the importance of family loyalty and the perils of mortality the film isnt constantly throwing in one liners of making obnoxious gags that take you out of the moment as such the characters feel real and for lack of a better word human the quest is fun engaging because you know what each individual wants and why they want it the animation borrowing heavily from into the spiderverse uses imperfections and roughness to make things look more like classic fairy tales and when the comedy hits usually unexpectedly it gets big wellearned laughs unlike spiderverse its not a game changer but the effort thats been put into its appearance its story and its characters makes it more than worth your time
Jan 26 2023,positive,it really okay not gonna lied about it
Jan 26 2023,positive,cat tries to find meteor while being chased by dog

Jan 26 2023,positive,at first ive decided to watch this movie just for the curiosity to see the wolf that have became famous on twitter but in the end the entire movie was really awesome another thing that must be said about this movie  the framerate its just like the spider man into spider verse  completely awesome  and makes all the different

Jan 25 2023,positive,puss in boots the charming and charismatic feline from the shrek franchise is undoubtedly one of the best movie characters of all time here are 10 reasons why 1 puss in boots is a classic fairytale character with a modern twist he is a swashbuckling swordwielding hero but also has a playful mischievous side  2 he is a master of disguise and deception able to fool even the most formidable foes with his cunning and charm  3 puss in boots has a strong sense of loyalty and honor always standing by his friends and fighting for what is right  4 he is a skilled warrior able to defeat enemies with ease using his sword and acrobatic abilities 5 puss in boots is also a romantic figure always on the lookout for true love and willing to go to great lengths to protect it  6he is a role model for children showing them the importance of courage integrity and perseverance  7puss in boots is voiced by antonio banderas whose performance brings a unique energy and charisma to the character  8 his soft and fluffy appearance combined with the rough and tough attitude makes him unique and lovable  9 puss in boots is a character that resonates with audiences of all ages making him a timeless classic  10 he is an iconic character that has become a cultural phenomenon with merchandise spinoffs and a solo movie  overall puss in boots is an unforgettable and memorable character his charming personality heroic actions and his unique abilities make him one of the best movie characters of all time he is a true embodiment of what a true hero is and he will always be loved by audiences worldwide  the movie was amazing

Jan 25 2023,positive,so lets be clear here this movie is one of the best things that couldve ever happened to the shrek franchise the animation was very well done and the plot story was very good but for me what makes this movie so enjoyable to watch is that we see death the main villain and man dream works out for themselves on himplus the idea that puss n boots could die truly increases the stakes of the movie very much so all in all it is a must see regardless of age
Jan 25 2023,positive,i dont know why some people says that the graphics for the movie are bad i really like how it looks i got captured into the movie in the giant part absolutely  amazing theres a lot of things id like to put here too but i wont talk that much you know

Jan 25 2023,positive,this is the best movie ive seen from this year and honestly tops anything i saw in the 2010s every single thing in this movie is executed perfectly the villain is a perfect love to hate character puss and kittys arcs in the movie are so strong and you really feel what theyre going though all while keeping the familiar feel the shrek universe is known for this is not only better than the first pus in boots movie its honestly one of the best movies ive ever seen the animation is incredible incredible the characters are well written and dynamic and its frankly just fun the whole way through its a movie thats not afraid to pull its punches and i love it  i really cant put into words my feelings about the last wish its an amazing animated movie heck its an amazing movie if you havent seen it youre missing out on something big

Jan 25 2023,positive,great movie one of dreamworks best
Jan 25 2023,positive,this was an adorable movie and really well done as far as animation and style are concerned the story is decent enough to capture parents attention as is par for the course for dreamworks animated films and the new characters are fleshed out well and humorous the bad guy is creepy and cringey so perfectly done as per dreamworks standards   although using their usual 3d animation theyve added some new timing and stylization to this movie so it has a bit of a different feel to previous installments of the shrekpuss in boots movies but for me its a welcome change i dig it  this is definitely an enjoyable family movie with plenty of hidden gems for mom and dad and adorable moments for the younger kids
Jan 25 2023,positive,both my brother and i are very critical of movies and while our opinions as two random teenagers dont really matter we could not find anything to complain about with this movie my only hope is that more people get to see this surprisingly amazing movie

Jan 24 2023,positive,such a fresh breath of air for mainstream animation death is a menace
Jan 24 2023,positive,this film was done beautifully it had very dynamic characters i will not say that it was not a great film but it wasnt really the film for me it had a lot of unnecessary crudeness and it was pretty violent for a family film the music was amazing the plot was fantastic but it also had its downfalls i did not like perito i do believe that the movie needed a character like perito with his innocent kindness but perito specifically was not a good choice also i feel like this film did not have good development for puss in boots because he had to relearn some themes that were taught in the first film
Jan 24 2023,positive,i thought it was really good  the animation was beautifully done and the story held my interest from beginning to end
Jan 24 2023,positive,puss in boots vs death wolf is the best fight 1010

Jan 24 2023,positive,what an amazing surprise this movie was im very glad i went to the cinema to see it the story is greatly paced the humor is very subtle  and comedic timing is good fight scenes are amazingly animated voice acting is superb and of course the wolf stole the shiw every time the puss got the chills so did i

Jan 24 2023,positive,legitimately super enjoyable  it was such a pleasant surprise loved goldilocks and the bears
Jan 24 2023,positive,the last puss in boots appearance i recall was back when i watched his tv series on netflix a few years ago i decided to try watching this movie since i have good childhood memories of the character upon finishing the movie i was immensly pleased as the film was much more better than i expected spider verse comparable graphics and the movie is much more relatable to us in the mental health perspective
Jan 24 2023,positive,it was funny i enjoyed the movie as a whole
Jan 24 2023,positive,this movie was so amazing i didnt really want to watch it due to the fact that the animation seemed very different than the last puss in boots and the shrek movies i thought it was going to be very cheesy and look cheaply made i was so wrong i will definitely watch it over again and i cant wait for the next one
Jan 24 2023,positive,this movie rocked me to my core    i went into this expecting a lighthearted shrekuniverse kind of comedy packed movie as the first puss in boots nothing too serious nothing too brilliant but funny enough that it would keep be busy for an hour and a half    i was gravely mistaken and i greatly underestimated this film    it was packed full of comedy but it was also very serious in the crucial moments that needed it not only that but it was absolutely brilliant everything from the animation and effects to the voice talents it was quite literally brilliant on my first watch i was in a nearly empty movie theatre save for about 10 other people and i cried my heart out at 2 very distinct scenes and then a third time when the lights in the theatre came back on as i realized that this moment me enjoying this incredible cinematic experience was over so what did i do  i went back to the theatre two days later and rewatched it and then i watched it a third time i watched this movie in theatres three times within the same week and yes i cried those other times i watched it too    i could go on and on about how great this movie is but i dont want to spoil anything and id rather people go watch it themselves    please go see it you will not be disappointed
Jan 24 2023,positive,this movies a throwback to when kids movies were good and less shiny
Jan 24 2023,positive,pretty good movie pushes the line of pg while still keeping it reasonable for a kid to watch the movie overall has a really good story compared to most and i never got bored enough to touch my phone

Jan 24 2023,positive,i loved the art and animation of this movie the way the panic attacks death and villains were portrayed beautifully
Jan 24 2023,positive,this is the best movie ive seen in quite a while yes it borrows animation techniques from into the spiderverse but it uses them well to elevate the movie visually the story is peak the visuals are peak theres nothing not to love with this movie
Jan 24 2023,positive,my son    a  loved it   didnt do it for me   s  but animation and villain portrayal were good
Jan 24 2023,positive,very funny kids movie but also had some older jokes great movie
Jan 24 2023,positive,a colorful cinematic masterpiece with splashes of animevideo gamecomic style artistic choices has you on the edge of your seat all the time with a magnificent cast with range from despicable to heartwarming characters villain of the year great message for both adults and children to take to heart adult friendly not at all boring perrito isnt a perrito he a goat
Jan 24 2023,positive,extremely hypnotizing and just the psychological inside of the movie film is just perfect everything is just perfect theres no words to describe how well dreamworks has succeeded this time  in my 20s i adore it
Jan 24 2023,positive,insanely good animation great mix of 3d 2d 24 fps and 16 fps in fight scenes with very fluid movements the storyline starts off quite generic but sprouts into something unique and emotional with great and well timed humor the returning characters are leagues more expressive than their original iterations and the new cast is also well crafted especially the villain which i and many others consider to be the best one ever created by dreamworks overall an amazing movie which i recommend for the whole family
Jan 24 2023,positive,one of the best movies of last year i sweat
Jan 23 2023,positive,went in without having seen the first puss in boots and the shrek movies not in a couple years all i have to say is one you dont really need to have seen anything with puss in it before this this movie standalone is a masterpiece a lot of stuff in it that i am not smart enough to delve into deeply but i can say as a surface level review after having seen it twice that this movie is amazing
Jan 23 2023,positive,excellent film perhaps not deserving of 5 stars but these products that do contribute something and are made with love deserve special treatment because there are more and more franchises that only make repetitive and soulless products  but this film is still obviously made to make a profit like almost everything in this market it manages to do something that feels special and doesnt neglect things like the characters or the narrative to be much more appealing aside brooo this film is visually a crazy i love this movie
Jan 23 2023,positive,perrito symbolizes the essence of this amazing filmeven without the free sweater and two buddies he would still be a happygolucky pouch
Jan 23 2023,positive,this movie is a masterpiece and greatest movie dreamworks have ever made
Jan 23 2023,positive,i absolutely loved this movie i grew up with puss in boots first in shrek 2 but later his own film i loved how they really made him more relatable and finally accepted himself and his life also shrek 5 very cool
Jan 23 2023,positive,it was great with great and funny characters sick animation and great moments of emotional depth i realized though the critic and audience scores have gone down slightly so im here to help fix that please make this a 100 on rotten tomatoes
Jan 23 2023,positive,it was much better than i was expecting it had a good message and it fun to see new and old characters interacting
Jan 23 2023,positive,oh i got to tell you it was perfect perfect everything down to the last minute details
Jan 23 2023,positive,this movie is a love letter to animation i love everything about it and you can see that every aspect of the movie was made with care and love for the project i could talk about how the animation is the peak of dreamworks by far but it would be too long the music is on point the characters are all interesting the narrative is captivating and the message gets everyone emotional everytime
Jan 23 2023,positive,oh it was fast paced entertainment that my teen daughter who has grown up watching all of these films still enjoyed watching along with myself  i liked how they managed to update the action scenes with more of a manga style animation without going too far  puss has his arc and he learns the live in the present and to love and cherish those around him
Jan 23 2023,positive,awesome movie wonderful animation
Jan 23 2023,positive,say hello to my gatito blade    edit on second viewing it is even better a truly remarkable film
Jan 23 2023,positive,i really didnt expect the movie to be this good the fact that it had many characters wasnt even bad at all they were all delivered perfectly and i loved the way the story teaches about morality trust and family while still being an animated masterpiece it was just right  i also love how the end fully confirms shrek 5 and after this i dont know what to expect
Jan 23 2023,positive,visually amazing if youre a fan of artanimation youre doing yourself a disservice to not see this multiple times
Jan 23 2023,positive,i loved this movie so much its a wonderful story that executes its message so well none of the characters are dull or annoying every one of them has an interesting personality it was a beautiful story and amazingly written characters loved the anxiety representation in puss 1010 would watch again
Jan 23 2023,positive,in one of the best year for animation this was one of the best animation last year for a reason driven by an amazing art married with one of the strongest writing for the past decade would make this a masterpiece and marvel for those who love this franchise and new to the franchise as it serves a potential cult classic for years to come
Jan 23 2023,positive,as a 23 year old this was one of the best movies i have seen in a long time highly recommended
Jan 23 2023,positive,loved it great example a keeping the formula that works
Jan 23 2023,positive,one of the only movies i enjoyed in recent times and the best animated movie ive ever seen the characters feel alive and do not blend in with one another they are all memorable in addition the story is fantastic and the message it tries and succeeds in conveying is important both to adult and children i reccomend watching at the earliest time possible
Jan 23 2023,positive,i dont usually rate movies but this movie was seriously amazing death was probably one of the bestdeveloped villains in recent years the story explores the fear of death and reminds the audience that life is happening now make the most of it and value the people around you this movie holds a special place in my heart storywise the best movie of the year overall second to avatar way of the water anyone that says its too violent i disagree the film balances the realities of life while maintaining a positive and optimistic message
Jan 23 2023,positive,i loved every second of it perrito and florence pugh were my favorite characters
Jan 23 2023,positive,words arent enough to describe how good this movie is
Jan 23 2023,neutral,puss in boots is not for the little ones any longer  it has grown with my kids and no sub titles  i turn them on for everything now but lots of spanish with no translations
Jan 23 2023,positive,i really enjoyed the animation in this one a visually dynamic mix of the expected cgi and a more stylized animation sequencing a la spiderman into the spiderverse the story itself was as good as any in the shrek seriescleverly scripted with very funny gags good storyline and likable characters
Jan 23 2023,positive,for a kids movie this was spectacular the characters are all so likable and the visuals were marvelous the story was really interesting and the way every character had ulterior motives to one another really made the movie rich with suspense one of the best dreamworks movies made
Jan 23 2023,positive,great caractheres a good history lots of action combined with humor quite the opposite of last disney disasters like lightyear and strange world
Jan 23 2023,positive,puss in boots last wish is so refreshing the villain is astounding and another great work from dreamsworks

Jan 23 2023,positive,animation lovers this is your thing
Jan 23 2023,positive,i wish i was lying when i say this is the best movie ive seen in a while i went with a friend as a joke just hoping for something halfdecent and was shocked at how much i genuinely enjoyed it the animation was beyond incredible specifically during fight sequences but also just in general dreamworks has been hitting it out of the park recently as far as animation goes and this may be their best yet i expected a cute but corny kids movie and got a commentary on embracing life in all of its brevity the protagonists story line was devastating the villain was terrifying i laughed out loud and cried multiple times and walked out of the theater wanting to be a better person the visuals the voice acting the story line theres nothing wrong with this movie i have never called a movie perfect before but that is exactly what puss in boots the last wish is
Jan 23 2023,positive,i could only watch the movie in 480p but it looked great even at such low quality they did fantastic with the writing and brought back the feeling of watching the original dreamworks shrek for the first time when i was a kid
Jan 23 2023,positive,amazing movie great characters side characters and villains were fun to watch had an impactful story with lots of depth and animation was absolutely phenomenal
Jan 23 2023,positive,this movie is amazing the art style the world the music the characters the story
Jan 23 2023,positive,one of the greatest animated movies of the decade
Jan 23 2023,positive,this movie is the bomb     for one this movie handles serious topics such as anxiety and death very maturely and isnt all in your face about best of all it doesnt degrade or ruin the character in any way it gives actual character development and makes it so relatable to watch    two this movie has great characters with depth and deeper layers that help make them more likable and better to see for example goldilocks wanted a family of her own blood but throughout the film she realizes that she didnt need a family like that and finally learned a family is connected by love rather than dna now that is depth right there    three the animation is amazing it is so refreshing to see dreamworks step out of their comfort zone in animation and try a new style to a point where everything is more vivid and colorful instead of the typical semirealism we see in dreamworks films    four it has a great villain i know it may sound like a notsobig deal at first but once you really think about the villain is always the hardest character to write and organize because everyone has a different idea of a villain and how they can give audiences a fearful presence well death was a perfect example of a villain because he was bigger and felt thrill in being the bigger person and scaring puss plus his whistle of death is terrifying and can absolutely be frightening to both puss and the audience the writers also were so good in giving death a vibe that communicated clearly to the audience that in a way he was there and he knew that puss was foolishly wasting his lives     fifth it gives a fresh breath of air to character tropes that are rarely used today and actually makes them wellwritten jack horner is a very good example of that because he is a psychopath who is beyond redeeming and chooses to be evil and blunt with his motives instead of relying on a tragic backstory to back him up that my friend is how you make a good unapologetically evil villain no relatable no tragedy just a fun but psychotic villain     and finally the voice acting i love how dreamworks actually doesnt rely on famous people to boost their film but rather on them boosting it on honest work and good writing like any decent movie should do the voice actorsactresses all did an amazing job in delivering the right presence into each character only seen through concept work and that my friends is difficult to achieve so a very big round of applause to them    so overall this film is amazing genius and very original and groundbreaking with its mix of animation but maturity and i hope dreamworks can continue making masterpieces such as this and that these guys are currently celebrating their victory at the box offices so parents kids and teens please watch this film it is gorgeous and so wellwritten i loved it so much and very much must you love it too d
Jan 23 2023,positive,this movie takes everything that was amazing in the bad guys and somehow makes it all better

Jan 23 2023,positive,death makes this movie
Jan 23 2023,positive,one of the best movies ive seen in a long time and maybe im biased because i struggle with my own mortality and death but it does talk about this topic in a way that not only reignited my own passion for life but also covered themes and topics i feel many people can resonate with in a way that is easy to digest and sit with the animation is beautiful something i hope dreamworks carries on for more cartoony movies in the coming years and is very colorful and atmospheric when it needs to be the bad guys all correspond with differing antagonist tropes in ways that feel seamless allowing them and their stories to not overlap in ways that feel forced not to mention we get to see the classic shrek2esque spin by taking known fairytales and giving them modern twists extremely excited to see where dreamworks goes from here and with el gato con botas
Jan 23 2023,positive,incredible eye candy animation combined with fun characters engaging plot and surprisingly adult themes this movie is amazing
Jan 23 2023,positive,the animation is just simply flawless and also the storyline
Jan 23 2023,positive,i absolutely loved the message the movie teach us
Jan 23 2023,positive,i just watched puss in boots in theatres and it was very good yall should give it a watch its very rare to have good movies that arent woke and make it absolutely hilarious with a beautiful moral meaning to it 
Jan 23 2023,positive,this is a must watch for anybody who loves movies with adventure fantasy great storytelling and that satirical dreamworks humor we know and love
Jan 23 2023,positive,the story was smooth and put together the animation style of the fighting scenes where my favorite parts the choppy look makes it look more intense
Jan 23 2023,positive,very fun story with a pretty thoughtful message about desires and mortality all wrapped in a nice visually stunning package
Jan 23 2023,positive,the characters were loveable and the overall animation and story were perfect my favorite character was death a great message that puss learns an excellent movie for the family
Jan 23 2023,positive,awesome the animation is incredible the characters are all well thought out and likeable the pacing is also great wonderful compelling story cant wait to see whats next for our favorite fearless hero puss in boots

Jan 23 2023,positive,fantastic movie i really liked the animation and the artstyle of it the designs and the personality of the characters where absolutely amazing and the story was also very good i recommend to watch
Jan 23 2023,positive,the movie its ok but there are certain scenes between the wolf and the cat that i think are too much for a little kid   every studio that produces films for kids should hire psychologists for analyzing the script so the children are exposed to the kind of content appropriate for their age
Jan 23 2023,positive,this was a really good movie out of all of the dreamworks animation movies that ive seen this one is my favorite the story is probably a 4 out of 5 to be honest its great but not amazing what really sold me on this movie as being one of my favorites was some of the animation styles that were being used and the dialogue of the characters during action sequences the animation style seems to have a reduced frames per second that is just visually really stunning just a beautiful movie the dialogue is on par with those of other dreamworks movies but this movie was just outstanding when you consider the dialogue just a great movie
Jan 23 2023,positive,an amazing fun melodramatic and spontaneous heist
Jan 23 2023,positive,great fun typical pnb
Jan 23 2023,positive,this movie has quite a lot of good qualities namely the plot the characters the story the humour the visuals oh wait that sounds like everything heh well yes there isnt anything that this movie lacks highly reccomend it to everyone children and adults alike its got great humour both for adults and kids life lessons that hit hard as a cliff and is in my opinion the best movie of the past year

Jan 23 2023,positive,i like the way they build the plot and character
Jan 23 2023,positive,this movie was amazing i love the story themes and my god the animation this had a good story with great themes on mortality and found family and the animation i love the 2d and 3d blend and the inspiration from popular media like anime spiderverse and sergio leone i love the character of death and that whistle is bone chilling i am pleasantly surprised that the whistle wasnt a dies irae derivative and i kind of like that this movie is great for all ages and reaffirms that animation is a medium and not a genre also the wolf is hot idk
Jan 22 2023,positive,good plot pacing a good wrap up for puss in boots while leaving the door open for more if needed
Jan 22 2023,positive,great movie i dont go out of my way to see animated movies and i actually enjoyed it the animation style had something unique about it that i havent noticed in others before

Jan 22 2023,positive,great movie beautiful message and fantastic balance of humor action and feel good movie
Jan 22 2023,positive,what could have easily been a turd was polished incredibly well i say this because last shrek movies including 2011 puss in boots was mediocre the directors and writers havent had many successes in the past either however this movie demonstrates when a team can come together and see a finish line and genuinely produce something of superb quality this is a paradigm shift i hope to see if their future films
Jan 22 2023,positive,great pacing and lots of fun for the whole family  actually got my 4 yr old to sit through a whole movie
Jan 22 2023,positive,great movie loved the art style
Jan 22 2023,negative,very cringe the only thing about the movie was death 
Jan 22 2023,positive,i watched this because people were praising the villain and they were right it wasnt just the villain though every part of this movie was great
Jan 22 2023,positive,puss in boots so coo cool  perrito got me dizzy 
Jan 22 2023,positive,okay i understand a few of these mad parents but there honestly is hardly any violence that is considered pg13 the art style is better than arcane what is wrong with yall

Jan 22 2023,positive,puss in boots the last wish blows avatar out of the water and its only an hour long   i can not stress enough how much you need to see this movie worth buying tickets       our favorite fearless hero puss pathetic meow meow affectionate is battling the horrors with his besties  the animation if beautiful its attack on titan for kids its terrifying in the best way possible and its hilarious great for all ages   i cant believe dreamworks has made me excited for shrek 5 watch this movie
Jan 22 2023,positive,great movie with lots of comedic moments  loved the references to fairy tales
Jan 22 2023,positive,very pleasurable movie
Jan 22 2023,positive,this movie is an absolute masterpiece   like i aint gon lie   however the movie perfectly contains sum form of social critisism in the beginning we can see puss going to that ol lady and living a normal live where the lady and the house represent current society and its function to keep its ppl safe as it is also somehow shown in hobbes social contract more over it shows that living autonomous life means to know oneself and take on burdens n stuff so we see on that lil map that everyone has to go a diff path since everyone has to live their own lifes the way it beneftits themselves the most but what i think makes the movie special is that ur not alone on youre path and that your path is not always seperate from the others but that there is lots of intersections   what i find most interesting about the paths is the goal of it youre said to be granted a wish if u finish ur path however what i think the movie ist trying to say is that wishesshort cuts are for lil pussies the goal of the path is not ur goal but to find your meaning the goal of the path is in a sense the beginning of your life wich can also be seen in puss path theres a stop where hes trapped in that lil hole an with his past lifes and the death the station is calles lost souls or smth u can think that it only means lost lifes or smth but i think what the movie is trying to say is that unless you find your own goal in lifereach the goal of the map path thing ur lost this is seen by the introduction of death he said something like puss was hiding from death in more life from running away ur basically lost since your life has no meaning therefore the goal of this path is to find urselfe and your goal what u want thats why that girl and her bear family had to visit a replica of their old home   what fascinates me about that scene is that the map says to look forwardbut looking forward shows ur past meaning that to be able to take steps in life u have to know where u came from and who u are thats sum crazy stuff ngl   lastly i wanna finish of with the death obviously the coolest character in the film since he got cool swords and a badass design however he is not a acting character in the film hes just the visualisation of the death so he doesnt kill but jus is there to show that death is there if you know what i mean   hes the character that said that puss was hiding in life what i find cool about him is not the usual talk that u can only worth ur life when u know death this film is greater than that it is trying to close the binary between life and deaht it is trying to show us the hierarchy that weve created that life  death but dont understand that both live from one another  so its not that life n death are two different things but that life inherits death and death life in the sense that stuffs kinda mixed up life isnt just the absence of death but death is the thing that makes life worth oh wow ok it is the typical stuff but i gotta say that the way it was portrayed was super cool or maybe it is different when i watched the film i remember that i understood it differently im sorry im a lil tired   to sum up films great 1010
Jan 22 2023,positive,3 generations went together it was just enough kid fun and grown up comedy to keep us all entertained
Jan 22 2023,positive,im a parent that went with my family consisting of kids ages 14 10  5 there are some scenes that may be too scary for younger onesheck even i was a little frightened at some of the dark elements death comes for puss and does so in a dark and dramatic way overall it was a good movie for this 40 year old incorporating nursery rhyme stories in a creative way puss does say one curse word
Jan 22 2023,positive,the best animated movie since spiderman into the spiderverse emotional beautiful action packed its the best kind of sequel the shrek 2 the empire strikes back kind of sequel

Jan 22 2023,positive,as someone who deals with anxiety every day this movie didnt just hit home with me it dragged me into my bedroom and beat the living soul out of me the animation is stunning and the art style is somehow better than the dreamworks movies before it the story has an excellent execution with a hilarious main villain and a terrifying force of nature thats the very symbol of death the main cast are enjoyable to watch as they make their way through the plot one of the characters was surprisingly enjoyable since they first seem like theyd be an annoying comedy relief only to be one of the best characters    overall im going to watch this as many times as ive seen shrek and shrek ii with just how good this movie is this is the second best sequel dreamworks has ever produced
Jan 22 2023,positive,best villain of all time and also the best animated movie since intro the spiderverse its up there with all the other dreamworks masterpieces such as httyd and the last guardians
Jan 22 2023,positive,hilarious but serious when it needed to be serious i didnt watch the original puss in boots and ive forgotten the plots of the shrek sequels but it was enjoyable and not confusing at all you could take your kids to see this without having to rent the entire shrek franchise for them beforehand i like how the animation was more cartoony stepping away from the uncannily realistic style of past shrek movies the voice acting was also great every character has a pretty distinct accent but not to the point where it feels mocking or grating and the celebrity voice actors dont feel like theyre just there to pull in a bigger audience the theme of the movie that we cant escape from death but shouldnt spend every moment fearing it is something i needed when i was younger too many family movies are afraid to talk about death so i enjoy the recent trend in animation where this topic is thoroughly addressed instead of avoided overall a great movie made with heart and a sequel that isnt a soulless cash grab
Jan 22 2023,positive,enjoyed the movie it was funny and both kid friendly
Jan 22 2023,positive,it was really good and death was just a top tier villain
Jan 22 2023,positive,i was pretty hesitant at first to watch the movie only because i didnt really care about puss in boots character but after seeing reviews about the movie me and my girlfriend said screw it lets watch it i dont know where to even begin or summarize how i felt about the movie but it was amazing from start to finish i was hooked from the villian to the character development to the plot everything was just so fresh and spot on i never wrote a movie review this is actually my first but i just had to review it and rate it definitely one of my favorite animation movies of all time this is coming from a person that usually falls asleep halfway into movies i was fully awake for every scene from start to finish a definite must watch
Jan 22 2023,positive,i pirated this movie and found it so good that i made a rotten tomatoes account purely to give something back to this absolute gem of a film enough said really
Jan 22 2023,positive,genuinely one of the best movies i have ever watched loved every second of this film the music was amazing it was really funny it makes you feel for characters it and the animation is amazing and all the characters are awesome highly recommend seeing this movie if you havent already to see your favorite fearless hero puss in boots
Jan 22 2023,positive,as an incredibly stressed out college student i was hesitant to go to a late night showing of this movie with my roommate but i have been obsessed ever since i bought it to watch at home and have watched it every day since just in the background cute cat running from death and 3 cute bears  happy college kid idk how to write reviews but i adore this movie
Jan 22 2023,positive,this movie was brilliant as far as villains go the big bad wolf is probably going to be considered one of the most iconic dreamworks has ever created
Jan 22 2023,positive,the kids loved the movie but were we watched it was not the best yet it was still a great movie
Jan 22 2023,positive,took my 8 year old grandson to puss in boots he loved it and said it was amazing i loved the message and the moral of the story
Jan 22 2023,positive,didnt like the main bad guy but overall it was great
Jan 22 2023,positive,it was cute witty and the animation was excellent  a possible downside may be that you might have to be of a certain age to get all the references
Jan 22 2023,positive,there was no dull moments in this movie it kept me wanting to watch all the way through
Jan 22 2023,positive,fresh and fun  we loved it 
Jan 22 2023,positive,it was fun and entertaining
Jan 22 2023,positive,surprisingly delightful entry in the franchise thanks to a superb vocal cast rich story and gorgeous animation  antonio banderas remains superb in the title role this time giving a rich performance as puss is now in fear of death despite years of heroics  he is matched by the rest of the cast particularly selma hayek at kitty softpaws and florence pugh as goldilocks  behind the camera directors joel crawford and januel mercado direct a rich story dealing with death and what it means to live  they also use the allegory of a wish effectively showing how all those seeking it already have what they want already if they would just look for it  it is matched by some gorgeous animation blending cgi with 2d in a brilliant way making for some fantastic action and set pieces  all in all a fantastic film and one of the best of 2022
Jan 22 2023,positive,easily the best animated movie of the year the story  is surprisingly mature with puss struggling with his  mortality and its not shying away from shocking scenes or heartwrenhing moments the animation is stellar spiderverses influence on modern animation is nothing other than magical plus the movie is really funny just like you would want it it from a shrek movie id say this is the best movie in the shrek saga since shrek 2 and i cant wait for more of the franchise in the future
Jan 22 2023,positive,it was perfect perfect down to the last minute detailshomelander
Jan 22 2023,positive,here it is the masterpiece ive been waiting for the last few years finally someone reminded the giant studios how movies are made the animation is incredible dreamworks decided to change the style of the cartoon for the better and they succeeded the comic book style of spiderman spiderman into the spiderverse and a bit of anime animation wink at the cat the cartoon has enough morals so you will have a lot to think about after watching it and the main antagonist is one of the best antagonists in cartoons in general his movements look and charisma make you scared the sequel does not depend on the events of the first part and the series of shrek cartoons it tells a new story on its own about a wellknown fairytale character who having spent his 8 lives is afraid to lose his last one running away from death itself visually the cartoon is bright and fabulous it was very unexpected that the director of the failed projects trolls and the croods a new era joel crawford was able to make this masterpiece and wipe disneys nose so i recommend it to everyone
Jan 22 2023,positive,just saw this movie yesterday with my friend and its awesome everything from the writing to the visuals to the voice acting was great and you could tell the movie had a lot of heart put into it i highly recommend this movie to everyone but would also like to point out that if youre a parent trying to find a fun movie to watch with your kids this is def the movie to pick its written really well overall and got a lot of jokes that adults will like too while still being appropriate for children ofc its honestly probably one of the best kids movies ive seen in a while so yea
Jan 22 2023,positive,havent seen an animated movie i wanna watch again the day after since i was a kid    how dreamworks cross old fairtales in such ways with modern takes along with references and details to other figures or movies makes it only more interesting to look around to see whats going on in the background as well    great for all ages
Jan 22 2023,positive,really sweet and hilarious
Jan 22 2023,positive,perfectionthe voice acting  animation  characters and character devolepment was insane but best of all the villians and especially death  and i dont mean it metaphorically or rhetorically or poetically or theoretically or any other fancy way  death straight up    but no im being for real here this movie is a 1010
Jan 22 2023,positive,the previous pib movie was kinda boring for me but this lastest one must be one of the greatest movies of dreamworks

Jan 22 2023,positive,im 19 years old going on 20 i went to go see this film with my mother and my sister with her 3 year old son who loves puss in boots i am pretty sure i was much more interested and invested into this movie than my nephew     it was actually really good i do still like animated content such as arcane invincible into the spiderverse etc as well as things youd consider for a kid like kung fu panda i love those movies and puss in boots the last wish really takes it home
Jan 22 2023,positive,one of the cinematic masterpieces by dreamworks great character development for puss immersive action scenes magnificent camerawork justabsolute chefs kiss character design is goddamn the illustrations are so good too i just damn    my absolute favourite part of the movie was when puss had a disagreement with his past souls you can see his distinctive personality change hes still puss but wiser also should i elaborate on how much i love the wolf hes such a remarkable character amongst all dreamworks characters there are multiple messages conveyed plus the executions on the delivery are subtle and just right there are some predictable cliche tropesplots at some turns but they are done just right as well by dreamworks tbh im fine with it i also love how dreamworks started to produce such gorgeous movies ever since the phenomenal spiderman into the spiderverse all in all im looking forward to more great movies by dreamworks
Jan 22 2023,positive,great movie just didnt know the seat would be so close together did not like that at all

Jan 21 2023,positive,if you love animated movies  this is a must see  the different styles and techniques play out beautifully and although a bit of a cliche in storytelling for adventure  quest movie it was still a well spent 100 or so minutes
Jan 21 2023,positive,the best 2023 annimated movie so far with a great story and narrative the characters just went amazing just like the graphic annimation itself i really like the way this movie has adults and childrens as main targetnot changing the insence of the characters and making amazing new ones  thats what leades a movie to success i highly recomend to watch
Jan 21 2023,positive,all i can say is wow the ending was amazing it leaves you knowing that the story continues     i was a little worried given the last shrek movies being subpar while the first puss in boots was great     so after seeing this dreamworks definitely did a great job
Jan 21 2023,positive,a great movie to watch with family and friends
Jan 21 2023,positive,i dont think what i say will do justice to how good this movie is its a film that children can enjoy and adults can cry literally the best movie i saw in my whole life this is one of those movies that will be seen 50 years after its release and who watch it will think its a wonderful movie its an instant classic that everyone should watch at least once in their life oh and just one thing if you havent watched it yet try to avoid spoilers and stop reading these commentaries about the movie even if you dont care about spoilers just trust me and go watch it right now

Jan 21 2023,positive,great movie my 9 and 16 year old loved it love the ending
Jan 21 2023,positive,never have i seen a movie portray anxiety and fear in such a realistic and immersive way as a 17 year old who struggles with anxiety i must say it resonated with me in a way i was not expecting it far surpassed my expectations for both a kids and an illumination movie could not recommend it more   i find that it suits both children and adults we all struggle with something and this movie helps validate that though very young children may not be able to understand the main message side note the new animation is great the colours blend so beautifully and everything feels more cartoony and exciting
Jan 21 2023,positive,the sequel turned out to be the same as puss in boots risky but able to win success this is one of the best animation sequels of all time everything is perfectly calibrated in it from the absence of plot holes or their explanation to the disclosure of characters graphics sound design i really liked that all the references are unobtrusive except of course the scene after the ending but it was made that way on purpose 1010 absolutely nothing to complain about this kind of event rarely happens
Jan 21 2023,positive,best animated movie ive seen in a long long time and thats coming from a diehard disney fan we brought my daughter for her 6th birthday and she couldnt stop giggling talking about it and saying it was the best day ever i agree the movie really did a fantastic job and moved me to tears multiple times nothing cheap or too easy in terms of jokes and i liked the pop culture easter eggs too
Jan 21 2023,positive,over all i think it was really good a great movie for kids and adults alike
Jan 21 2023,positive,loved it good storyline
Jan 21 2023,positive,the best villain in the entire animation  world i love it so much   w dreamworks

Jan 21 2023,positive,the entire story from start to finish was great from character development to the journey of each character was great highly recommend anyone to watch it
Jan 21 2023,positive,surprisingly very good as both a sequel to the first film and the franchise funny and yet very mature so that both kids and adults alike will understand 100 recommend for the whole family to watch and enjoy
Jan 21 2023,positive,a spectacular and funny movie with beautiful art style
Jan 21 2023,positive,the story got a bit confusing and the adventure was mixed up in my head but it was nice to see all of these characters battle and death death is awesome every time i hear his whistle i just want to yell out hes here and then scream
Jan 21 2023,positive,dreamworks knows how to make a movie and sequels this movie had a lot of reallife meanings and for adults a lot of can actually relate to this movie on the surface its a great movie of course for kids below the surface its a great life lesson all packed in 1 hour and a half
Jan 21 2023,positive,best movie in the shrek universe and best villain too   what a great movie
Jan 21 2023,positive,what a wonderful movie it was a delight to watch it was fun and a visual spectacle  throughout the movie banderos and hayek were perfect voices for the main characters all the voice actors were good if you want to watch a movie that is clean of woke and adult content this is the movie for you there are very few movies that keep me smiling from beginning to end enjoy
Jan 21 2023,positive,god i love the movie so much i must say the whistlening kinda scared me
Jan 21 2023,positive,very cute movie with a message it was funny too
Jan 21 2023,positive,the animation is such high quality and death is the greatest villain of all time for kids movie 100 must see
Jan 21 2023,positive,beat animarían movie of the year and in general one of the beat movies of the year it is an awesome experience for kids and adults with a great story and good character development
Jan 21 2023,positive,this movie is top tier dreamworks easily the 2nd best movie in the shrek franchise    the comedy action and animation style are what sets this movie apart from any other average babysitting movie    impressively there are some moments of real dread and the build of of suspense is done very well     an amazing cast really helps here too nobody is phoning it in very good performances from antonio banderas and salma hayek
Jan 21 2023,positive,as the movie has relied heavily on wordofmouth i went into the theatre expecting a lot puss in boots the last wish delivered above and beyond my expectations with its trademark selfaware humor dating from the shrek franchise that has kept up with the times   however what makes the movie a stellar contribution to cinema is the way it was able to through its surprisingly imperfect hero communicate mental health topics to viewers of all ages and in a 102minute format present a character arc of a depth and significance somewhere between zuko atla and wolverine logan  an amazing achievement at reviving and modernizing a beloved franchise by dreamworks and an absolute mustsee
Jan 21 2023,positive,i remember watching the first one and totally forgot what it was about by the time this movie came out didnt have any high expectations at first and wow was i in for a surprise this film is my alltop favorite of 2022 the animation the story the characters nothing seemed shoehorned here even the spanish lines which i have little knowledge of  didnt detract from my experience but rather added to it this is a spanishbased fairytale so it makes sense for me the main villain in this film is the protagonist himself puss own arrogance catches the attention of our supposed villain death disguised as the big bad wolf who gives puss a boot of reality and makes him realize that he squandered his past 8 lives the film does a great job of evoking fear every time death appears on screen the movie also tends to very effectively tug at your heartstrings here and there one such moment is towards the end when baby bear thanks his sister goldilocks for saving his life and afterwards when they all give a heartwarming family hug my favorite character has to be perrito he isnt exactly your average comicrelief as the film superbly depicts him as a supportive sidekick hes an extremely likable character great great film overall i hope this does well in the box office because i would certainly like to see more subsequent films in this series
Jan 21 2023,positive,i thought the movie would be cashgrab or bad at first but i underestimated it by so many levels the story the characters and themesmorals were exellently executed    the main characters felt alive to me but puss extreme fears of death felt absolutely real and perfectly captures the main themes of this movie mortality and death stating that death and mortality is something no one can ever escape from but living to fullest and cherishing every moment in life will be worth it    not just that but talk about the animation style heavily inspired by spiderman into the spiderverse 2018 but made into something of their own super awsome super dynamic and very cartoony    one of the best movie to emerge from 2022 highrecommendation
Jan 21 2023,positive,best movie in the shrek universe in my opinion i expected this movie to be awesome because the first one was awesome and it was 10 times better than my expectations
Jan 21 2023,positive,it has great visuals a great story super great character development i love it
Jan 21 2023,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed puss in boots the last stand the animation was topnotch and the characters were likable and welldeveloped the story was engaging and kept me on the edge of my seat the humor was spoton and had me laughing out loud overall a great addition to the puss in boots franchise highly recommend it
Jan 21 2023,positive,youre laughing and then youre crying and then youre laughing favorite movie ever
Jan 21 2023,positive,im going to rate 5 stars because i love shrek and puss in boots however 1 this movie was a bit drawn out and 2 definitely more catered for kids versus shrek adults who come back for the more adult jokes and themes which this movie lacked very cute movie though overall i just probably would not watch again
Jan 21 2023,positive,amazing love it so much
Jan 21 2023,positive,its really good i recommend it
Jan 21 2023,positive,this movie is super good like really good i love when these sort of kids movies  show respect to there audience witch they dont really do anymore this movie has reminded me of why i fell in love with the shrek franchise      this movie teaches kids about death and how its not a joke and to live your life with your friends and family this movie is full of character development from puss being a cocky hero who doesnt fear anything to a hero who learned that life is not a toy this movie is really good for kids to watch and learn about life and death and to respect it    going into the theater i was expecting a fun movie i knew it was going to be good but not as good as it was i genuinely watched this movie like 5 times scene i first saw it in theaters over 2 weeks ago     this movie is really funny im a person who likes dark humor and this movie was full of it and im just glad this movie exists     the only reason this movie isnt a 5 out of 5 is because i think the movies passing was to fast and i wish it was longer i dont advise bringing like 6 year olds younger to go because this movie can be scary at times
Jan 21 2023,negative,they tried too hard for laughs the story felt all over the place
Jan 21 2023,negative,the movie was horrible overrated for the other reviews and corny ash rushed story line and weird ending how can the bad guy want to kill the protagonist and just stop seconds before killing him and say hes a cool dude doesnt add up weird movie wasted 2 hours and about 25
Jan 21 2023,positive,so funny  enjoyable for bigger kids and parents  might be too scary for kids ages 7  under
Jan 21 2023,positive,the boys loved it especially the graphics
Jan 21 2023,positive,the movie is fun and emotion get to watch with the family the main theme of the movie is everything is just right in the beginning of the movie puss says that he doesnt fear death but he does when he was on his last life at the end he found that he just needs have the things that love and appreciate and live to the fullest  i heard that the movie related to people overall the movie is great and heart worming
Jan 21 2023,positive,all of it great story

Jan 20 2023,positive,it definitely has touched my heart love the ending
Jan 20 2023,positive,i went in watching this not with low expectations but i thought it would be an average animated movie     but my lord this movie was good literally perfect and the new art style in this sequel is so refreshing modern but keeps the nostalgia i get from dream works movies    1010
Jan 20 2023,positive,i really enjoyed my experience at this movie for those of us growing up with the franchise i feel like this spoke to some very critical mental health themes with class the world was fleshed out and the character development was sincere i was surprised by how much i loved this movie 
Jan 20 2023,positive,cute movie grandkids loved it
Jan 20 2023,positive,i watched this movie based on the incredible response it got online and while this movie is definitely a good kids movie i have heard that it is also a movie adults could appreciate yes the main villain was interesting and i put quotes there because even though he was technically the main villain he had much less screen time than other characters who were also villains was fun to watch he wasnt in the movie a lot as a kids movie though it is very good and im sure kids will love it anyone trying to compare to other movies that border adultkids animation i would say is good but i would wait for it to go online to watch
Jan 20 2023,positive,the animation was fantastic the villain death was great hes not really a villain a death is a force of naturethe only reason why death came for puss in boots was to teach him humilitypuss in boots teaches us that no matter how much of a big shot you think you are theres always going to be someone or something above you
Jan 20 2023,positive,fun story about second chances and friendship
Jan 20 2023,positive,beautiful story brought together teaching a variety of life lessons worth the watch
Jan 20 2023,positive,its honestly one of the best movies ive ever watched i love how all the characters have an actual personality and their different traits are portrayed so well the animation style is very fitting i liked to see the fearless hero who laughs at death make the realization that they arent immortal something about this movie just had such a strange affect on me a positive one
Jan 20 2023,positive,i thought the first movie was meh okay so i was expecting a funyetmediocre sequel that hopefully wasnt too cringy my mistake this is one of those movies where the sequel is so much better than the original and i loved everything about it the updated animation style is awesome the characters are all endearing and interesting even the ones i thought would be annoying turned out to be great the story is engaging and well written  and can i just say both villains in this movie are incredible a movie about heroes needs good villains and where so many recent movies have failed this movie succeeds big time     i was a bit nervous when i realized they were starting to follow the marvel formula of chase the glowything  but i ended up loving the concept of the star map and the deeper meaning it had towards revealing character motivations without every little thing having to be spelled out in an exposition dump simply brilliant storytelling     animation continues to be one of my favorite mediums for storytelling maybe because it always feels more thought out maybe because the blend of humor heart and action is more seamless in animation puss in boots the last wish truly stands out as spectacular and i highly recommend it
Jan 20 2023,positive,elite animated movie for all ages
Jan 20 2023,positive,amazing animation style
Jan 20 2023,positive,this is such a great movie movie with such good qualities like  great animation and sometimes animates on two for the style  amazing story and had me chuckling throughout  the amazing characters that look way better and i love the new characters   summary  this is a absolute must watch for anyone even for teens and adults
Jan 20 2023,positive,the film is a representation that with the past of time follows the most faithful of all films the passing of time showing that not everything is fantasy rather the adventure of the reality of our lives and transcendence
Jan 20 2023,positive,absolutely loved it the main villain was so terrifying to the point it didnt feel like a dreamworks movie im also surprised that an animated movie like this would involve topics such as anxiety and death i would love to rewatch this movie again
Jan 20 2023,positive,it was very funny silly yet enduring absolute slapper of a film
Jan 20 2023,positive,so beautiful movie with nice messages of friendship i love it   i recommend 100 beautiful is spanish sounds excellent
Jan 20 2023,positive,this movie has some of the best writing voice acting animation and story structure ive seen in a long time a must see
Jan 20 2023,positive,visually a very beautiful movie i really enjoyed the punchy action sequences as well they dropped the frame rate for some of puss battles and it makes for a very comicbook feel like into the spiderverse    the story had a good balance between cute fairytale whimsy and stakes that felt real i think this movie did a much better job than most other childrens movies with themes about death trust and the idea that love is what makes life worth living the characters were also very welldone and i enjoyed the introduction of several new characters which were really new faces put to old characters     honestly i would love to see dreamworks make more fairytale spinoffs i dont say this lightly puss in boots the last wish has restored my trust with their ability to make the next shrek an enjoyable story
Jan 20 2023,positive,marvelous movie amazing development values script i see no flaws in this movie it was perfect
Jan 20 2023,positive,very enjoyable movie  sat down with the family and the kids loved it
Jan 20 2023,positive,when i saw there was a sequel released to puss in boots i didnt think much of it just like many other people i assume at least man was this movie a huge surprise and honestly a fantastic expierence the first is the visuals wich are obviously fantastic with inspirations from spider verse and a continuation of what bad guys first looked like the colors pop and puss looks better than ever before the story is mainly about how puss has selfishly gone trough 8 of hes 9 lifes how clever honesly and now puss must take good care of his last live this makes for a great foundation for character growth and boy does he get trough that mainly with the help of death yes the litteral characterisation of the death who is a wolf who follows puss around making him nervous and anxious everytime he does hes signiture wistle with other fairytales and nursery rhymes like goldilocks and the three bears and the main villian jack horner everyone wants to have a map that leads to one wish wich can be whatever you want we also see the return of kitty softpaws who also get more development than ever with the two main characters and the addition of perrito wich is a lovely way to optimistic dog serving as a great friend and character they all fight for that last wish i wont spoil the ending but that might geniunely be one of the best endings ever to a film this is a great movie that talks about important topics such a trauma trust issues and the realisation you also one day will die and that that thought is okay to have sometimes a movie that has so little wrong that i cannot think of a single thing that geniunely bothered me or limited the expierence truly a near perfect movie and that is insane to think about but i am really happy that it is
Jan 20 2023,positive,i just saw the puss in boots movie and absolutely loved it the animation visuals soundtrack themes and story just perfectly coincided with each other and was just chef kisses didnt expect them to have a little teaser at the end so cant wait for what they have in store next solid 55 stars
Jan 20 2023,positive,this is a fantastic movie i would give it a 99 rotten tomatoes as the animation style is the best i have in a few years i would say it is on the levels of shrek 2 and death is the best villain of all time even darth vader does not come close sorry that was a tangent anyways i really love the way that they did not kill death oof as they realized this potential i really love the character of the charming team friendship and i also loved the ending for the 3 bears and goldilocks the last wish map and the idea is also very innovative from what i know i personally and in my opinion the best animated film of 2022
Jan 20 2023,positive,beautiful animations characters charisma and heartwarming story it makes you reflect on your happiness problems and the way you deal with it i highly recommend
Jan 20 2023,positive,such an enjoyable movie never a dull moment for me i enjoyed the first movie but this one really went above and beyond

Jan 20 2023,positive,amazing movie with beautiful visuals and a really nice story
Jan 20 2023,positive,puss in boots the last wish covers dark topics like death and heartbreak but the animation comedy and characters make it possibly the silliest and the best movie in the shrek franchise
Jan 20 2023,positive,i cried during puss in boots the last wish twice beautiful art direction and wonderful characters
Jan 20 2023,positive,i honestly think that as of 2023 this is the best movie in the shrek franchise everything about it is phenomenal and id honestly say its a perfect movie i may even prefer this entry over shrek 2  its that good    every character is a delight and the animation is like eyecandy but more important than that is the story its awesome to see puss go through such a character arc tackling themes of his mortality and purpose seeing him grow even as the seasoned adventurer he is he feels like hes reached an end yet despite it all finds a new beginning and accepts change    in the words of goldilocks herself everything is just right
Jan 20 2023,negative,unfortunately this was a horrible movie  it was rated pg so i thought it would be ok for my kids i didnt really see any witch craft just a magic star story   then i was surprised by the language the bleeping out of words making it normal for kids to hear then the violence that my kids had to turn away from from an animated movie for crying out loud then i spotted a scene from when they looked at the map i shouldnt had been surprised but there was the all seeing eye placed on the map goodness i refuse to allow my kids to be desensitized  what should had been an innocent pg movie turned to me having to keep explaining to my kids that the world just tries to see how far they can move the line which is why we have to protect our eye and ear gates
Jan 20 2023,positive,puss in boots the last wish was hilarious and very heartwarming such a good movie with some mild language but still a good movie
Jan 20 2023,positive,i had heard a bunch of good things about this movie and boy were they right the animation alone is gorgeous but the music and story is all top notch dreamworks didnt hold back either showing actual blood and rolling with a much darker theme definitely wouldnt recommend for young children but maybe 8 and up all around it was a fantastic movie super glad i saw it
Jan 20 2023,positive,im 30 years old and ive been to see this three times in my local theater 1010 they nailed everything tears were shed and many genuine laughs were shared the casting was spot on and we are once again reminded of the magic that dreamworks can produce bravo

Jan 19 2023,positive,fantastically beautiful and shockingly emotional dreamworks takes their audience and movies seriously as seen with puss in boots the last wish they do not stray from dark subject matter and it makes for a refreshing touching and at times unsettling movie
Jan 19 2023,positive,i have nothing but good things to say about this film beautiful animation amazing voice work and a phenomenal villain an excellent film
Jan 19 2023,positive,i havent been so emotionally wrecked by a movie a heart wrenching experience too good

Jan 19 2023,positive,yes its worth the hype
Jan 19 2023,positive,i went to see puss in boots the last wish with my fiancé and was expecting an average family movie but i what i got was a beautifully animated film with amazing characters and themes the movie tackles the heavy topic of death in a way that is appropriate and relatable for people of all ages and walks of life my favorite parts of the movie were the antagonists specifically how they use three different villain types without any of them clashing even as an adult the wolf antagonist gave me chills the relatable villain had an amazing redemption arc as part of the movies b plot i could say plenty more about puss character development but ill leave that to the movie itself this movie is a must see
Jan 19 2023,positive,this was probably the most fire movie of 2023 so far dreamworks has outdone itself once again by creating a movie with an awesome antagonist and protagonist 1010 movie and i highly recommend watching it to the very end for an amazing surprise
Jan 19 2023,positive,i decided to watch the movie only after seeing the reviews because before seeing what people said about the movie i watched the other films of the shrek universe and i didnt dislike it but it was so long ago i forgot almost everything i honestly kinda forgot the film existed and im glad i stumbled upon a review on youtube because i probably wouldnt have watched it if it werent for this it was amazing i dont want to spoil anything but the movie has some supprisingly mature themes and depicts fear in a way that felt real
Jan 19 2023,positive,funny and poignant at the same time great animation i did not think i was going to like it but everyone did a great ob in it
Jan 19 2023,positive,incredible in every way
Jan 19 2023,positive,the story every character was amazing and i feel healed after watching this movie it has all the emotions in it  i like it and will watch it again
Jan 19 2023,positive,best movie i have ever watched
Jan 19 2023,positive,this is one of the best movies ive ever seen and i just want you to know if you havent watched this film yet do it you wont regret it 1010 masterpiece the animation is flawless and reminds me a lot of spiderverse with some characters having smooth movement while the others have a slower fps the battle scenes are really good and have a charm to them that if theres a battle scene you know your gonna enjoy it  now there are spoilers in this last section so leave if you havent watched the movie yet the characters are great and so is the character development puss going from a fearless badass that laughs in the face of death to someone who is deeply scared of dying and losing his friends now im gonna get this out of the way death is an amazing character cuz he is always at the back of your mind like what is that really scary death wolf that wants to murder puss doing right now while they fight or just talk but there are thoose small reminders that yes the plot should be moving yes the plot is important yes puss needs to hurry before he dies and theese reminders come in the little whistle of death while he appears somewhere either behind or somewhere near puss death really puts some emotional connection with puss and even the audience always fearing him the fact that puss bleeds in the first interaction with death sets the boundaries of the film going forwards like it isnt this is a kid friendly cute chirldrens film to we arent scared of doing anything and you cant except the obvious 1010 film i dont usually do reviews but dang this movie is really fucking good go watch it now
Jan 19 2023,positive,i came into the movie theater expecting a decently good and entertaining movie but instead i got a fantastic film with such superb animation and storytelling this film is everything you might want from the heartfelt message to the lowkey terrifying encounters with the antagonist ive nothing but good things to say about this film    go watch it
Jan 19 2023,positive,everything about this movie was 10010 go see it right now great animation the cast was amazing the plot was amazing and it wrapped up every story arc nicely the dialogue was on point and the character designs were all so good i cannot recommend this movie enough

Jan 19 2023,positive,pinnacle of animated kids movies might get a little dark at times but honestly really enjoyable in my opinion perfect storytelling and plot timeline contains a wide variety of moral values to learn with emphasis on bravery and the initiative to do something for yourself as well as living your life to the fullest definitely recommend
Jan 19 2023,positive,best movie probably in the last 5 years a refreshing glimpse into how people used to make 21st century art its like someone gave a team from the 90s to early 2000s todays technology and told them to go wild we should have been getting movies like this for the past two decades but unfortunately all art has been politically subverted during that time making for piles of badly written movies with forgettable or no fleshed out characters
Jan 19 2023,positive,as an animator the animation was incredible the characters were interesting and their stories were told in a way that wouldnt let you even take your eyes from the screen for a second death as a character was one of the best villains ive ever seen and i think its a movie both adults and children can enjoy as i watched it with my little brother who is m 13 and i am f 24 and we both called it one of our best movie nights ever

Jan 18 2023,positive,such a good family movie the adult jokes it has sprinkled in it just made it ten times better i love perrito and i hope everyone loves him like i do although his story is very sad he looks at the bright side of things and it brings a big lesson to children i also like the real topics that puss in boots touches on like anxiety that puss has when he hears the eerie whistle

Jan 18 2023,positive,animation was amazing and also the angel shots
Jan 18 2023,positive,handling its themes maturely without feeling overtly edgy mainly just tastefully done if you will yes i am indeed talking about the sequel to a spinoff of one of the mostmemed movie franchise in pop culture the dog sidekick felt like he might get annoying but seems to be the best take on the naïve sidekick in a film like this in a while and the wolf antagonist if your kids are easily frightened by a movie like caroline not too long ago maybe second guess bringing them but if they handled that well and enjoyed that film overall i encourage you to take them to see this puss in boots is the perfect flawed role model and what i said about handled maturely yes this movie has a message great for even the adults maybe even especially so
Jan 18 2023,positive,this movies a mustsee if you liked the first two shrek movies if youre really cool and have good taste it expertly embodies the spirit dreamworks had in its early days that made it special the movie puts entertaining spins on familiar stories similar to the takes on fairy tale characters in shrek as well as creating a memorable plotline with interesting characters that reminded me of kung fu pandas storytelling    the movies story is also surprisingly deeply mature it tackles subjects like anxiety and valuing life in a way thats both intellectual enough to carry thoughtful messages and emotional enough to connect audiences with the characters and make you care about them    there wasnt a single time in this movie where i regretted watching it or wished i was doing something else its fun thoughtprovoking and doesnt overstay its welcome
Jan 18 2023,positive,one of the best movies i seen in 2023 the story was well written voice acting was well acted and death was terrifying to even adults too

Jan 18 2023,positive,absolutely spectacular movie and a mustwatch the story animation characters and music all tied together so well and when the movie ended i stayed in my seat wanting more several scenes as well as sounds that whistle will haunt me for months to come were so memorable and puss in boots has made an outstanding legendary comeback watch the movie if you dare which you definitely should
Jan 18 2023,neutral,its nothing necessarily special or new it does what the next film in the shrek franchise should  its a movie that kids should enjoy that parents shouldnt exactly dread taking them to see it offers fun easter eggs and animation as well   fresh
Jan 18 2023,positive,this is one of the best movies i saw in recent years not just animationwise its brilliant bright touching it as wonderful takes on characters i didnt thought could have such an amazing twist a charismatic storytelling and some amazing portrayals i wish there could be more animation like this more cinemaworthy stories for everyone like this would and will absolutely recommend it to everyone i know from design to soundtrack its breathtaking i hope this becomes a must see classic for every family one day it sure has the material for it

Jan 18 2023,positive,animation is really good lots of funny moments and jokes all ages would laugh at the plot similar to many jokes can easily be understood by younger ages but also appreciated by older ages all the voice acting was very good except for that stupid dog perro the movie would easily be ranked higher if it wasnt for the voice acting of perro the pitch should of been higher and the tone could of been exaggerated better otherwise a solid movie

Jan 17 2023,positive,best thing to come out of the shrekiverse the film carried the same fairytale lore as all of the other films in the franchise but in a way that all made sense no one was placed in without having a roll in the progression of the movie where as the others threw as many fairytale characters as they could fit the animation style is enjoyable and fresh   the story was well written and had some meaning by the end of the film which made it enjoyable to watch with my kids
Jan 17 2023,positive,puss in boots is an animated story focused on young audience  however adults can relate to the struggles and dilemmas of puss making the movie a enjoyable treat to all audiences  definitely a must watch for all kids and adults who enjoy animations and comedies

Jan 17 2023,positive,i had no expectations going into this movie and there was no way i could have ever predicted the reality of it  incredible and unique animation aside the story and characters are deeply emotional and mature in a way that is wild for a puss in boots sequel in the best way  it is cinematic tense and heart wrenching and it is truly a perfect movie  i have seen it in theaters 3 times so far and each time was just as enthralling as the the first
Jan 17 2023,positive,this movie was truly one of the best experiences to see on big screen due to the amazing and beautiful animation and action choreography i was not expecting for there to be such strong emotional moments in this film along with lovable new characters the new wolf antagonist was such a showstealer despite the limited time he had on screen overall its a very good movie for all ages

Jan 16 2023,positive,this movie is absolutely amazing the new art style seems fresh and matches the movie very nicely  not only that but the characters themselves seem new and exciting with a more deep personality while maintaining what makes them unique and special  both the protagonists and antagonists are well developed and put together a show for the audience there are no characters who feel left out with each and every one of them having enough screen time to make you connect and like them even more  the humor and desperation are also mixed perfectly no jokes are made out of place and believe me the jokes in this movie will certainly make you laugh at least once and the rush of every character especially puss in boots while facing his main fear is transmitted to the audience flawlessly  definitely a 1010 and one of if not the best animated movie dreamworks has ever made

Jan 16 2023,positive,so very well done very detailed hilarious adventurous and cuteall around entertaining i will definitely be watching the next one
Jan 16 2023,positive,i love this movie i think it is very special and reminds the audience that kids movies dont have to be bland and full of nonsense for the sake of entertainement the animation is exiting and you can see that much love and thoughts went into this project how it should be in every movie i didnt expect to like it this much but it really stands out in comparison to the mainstream modern movies love the creativity 
Jan 16 2023,positive,great movie to see i totally recommend it i love it 
Jan 16 2023,positive,i would have never expected puss in boots of all things would end up being one of my favorite animated movies of all time the animation is gorgeous and while obviously inspired by into the spiderverse keeps its own style which fits the fairytale narrative death is a fantastic villain and the scenes with him have a complete tonal change hes such a fantastic villain the other villains are also great i love all of the characters and they all have some great arcs especially puss everything in this movie is amazing its an exhilarating thrillride that you never want to stop there is also swearing in this movie in a kids movie just amazed at the quality of the movie btw there are no actual fbombs or anything like that
Jan 16 2023,positive,great movie really enjoyed it with my family
Jan 16 2023,positive,now im definitely biased as i loved the adventures of puss in boots as a kid and watched it twice but this movie is so cool there are consistent themes of death you can even see him in the background of some scenes i love the art style its so bright and colorful and you can even see the paint strokes the story is heartwarming although i believe the scenes with death are anxiety inducing and could be scary for young children but i did love the references like death putting coins over the eyes like the ancient greeks i was surprised by some scenes like them going over each of puss deaths but i really liked it i think its a good movie that shows how animation isnt just for children and how adults can enjoy it as well i hope more movies like this come out in the future
Jan 16 2023,positive,great kids movie would recommend for your youngin
Jan 16 2023,positive,beautiful animation great voice acting and amazing story would recommend to any ages

Jan 16 2023,positive,oh i absolutely cried my eyes out at that one scene i rarely cry during movies and almost never sob in the cinema but i sure did for this movie anyways the art direction and animation had me gushing over every single scene the fights were so dynamic the character designs were so fun the themes and plot were woven together so well like sure the script was pretty simple and sometimes i think they didnt need to add dialogue in certain places but ultimately its a movie accessible to younger audiences and i think thats just great i really want to rewatch this asap because im starting to think it might become a comfort movie or even an alltime favorite

Jan 16 2023,positive,i dont give such high scores without truly meaning it that said puss in boots the last wish was absolutely phenomenal and i recommend this film to anyone who wants to be taken to the edge of their seats i did not expect anything more than a midlevel animated film to see with the kids its not that there are themes and elements that take place within the film that adults can surely relate to even if it is told in an entertaining way go see it you will not regret it

Jan 16 2023,positive,enjoyed every minute kids loved it

Jan 14 2023,positive,i made an account just to review this movie wow for a childrens movie this was incredibly good i think everyone should go and see this masterpiece of a film
Jan 14 2023,positive,dreamwork didnt need to go this hard for a sequel to a spinoff from over a decade ago but damn    the animation is stylistic vibrant and gorgeous with animation that is inspired by the spiderverse movies every frame is whacky and creative the story is also wonderfully done despite the short runtime it gives a very poignant and meaningful message to the audience what surprised me the most though was the action scenes those action scenes are choreographed so well    i dont like milking a franchise for over 20 years but this film gives me slight hope that the next entry might be worth watching
Jan 14 2023,positive,the whole movie was great

Jan 14 2023,positive,the graphics and story line were amazing1010  best animated movie ever for 2023
Jan 14 2023,positive,this was simply put a masterpiece that helps bridge the gaps between the realities of death and the general population puss in boots the last wish simply does an amazing job of teaching all audiences of every age the complexities and lessons that come with accepting ones own mortality
Jan 14 2023,negative,shouldve stopped because whatever it is that made the films in the franchise released prior to this have life among its corporate wellrefined but still vapid sense of parody humour is completely missing from this true emotion perhaps either way this did not need to be created and it doesnt have a reason to exist to support everyone elses decision to think that it did without error this is from the guy who has intentionally low standards for things to remain fair in judgment im not just going to like this solely because its a shrek spinoff the first film i would do this is a sequel for a spinoff film from 2011 and even that one was outdated because it was extending from a franchise in which most of its films were released in the 2000s it was already outdated for the progression of culture intolerable enough for reasons that arent being a spinoff just by itself add to something outdated by itself however and it ends up like this with there being no attempt at being real with anything anymore and realising that the public eye has grown less capable of critical thinking
Jan 14 2023,positive,great adults and kids all enjoyed the movie
Jan 14 2023,positive,fun movie for kids and adults
Jan 14 2023,positive,its about death and john mulaney is the monster he is irl
Jan 14 2023,positive,a splendidly evil villain a cute romantic subplot and a quest that comes to a satisfying conclusion make puss in boots the last wish a fantastic animated film that the entire family can enjoy brilliant visuals and stunningly beautiful animation coupled with a heartfelt story free of cringeworthy or woke dialogue present a film reminiscent of the sorelymissed masterpieces disney used to release dreamworks filmmakers gave audiences exactly what theyve been yearning for in an animated feature that is both entertaining and meaningful for all ages
Jan 14 2023,positive,it was a good movie but i do think that it isnt as amazing or groundbreaking as some people made it seem still highly recommend for movie lovers
Jan 14 2023,positive,it was the best movie ive seen in so long
Jan 14 2023,positive,one of the the best dreamworks movies of all time after the first 2 httyd movies prince of egypt and kung fu panda 2
Jan 14 2023,positive,puss and boots movies are just all equally stellar
Jan 14 2023,positive,best shrek movie since shrek 2 perfect remaining of fairy tales characters in a zorro style comedy adventure the villiains ate top tier including death goldi and the bears are charming and big jack honer stole the show as the true big bad     best dreamworks film in ages

Jan 14 2023,positive,the best suprise of the year
Jan 14 2023,positive,puss in boots the last wish is a mustsee film for fans of the beloved feline hero the animation is stunning the voice acting is topnotch and the story is both actionpacked and emotionally resonant the filmmakers have done an excellent job of expanding on the characters and world established in the shrek franchise while still making the film accessible to new audiences the humor is clever and appeals to both children and adults and the themes of friendship and loyalty are beautifully portrayed overall puss in boots the last wish is a cinematic treat that should not be missed 5 out of 5 stars
Jan 14 2023,positive,this movie is a fantastic dip back into the magical works of dreamworks animation and a brilliant examination of mortality and expectations the movie leaves the viewer satisfied and excited to see what comes next from dreamworks great humor great plot amazing animation and lovable characters 1010
Jan 14 2023,positive,watched it no one in the theater room didnt cry at least once or laughted during this movie it connects with all generations and honestly is a masterpice of animation i would take off my hat for those responsible for this rrally considering going to see it again on theather because of how amazing puss in boots 2 is the wolf representing death is honestly scary the message of enjoyng the small things in life and not be greedy is epic just a great movie if i could give it 6 stars i would
Jan 14 2023,positive,its animation style was spectacular and the action sequences was pretty impressive just like spiderman into the spiderverse
Jan 14 2023,positive,impression of puss in boots 2   dont blow this off  i know i know a week ago id never have thought i needed to see this kids movie but everyones been saying its incredible best animated film ive seen all year and best picture of 2022 got it  then they grab me trembling if you dont see it in a theater youll never forgive yourself  so i saw it and good lord its amazing  i knew avatar would be visually spectacular but this little sequel its so funny so innovative in its animation spiderverse has launched a revolution in jazzlike style so engaging in a story that seems lighthearted at first but really tugs at you by the end  i cant think of a moment that wasnt perfect  thats right  its perfect  i wouldnt change a single frame  every aspect of this fairy tale contributes from evil jack horner horrid freak to goldie and her threebear crime family but everonhisheels er paws is a bounty hunter with red glowering eyes that i wont spoil it for you but the film hints at cervantes don quixote and his helper sancho valiantly trying to preserve himself his model of being a hero but the world is suggesting hes a relic  theres a metaphoric death of the dashing swordsman but something better is born  all the while youre laughing at every scene  its a triumph  special mention goes to perro the little dogdressedasacat helper like sancho panza  this side story of being yourself winning by not opposing victory by being incredibly naive or believing in the best at all times its a masterful stroke that adds to this ridiculously stunning work of perfection  perros animators and story writers should get best supporting actor at the oscars  now get to a theater before it leaves youll be begging everyone to see it as well
Jan 14 2023,positive,with an animaton style continuing the great work of the bad guys and an emotional story about facing the one thing you cant beat this movie appeals to both adults and children as a genuine tale of what it means to face your fears    every characters arc is excellent from puss and kitty through to goldilocks and the three bears  also an awesome antagonist which was the perfect representation of the fear most have    the fact it made the kids laugh and be a little scared without making them terrified and made adults talk about whether they fear death means the story has resonated    watch it  again  and again  you will not be disappointed
Jan 14 2023,positive,awesome animation and a great message  well done dreamworks
Jan 14 2023,positive,kids loved it ages 8 and 6 and i was able to find some adultcentered humor as well there were some parts that were a bit scary for the youngest but she was able to troop through
Jan 14 2023,negative,core problem was the nightmare material in this movie for younger kids 7 and under  the 2 villains are very dark so much so that younger kids may cry during and get nightmares after watching    maybe your kid is old enough for this material if so please disregard  i have one 6 and one 10  the 10 yr old enjoyed the 6 yr old cried and is still freaked out of the dark now wasnt before      personally i think dreamworks scriptwriter should punch themself for this content    without giving away too much the 2 villains are unstoppable embodied death embodied as a stalker wolf with scythes and a psychopathic murderer who shoots people    not sure what the creative team was thinking but this seems unnecessarily dark and brooding  the sociopath murderer was twisted but the death wolf  every time he appears puss protagonist has a panic attack    as a fan of kids animation there is a fine line where jokes  story may go over kids heads  is meant for adults or times the kids get it and then have a lot of confusion trying to interpret  this was pronounced here  the moral of the story could have been delivered without traumatizing the youngest in the audience    ive spoken to other parents some had to take their youngest kids crying out of the theater many had to deal with crying scared kids  try to sit thru the movie    go f yourself dreamworks
Jan 14 2023,positive,took the family to the drive ins to see this movie better than the 1st actually funny for everyone kids  adults
Jan 14 2023,positive,really good movie plot has a lot of depth and nostalgia every character is complex enough and movie has something for every age
Jan 14 2023,positive,this is a homerun for dreamworks art style and animation are on point characters are all insanely well designed and voiced and while the story is generally what youd expect from a fantasy kids movie its still more than enticing enough to keep you hooked the entire time
Jan 14 2023,positive,incredible in every way must watch cinema for all ages
Jan 14 2023,positive,loved everything except the change of the style all the jokes were way funnier when the style was more realistic and every time a joke occured i imagiened how much funnier it would be if it was still silly realistic
Jan 14 2023,positive,once again another great movie about puss especially with the hint at the end of the movie go see it
Jan 14 2023,positive,an unexpected masterpiece holy
Jan 14 2023,positive,this movie is so amazing i went into this movie thinking it as a comedy movie but what i got out of it is much more the emotional scenes and fight scenes and most importantly the characters and their develop throughout the film this is 100 must watch and all i am saying is that this movie has the best antagonist i have ever seen beside lord shen
Jan 14 2023,positive,me and my sister loved it its a 1010 dreamworks did their thing 
Jan 14 2023,positive,everything is just right
Jan 14 2023,positive,why tf is this movie so good its puss in boots like the first one was alright but not anything like this
Jan 14 2023,positive,the film transmit between subjects that are not so common for cartoons but that teach real lessons those to take to life in addition of course to bringing in a magical setting several reflections
Jan 14 2023,positive,well that was unexpectedly fantastic i created an account here just so i can give my sincere thanks to the creators and encourage dreamworks studios to continue making movies like this you can feel the love and attention pouring from every frame of this spectacle everyone involved in the writing direction character design animation and sound everyone clearly gave their all to deliver the best movie they could i could tell from the very first minute i was in for something special this is one of the movies that will unironically change lives please go see it support the creators and let our voices be heard this is the kind of film we want to see in theaters this is what we as the audience appreciate and what we call the art of moviemaking
Jan 14 2023,positive,love it great movie  非常喜欢很棒的电影
Jan 14 2023,positive,peak cinema at its best
Jan 14 2023,positive,love that spunky little cat his ending up at the cat ladys house was hilarious worked well and was enjoyable
Jan 14 2023,positive,fucking amazing went to a late night showing at 940pm to distract myself and take my mind of putting a gun in my mouth and it worked it was an amazing movie and an amazing soundtrack with great characters
Jan 14 2023,positive,very colorful and entertaining
Jan 14 2023,positive,when i went to watch this movie i had high hopes when i walked out of the theater i found my hopes blown out of the water during the first action sequence i was taken aback by the quality of the animation for me the animation was most similar to what i had seen in spiderman into the spiderverse but it was executed in such a unique way by alternating between being animated on 2s for the action sequences and being animated at full fps for the dialogue and subtle interactions the fight choreography and dynamic camera movement while being chaotic never left my eyes wondering where to look     in terms of the story it approached complex and difficult questions like the concept of mortality and the value of your own life or what it means to be family and it served me the answer with ketchup and fries it made big questions easy to understand the topics and themes were definitely mature but would still be understandable for younger audiences    each of the characters were as unique and interesting as ive come to expect from dream works the last wish really shows the difference between a villain and an antagonist    on a less positive note it seems the furries have gotten attached to the wolf character oh well
Jan 14 2023,positive,big jack horner is the greatest villain in the history of film
Jan 14 2023,positive,heck yeah puss in boots is literally what i miss with old cartoon movies and they nailed it perfectly thank you dreamworks bravo
Jan 14 2023,positive,an astounding cartoon spectacular animation appealing characters a great story perhaps the best movie i have seen in the past year and i have seen many fine movies this year not for young children though the images are far too intense but for older ones and adults even without kids perfect
Jan 14 2023,positive,the animation the writing the direction everything falls in place so perfectly my only issue is that we didnt really get to see much more of goldilocks relationship and issues with her family it felt like it was squished in there near the end it had a good build up but they didnt spend enough time on the actual conflict other than that this movie is beautiful it handles the character development in such a mature way puss struggling to deal with his anxiety and fear of death is written so well i know i wasnt the only one to start crying during the scene where he has a panic attack as someone who struggles with anxiety it felt so much more accurate than a lot of the depictions ive seen before i hope dreamworks continues to produce movies like this 9710
Jan 14 2023,positive,sweet movie with a clever story and great animation and charming characters really what more could you want
Jan 14 2023,positive,probably the best dreamworks movie so far the animation was great and the story was just right
Jan 14 2023,positive,i prefer old animation style
Jan 14 2023,positive,easily the best movie of 2023 and it is only january all im saying is mario better bring it hard if it wants to beat this one out because puss was fantastic it took all the fairy tale humor and magic that makes the shrek movies amazing and brought it back as someone who grew up watching the shrek movies this was like a trip back to my childhood like i stepped through a portal and became a kid again puss is an amazing character the story and supporting characters are great and spoilers some of those death scenes were actually pretty scary they also included the mild language too was worried they would water it down and not have that but they pulled through and had it all in all great movie great experience a certified dreamworks classic ps was that a shrek 5 teaser at the end i think so and it just makes it all that much better
Jan 14 2023,positive,it ever so quickly changes from another film of a funny loveable cat to a touching story as we witness puss try to escape his fate after taking his lives for granted   to try and escape death is to live a life of denial land fear we experience the beauty of life not in spite of but because of our inevitable morality the world can be horrid and people can be disgustingly cruel but its the relationships and adventures we embrace that makes living worthwhile to enjoy the rewards of being loved we must submit ourselves to the mortifying ordeal of being known
Jan 14 2023,positive,fantastic animation and storyline overall a must see
Jan 14 2023,positive,i cannot express how good this movie is it got me in the feels made me laugh hard enough to hurt my chest and the animation and painterly style of the film is absolutely stunning ill be talking about this movie in the same breath as spiderverse forever
Jan 14 2023,positive,such a cute storyline absolutely loved it
Jan 14 2023,positive,great plot and funny characters we enjoyed it as much as the kids
Jan 14 2023,positive,puss in boots embraces what made the shrek series so timeless in that taking classic childhood charm a few naughty undertheradar jokes mixed in with strong key themes works wonders like a true fairytale
Jan 14 2023,positive,this movie has stunning animation beautiful set and character designs a creative  and well thought out story i did not dislike a single character two examples of found family and also the cat has eyeliner probably the best movie of the past decade at least
Jan 14 2023,positive,this movie was absolutely without a doubt in my opinion the best movie that was released in 2022 which on its own says a lot about how i feel concerning the film the animation was fantastic the script was fantastic and it all culminated together to be very high up among dreamworks best films if you havent watched it already then go and do so it blew everyones expectations out of the water i honestly wasnt expecting to have such a positive opinion about this film with mostly nostalgia just initially leading me to the theatre but lo and behold it became a movie which i can without a doubt easily set high up as one of my topmost favorites
Jan 14 2023,positive,feel good movie with great animation  characters good story good musica good time
Jan 14 2023,negative,got to theater our seats were taken we got differents seats more tham half way through the movie we were asked to move which we did usher sounded like we were lying we will not return
Jan 14 2023,positive,perfectly made entertainment for the whole family
Jan 14 2023,positive,loved it probably the best movie based on the shrek world
Jan 14 2023,positive,i thought a decade wait might steal puss shine but the last wish is a well written and visually great family film the wolf character is a favorite addition with his whistle and his voice nice to have a great moral and friendship theme
Jan 14 2023,positive,i loved every second of this film i was even tearing up best animated film ive seen in a couple years
Jan 14 2023,positive,this was fire cinematic masterpiece 1010 would recommend
Jan 14 2023,positive,oh my god holy crap holy freaking crap    ok first of all the pacing immaculate story lifechanging after seeing the first puss in boots and now this its safe to say that the animation  and the characters  had immense glowup in look the colors the scenery even subtle changes in character design were absolutely phenomenal this movie is a must see especially if you have an appreciation for art and animation 55 movie would rate 10 if possible
Jan 14 2023,positive,this is the best movie i have everseen this guy is my childhood i wish to watch it in cinema but ill just prefer sflix to watch puss in bootsd
Jan 14 2023,positive,actually an amazing movie thought people were hyping it up for some reason but genuinely had everything for a quick family movie
Jan 14 2023,positive,amazing story good art overall poggers
Jan 14 2023,positive,honesntly a near perfect if not perfect movie so phenomenal that i had to make an account just to give it 5 stars it deserves to convince everyone to go watch it you wont regret watching it
Jan 13 2023,positive,it is a good sequel it expands the story of this character that easily likes the change in animation is a plus point and its history leaves great lessons of life

Jan 13 2023,positive,the villains was perfect great character development
Jan 13 2023,positive,fantastic movie witty action excellent plot  it was just fabulously executed and most entertaining
Jan 13 2023,positive,we entered the theatre with low expectations  we came out and was completely overwhelmed with this masterpiece really loved it and had a good laugh
Jan 13 2023,positive,fun for the whole family surprised by how much i liked it
Jan 13 2023,positive,the animation for this movie was off the charts i love antonio banderas and selma hayek in the starring roles the morals of the story can be found when you watch the movie itself and determine where they fall in your life i think dreamworks is giving the other animation companies a run for their money not sure its especially something i would take small children to tweens at the earliest there are dark moments that might scare some youngsters
Jan 13 2023,positive,the 2d and 3d got a little confusing and wow promoting bad language with emotions is something that surprises me  boots was ok they all look like clay figures  but yeah lots of mixed emotions for me
Jan 13 2023,positive,death wolf was the best villain his prescience hits deferent
Jan 13 2023,positive,very funny and enjoyable to watch great animation tied with a fantastic lesson

Jan 13 2023,positive,what a amazing movie
Jan 13 2023,positive,one of my favorite films from dreamworks  improved upon the first film a lot with humor and heart
Jan 13 2023,positive,good story teaches morals
Jan 13 2023,positive,i feel like that i always give huge ratings to content that i enjoy but i was someone who was not asking for a sequel to a puss and boots movie this one brings such a unique style than the first one i love spiderverse style animation and plot for this film the fairytale characters work well and the wolf is my favorite shrek villain after this movie i would definitely watch a shrek 5 i didnt know i would say that but that is how much i enjoyed this movie
Jan 13 2023,positive,this is so good1111 you have to go see this  its gorgeous art style its great story its great villains everything is done so well and is freaking amazing edit i heard that people think death is too scary for children and as a kid myself if your kid is afraid of death in this movie your a terrible parent kids should be allowed to learn about these things and learn to deal with them in a healthy way death pain heartbreak and sadness are not foreign to kids and not letting your kid learn about how to cope with these things in a healthy way it could lead to depression or worse please dont refuse to let your kid watch things like this movie just because you think it would be too scary
Jan 13 2023,positive,the best movie of all times  super musical score   super character   super villains   the best animation i have ever seen  this movie is a must watch even as a standalone fking love it
Jan 13 2023,positive,i loved this movie the colors the animation the fights  it is a must see
Jan 13 2023,positive,best animated movie i have ever seen hands down
Jan 13 2023,positive,the fact they were able to make a 36 yr old grown man tense up every time the wolf or death came on the screen was so well done  the animation was top level as well definitely a visual upgrade from previous iterations in the puss in boots  shrek cinematic universe  finally this movie has a great message behind it
Jan 13 2023,positive,puss in boots the last wish is a phenomenal movie for any audience old or young i was entertained throughout the whole duration of this film from the story characters set pieces and the superb animation i was also surprised at how they tackled the topic of anxiety and its effects something you would not expect from a childrens movie as someone that has dealt with anxiety for most of their life a lot of scenes hit close to home for me and i have to say it was handled perfectly this movie is full to the brim with emotional moments high octane set pieces and fight choreography that rivals the likes of anime shows like demon slayer i cannot recommend this movie enough and hopefully it will leave a lasting impression on you as it has done so for me
Jan 13 2023,positive,movie of the year the emotions this movie made me feel i just did not expect from a puss in boots movie all the characters were given plenty of screen time the themes explored in this movie are fantastic great pacing but one character definitely steals the show every time there on screen a must watch film
Jan 13 2023,positive,this is just too good
Jan 13 2023,positive,this movie was amazing some could even say perfect stakes were high and it had a good story it also has some of spiderverses animation style at some scenes that were intense i do kind of miss humpty dumpty though but kitty softpaws and the dog were cool this is my favorite animated movie of the year and if you dont watch this you are missing out on so much
Jan 13 2023,positive,went in with 0 expectations left out compelled by the quality and wanting to watch it again and that villain what a great one
Jan 13 2023,positive,movie was amazing csn pause on any scene and it is like a painting it looks like they took inspiration from into the spider verse movie tackles with mortality really well and executes animation perfectly 1010 i would watch again
Jan 13 2023,positive,just proves dreamworks  disney
Jan 13 2023,positive,the only thing wrong with this movie was the underprepared release date it was overshadowed by many other movies such as avatar guillermos pinocchio etc i love how dreamworks and other studios similar have realised that animation isnt about being hypersurrealistic its about genuine visual storytelling through art studios are remembering that animation isnt a genre its a medium for visual storytelling and i cant believe how dreamworks managed to pull off a childrens movie with three villains great stuff dreamworks cant wait to see this hybrid animation implemented into kung fu panda
Jan 13 2023,positive,i love how they chose a predictable plot but with lots of twist and fun way of giving life values and lessons for every group of awesome characters along the way its very creative and entertaining
Jan 13 2023,positive,there is no reason for a sequel to a spinoff of god damn shrek to be so good but here we are 1010
Jan 13 2023,positive,such an exciting movie the animation draws you in and the fight scenes are just immaculate this has to be one of the best kids movies of all time what a way to start 2023 with this
Jan 13 2023,positive,the best animated movie ive seen after kung fu panda 3
Jan 13 2023,positive,bro thats the best movie i have seen in years actually i thought it is going to ruin the puss in boots sequel but it made it 10x better thats a must watch

Jan 13 2023,positive,i loved this movie  keep making movies like these no genderswap characters or character sexuality swappedthis movie was perfect
Jan 13 2023,positive,the animation used every asset to its full potential adding to the amazing story using trust and fear to captivate the audience with multiple characters that have plot twists to keep people on the edge of their seat bringing back an old worn out puss in boots fearful of losing his last life bringing the audience closer to the character and sustained throughout the whole movie
Jan 13 2023,positive,this movie has a critical story with a deep explanation which helps the audience know what the definition is about with context i watched this in the movie theater and turned out that the movie is incredibly good and how well the writer seriously focuses on this story helps the audience keep interested and is less bored my rate is 1010 for an excellent job well done guys also i am willing to keep watching this over and over again
Jan 13 2023,positive,absolutely loved it
Jan 13 2023,positive,one of the best movies of 20222023 plus this my be the year for dreamworks

Jan 12 2023,positive,puss in boots the last wish is a long wait 11 years from the first movie and it feels like the narratives and comedy of dreamworks has matured as you would expect it to in that time gone are the cheap bits at shock humor that haunted shrek entries and especially tonedeaf in the kung fu panda trilogy replaced with mature humor that will strike a note with audiences of all ages similarly the narrative has grown up a thrilling tale of confronting ones own mortality and the fear of death itself this movie takes risks not only in its animation style but its plot and humor as well and every single gamble dreamworks made paid off 100 fold watch this movie

Jan 11 2023,positive,so funny and the animation is insane 555555
Jan 11 2023,positive,be forewarned lots of violence talks if murdering and not caring about people dying that could be saved and characters from kids stories and nursery rhyme acting evilly some turn a new leaf some dont there are comments about how some of it is wrong     not a movie for the younger kids middle s schoolers can probably handle it if you dont care about the above      but the audience members seeming to enjoy it the most were the 20s30s i heard some of them say it was their second time and they wanted to see it on the big screen again i went with a couple of others 56  65       i really enjoyed the allusions to other stories and movies for example pinnochio the theme from the good the bad and the ugly it was clever animation of puss looked like he was 3d i hate chihuahuas but i learned to like what id thought would be an annoying character  loved the effects and the concept of the map variations      go see it its fun

Jan 11 2023,positive,fantastic animation emotionally moving plot and sick af beats
Jan 11 2023,positive,amazing movie i personally didnt know this came out was not particularly interested in it but seeing all the amazing reviews and what the people were saying about it got me quite exited decided to give it and go and i am extremely happy i did this movie has everything stunning visuals awesome character arcs and personalities and very emotion filled     i am someone who doesnt feel huge emotions watching movies generally but the introduction of the wolf gave me absolute chill there is plenty of big emotional moments in this movie truly one of the best animated movie i have seen in the last years

Jan 11 2023,positive,loved the story the characters and a perfect movie for kids and adults
Jan 11 2023,positive,the best animated movie to have come out in 2022 the last movie i had thought was fine around a 255 but this movie absolutely blew me away my biggest complaint was that it wasnt long enough as it had so much going for it that i felt there were many things i wanted to be fleshed out more thoroughly the visuals are amazing think into the spiderverse combined with shrek but in a good way that makes it feel grounded and realistic but still with color and style that pop out like a comic book cover yet for the whole movie the plot was also very engaging i felt interested the whole time and the biggest thing for me was how the movie felt comfortable having more mature concepts in a kids movie which i remember when  i was 710 years old i loved seeing in movies and a young relative who also watched it agreed with me on that too it wasnt completely flawless but truly the pinnacle of what kids movies can be
Jan 11 2023,positive,this movie made me feel warm and fuzzy
Jan 11 2023,positive,great theme nice sound
Jan 11 2023,positive,a fantastic return to form for dreamworks especially after how amazing they did with the bad guys earlier last year taking a beautiful spiderverseesque stylized approach to animation that provides a breath of fresh air to a series that i personally felt looked somewhat dull as it aged fight scenes were beautifully made with amazing comedy for all ages overall just a fantastic movie for everyone
Jan 11 2023,positive,loved it cute and hilarious
Jan 11 2023,positive,loved everything about the movie the story the concept the characters animation nostalgia everything was top tier and i dont even do reviews
Jan 11 2023,positive,it was a good storyline with a good ending but the animation has changed to half how it used to be and half like its in a classic comic book or an anime i do not like the change noor do i think that the mix between works
Jan 11 2023,positive,stunning visuals fluid and exciting action and surprisingly mature themes easy 55
Jan 11 2023,negative,its terrible people around me were laughing at what its so unfunny it hurts
Jan 11 2023,positive,incredible and surprising

Jan 10 2023,positive,an absolutely amazing film thats one of if not the best animated movies to come out in the past several decades the last wish takes the surprising oppurtunity to tackle the struggles of life and death managing to depict and do both justice with the tact they deserve while bringing us along for a ride thats entertaining and relatable to all ages and along for the showing are some of the best villains ive seen make a debut in a kids show in decades managing to encompass several antagonists that are truly evil either misguided or forces of nature without any feeling left out or underdeveloped     the last wish was clearly made by people who cared and a team of writers who wanted to do puss justice and they succeed in making an absolute must watch movie you could even go so far as to easily make the arguement that it surpasses the shrek movies which spawned it
Jan 10 2023,positive,going into this movie i thought it was going to be a quick cash grab but it feels like such a passion project the animation is beautiful the storyline is fantastic the character design is gorgeous and overall its hilarious i think its my new favorite of all time and i recommend everyone at least gives it a chance

Jan 10 2023,negative,im over so much violence in kids movies its scary for kids and its not enjoyable or clever i dont want to hear about big jack horner wanting to shoot a puppy in the face deaths constant whistle was horror movie creepy a lot of kids were leaving the cinema to take a break from the intense scenes  shrek was great because it was funny and light hearted and the violence was less intense and more comedic this was too much i think using so much violence is pretty storyline wise
Jan 10 2023,positive,this movie was amazing i watched it in theaters and seeing it on a big screen made it much better the animation style the humor the voice acting amazing i completely recommend it and if you can watch it in theaters

Jan 9 2023,positive,it was very good movie

Jan 9 2023,positive,we loved the scary wolf
Jan 9 2023,positive,wow what a amazing movie
Jan 9 2023,negative,not for kids   although there was no real gore there was constant violence  dark  while the swearing did not bother me much it was totally not necessary  the story line itself is good the quest for the star  but because the story and characters was constantly flipping back and forth in reference to old fairy tails and fairy tail characters it was complex to follow especially for anyone who may not even be too familiar with some of the old time fairy tails   like other reviewers and i could only relate to this after seeing the show  the red eyed wolf grim reaper could leave kids with nightmares     best over all description for this movie is weird   it was a missed opportunity    i cant call it a bad movie  but it is definitely weird based on the things above and i would not take my kids to see it  we only went to see it due to lack of other better movie choices available
Jan 9 2023,positive,great movie my family and i loved it great service as well
Jan 9 2023,positive,took the kids we all loved it good plot and story line love how if all intertwined with the other story characters
Jan 9 2023,positive,english not first language its a example of how to do fairy tals movies  this movie have a lot of references to many fairy tales has a moral and good animations this is a movie you want to show your kids as an 19 years old i find this hitting me hard as it have many references to our world now with many jokes that only adults will understand but are harmless to kids the way the characters are made are amaizing every character have depth and is build creativly quality of this animations are great and i cant hold myself from watching it again after a first watch i cant say i anything bad about this movie its must see
Jan 9 2023,positive,such a fun well animated movie that stood its ground without really even needing to watch his netflix show or prior movie such an excellent antagonist and the light hearted moments are really sweet and enjoyable the movie gave puss so much depth and perfectly balanced the comedy and the serious parts honestly it was such a great watch
Jan 9 2023,positive,its almost ridiculous how good of a movie this is especially after the first puss in boots movie was largely forgettable the animation is great with the action and art style taking on an aesthetic reminiscent of spiderman into the spiderverse at times said animation might look a bit choppy at times but it helps to sell the overthetop nature of some really impressive action pieces  aside from that the storys pretty good and surprisingly emotional at times and even contains some intense moments that could almost pass for light horror no surprise that these tend to happen when the wolf character see in the trailers appears without giving anything away the story also has a good message about life itself thats a good takeaway from the whole movie  theres still plenty of funny moments but dont go in expecting it to be a fullon comedy like the past shrek movies and spinoffs    all in all i had a great time with this and i also recommend seeing this on the big screen if you can hopefully this is the start of a good upswing in dreamworks animated library
Jan 8 2023,positive,this was a funny spiritual movie this is a teaching lesson if you really look at it great movie
Jan 8 2023,positive,kids loved the movie very funny
Jan 8 2023,positive,such an incredible movie with beautiful animation gosh i love this movie so much
Jan 8 2023,positive,the last wish was entertaining the story was really good and funny very colourful and with a lot of imagination they used the animation techniques from spiderverse in the action sequence and it brought a lot of dynamics and style into them the voice acting were very strong my only problem were with the spanish parts that didnt seem translated but they are not numerous the music was great i give it 85 a movie for all family even if you get some more adult jokes you also get some parts for the younger audience nicely done and fun
Jan 8 2023,positive,liked big bad wolf  liked when puss n boots got his courage back at the end of the movie and defended his honor
Jan 8 2023,positive,i personally love this film because as a kid puss in boots was and still is one of my favorite characters in the animated world honestly this film is a must see for puss in boots fans and it shows a great message to the audience
Jan 8 2023,positive,never have i enjoyed a movie as this one

Jan 8 2023,positive,i really liked the movie bringing a very cool new theme that for 11 years i wondered if there would be another movie and there was and in my opinion in history and details it does better than the first one the only thing i found a little weird is what cats usually say which has 7 lives not 9 but it did not affect the story in fact it is very well detailed it brings that like from shrek which is the franchise that we love so much mainly with the postcredits and the villain not even mentioned in the first one he is a villain then he becomes a hero in the second there are 3 villains curly the wolf and joaosao trumpet very good i hope they continue like this
Jan 8 2023,positive,it was ok  thats all i can say  would i see it again  no
Jan 8 2023,positive,fantastic honestly one of my favorite movies written really well and the characters are prefect i love the way they portrayed death and the fight scenes are amazing

Jan 8 2023,positive,great animation and nice story i really enjoyed it i only give 5 stars to most excellent films
Jan 8 2023,positive,amazing writing its rare to watch an animated film that actually has a story relatable to both adults and children and puss in boots the last wish does just that for starters all the voiceovers were outstanding and all of the characters had something to offer than just their presence in the story the characters and the story itself had moments of joy laughter and tears the humor was particularly relatable and funny again for both adults and children the pacing was spot on and the 102 minute runtime just flew by this is one of the better animations ive seen in a while and i love how the ending lead up to the next sequel to shrek a must watch for everyone
Jan 8 2023,positive,fun adventurous hilarious powerful meaning epic and most of all    absolutely no political correctness or woke values    amazing movie now in my list of top 10 favorite animated films
Jan 8 2023,positive,dude this movie is so good please watch it immediately this and spider verse are two of the best animated movies i have ever seen
Jan 8 2023,positive,puss in boots  avatar
Jan 8 2023,positive,i loved this movie but i still think the first one was better i personally did not really see the need for the dog either in the story death was by far my favorite dreamworks movie villain though
Jan 8 2023,positive,watched the portuguese version ptpt the movie is funny from the beginning until the end visually it is also amazing its a must watch with or without kids
Jan 8 2023,positive,no joke an absolutely incredible experience as well as fresh and stunningly gorgeous the animation style is very similar to spider man into the spiderverse but is also significantly different enough to mean something else to the audience    so many creative choices that span across the whole movie and creative choices that stick to certain scenes are incredibly welldone and lovable the choice to personify death is one of my favorite villains of alltime and he is so well done it legitimately brings me to tears the scene where puss in boots is fleeing from the cave of lost souls and is comforted by perrito the choice to legitimately make a heartwrenching and emotionpacked scene is so awesome when i know that adding a tensionrelieving joke would have been so easy     but its not all serious afterall it is a kids movie but to call it a kids movie is a strawman it is so so much more the jokes are welldone and the references to pop culture not the bees are both cringey and lovable just how i like them the wish plotline is a common trope but is so well done in this movie through the incredible relationships between characters goldi and the bears are a group that want the wish to have a family but already have one kitty softpaws wants the wish to trust someone but through the journey she gains that naturally puss in boots wants the wish to get more lives and to make his glorydays last forever but learns that this isnt what he truly wants jack horner is a greedy doofus and genuinely has some great jokes as well as serving alongside death as a sort of timekeeper     incredible movie the 1010 rating is overdone but i legitimately think this movie was pulled off nighperfect and is an incredible addition to the animated movies world
Jan 8 2023,positive,phenomenal movie excellent and unique animation style with awesome use of frame rate changes during fight scenes forget if you didnt like the first one puss in boots 2 is miles ahead in every aspect from its predecessor some scary scenes that may not be the best for under 8 year olds
Jan 8 2023,positive,a must watch this movie is filled with beautiful animation belly laughing and tear jerking moments it had a mature story that adults can love while still keeping things lighthearted for children i grew up with the shrek films and im happy to see that dreamworks hasnt lost their spark
Jan 8 2023,positive,the animation style straight out of spiderman into the spiderverse are killing it the story is great considering its a sequel to puss in boots which wasnt fantastic the message of having one life and appreciating it is great and the movie doesnt beat you with it the plotline with kitty having trust issues is actually very well done many movies like for example raya and the last dragon these days try to feed it to you through a tube while screaming at your face do you get the message death as a character is one of if not the best and most scary villians from dreamworks movies in the first scene with him i had litteral chills when they showed puss bleeding i was not expecting them to show something like this in a kids moviethe idea that litteral death is trying to kill you is terrifying i expected to hate the supporting dog character but i didnt its nice to see a such a positive character interacting with all those sad and bitter for the most part characters his backstory was so tragic it almost made me cry tt  easily one of the best movies by dreamworks 1210 would watch again
Jan 8 2023,positive,amazing animation great humor loveable characters and an good story made it so i never wanted this movie to end
Jan 8 2023,positive,great action and enough funny things to entertain my 9 year old
Jan 8 2023,positive,puss in boots is easily the best entry in the shrek franchise from its watercolor aesthetic to the emotional script consistent wit and incredible fight scenes there is nothing short of perfection in just about every aspect of this movie
Jan 8 2023,positive,love love it great movie super funny
Jan 8 2023,positive,this was such a perfectly made movie the art style alone should be enough of a draw for anyone who appreciates animation the characterisation is just so lovely and heart wrenching the plot is thought provoking and i cant put it into words how much i recommend this movie i really did enjoy every second
Jan 8 2023,positive,ill get this out of the way first this movie is fantastic plain and simple its great its creative its funny its touching its scary its mature its intelligent its entertaining for both kids and adults its a goddamn puss in boots the last wish i think we can all agree that this is the last title anyone here can associate with top notch quality i mean its a sequel to a spinoff movie from over 10 years ago a rather mediocre one at that and yet this movie goes far and beyond any expectations and makes itself into probably the best animated movie of 2022 but then again this is coming from a studio that made kung fu panda series be known as one of the finest animation series as well    but lets get to the details first being the animation its gorgeous its amazing how well this movie looks with its spiderverse like animation and further proves how chasing after realizm in animated movies is at this point a fools errand that kind of misses the point of animated movies but its not just a ripoff spiderverse in looks oh no when that movie looked like a comic book that came to life this one feels like a illustrated fairy tale book the paint brush aesthetic looks great its colorful and feels alive its animated in a fantastic way and i think its best described in saying that the fight with the giant from the trailers is not the best part of this movie oh no it only gets better from there 1010 on visuals    now to the characters i love pretty much all of them puss in boots of course takes center stage here and his character is at its best here in terms of depth and humor he is cocky bastard at first but as he loses his next to last life he quickly gets humbled and reminded of his now very apparent mortality and his character goes through great amount of growth its very nice to see his character evolve like it does in this movie another stand out i say is the wolf who i can already tell will give several children nightmares and thats good you know a good fairy tale from the amount of scarred children it leaves in its wake people that made this do not hold back with how scary they make this character he is by far the best thing in the movie from his fights the change in mood whenever he appears and the music that accompanies him he is definitely one of the best villains i saw in an animated movie but i could argue if its okay to call him one but that would mean getting into spoilers other characters such as kitty softpaws goldielocks three bears jack horner and perrito are all very fun as well goldie and her family are a very sweet family that go through their own journey in this and could be said they are deutragonists of this movie i really enjoyed them their chemistry and their sweet development jack horner though i say this he is by far the funniest part in this movie he is a bastard plain and simple and he is hilarious because of it and a certain character that is alongside him for a good chunk of the movie as for kitty its very nice to see her back and her story tied with puss is very interesting and i like how they do not linger too long on her drama with puss and resolve it in a more real way that doesnt derail the movie in any way and then there is perrito who many probably thought was going to be an annoyance but he is by far the heart of this movie and he is involved in probably the most touching scene in the movie you will know when you see it all in all characters another 10 its incredible how there are so many of them and all of them are fun and likeable in their own way    the story itself is very simple its a race to get the last wish from a fallen star its as fairy taleish as you can get but the way its executed the way each character changes well most of them at least on this journey and how imaginative and creative the setups and environments are make it feel fresh and it really leaves an impact on you dont be fooled by the marketing this movie deals with very heavy subjects such as death mortality and appreciating ones life and acceptance of death its a heavy movie in terms of themes but its so great to see that with it it still is a very entertaining movie with many clever jokes great pacing fantastic music oh my god the music is great in it as well heitor pereira did a a job here and colorful world and characters it is a movie that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and that is something that is so good to see today and this movie very well utilizes its pg rating kids need parental guidance in this movie it is not a movie you put on to shut them up you put it on because you want to show them something great something they can have fun with be scared of and learn from and i think a lot of adults can sympathize with struggles characters face in this movie and laugh at the more adult jokes as well overall from story standpoint its also 1010 its not a new story or message but it is told in a way that makes it feel new and fresh and it tackles it in a mature way    as for flaws ehhhh hard for me to find really to me its as perfect as animated flick can get again puss in boots the last wish god is this a weird thing to say maybe there are some pacing issues with goldies story and her family conflict being resolved quickly during climax and one character is pretty damn 1dimensional but i would argue its to add to the comedy and charm of said character since that one is not meant to be seen as anything more serious it is not one the same level of greatness as prince of egypt obviously but as far as shrek movies go or most dreamworks movies go or hell most animated movies go overall its pretty damn close to the top to me in shrek franchise its on the same level as shrek 2 to me and its a high high praise    i have to say i always preferred dreamworks over pixar yes they do have far lower lows than the animation juggernaut but to me they had higher highs with movies such as prince of egypt or kung fu panda movies and the fact that i can say kung fu panda series is one of the best pieces of animation is hilarious and i found their good movies to be far more rewatchable than pixar ones but since then they kind of went down with quality sadly but recently with the bad guys and now this movie i think its safe to say that they are officially back and maybe better than ever this movie i think proves how great movies from dreamworks can be today and i think if they keep on going in this direction we may get more very special movies from this studio and i wish them the best of luck on this road and for this movie to become greater and greater success maybe even winning an academy award as meaningless as that became as of late    what can i say anymore its about 95 to 1010 to me i love it and i think many people will love it as well probably not to the same degree as me but i think this will make your day and the new year that much better its worth your money its worth your time its worth your attention and by all means its worth watching more than once
Jan 8 2023,positive,childrens movie loud at times a dash of liberal agenda but not woke surprisingly fun you wont hate it

Jan 8 2023,positive,as with all animated films for kids sometimes there is violence and theres always a chase scene the bad guy versus the good guy   i guess action films are what keep the young ones alert and on their toes   i noticed a lot of kids in the audience laughing when they were bleeping out the curse words   this movie did have a good moral to the story happy endings are always welcome these days
Jan 8 2023,positive,entertaining though the third act feels unfinished and the payoff slightly underwhelming with the wolf
Jan 8 2023,negative,idk there wasnt any good humor there was a lot of scary parts for my young kids and the mixed animation for the fight scenes felt disjointed and weird     i hated it
Jan 8 2023,positive,hadnt even watched a preview and had low expectations going in  ended up being pleasantly surprised  funny and some emotional moments  i think they will milk puss until hes dry  pun intended  not that thats a bad thing

Jan 8 2023,positive,i never thought this movie would be good cause of the first one but this movie is amazing from the quality to the animation the fight scenes were just beautiful but the reason why i am rating this a 45 instead of a 5 is from the ending i found it a bit corny with all the friendship stuff but yea its a kids movie overall its a good movie and you should watch it

Jan 7 2023,positive,i want that wolf to whistle into me
Jan 7 2023,positive,literally peak cinema greatest animated movie since spiderman into the spider verse
Jan 7 2023,positive,would argue this is even better than the first one amazingly animated great work from the entire cast especially banderaz hayek and pugh everyone can learn a lesson from this movie it was perfectly balanced between emotional heart felt moments and the humor we all know and love
Jan 7 2023,positive,it is a complex study of all phases of life and facing up to your own mortality  the movie sort of glorifies murderousness so it was rough seeing little girls in fairy tale dresses watching the movie  however for an adult or late teen the movie is really enjoyable  other than the usual cast of characters goldilocks kind of steals the show  my nine year old enjoyed it but the content was not appropriate for her in my conservative opinion  tv14
Jan 7 2023,positive,its an awesome show the animation the sound design and the scenery is outstanding the plot and the execution of the story is just to die for moving sad happy frightening overwhelming and calming each in their own scene so many emotions throughout one story and none of them felt forced or out of place    spoiler warning  some specifics i especially liked   death the metaphor of death and the disliking of multiple cat lives embodied as a fearsome wolf on the hunt is one of the best ideas this movie couldve used the character itself when looked back on is blatantly obvious but the viewer might not even know what they are facing until its clearly told their ambition and huntthrill build a compelling obstacle character who isnt straight up evil their motif isnt inherently to kill puss but to punish someone who hasnt valued their life while they were thrown so many chances to do so i respect that   perrito i dont even know where to start our pup is so blatantly traumatized they dont even notice it the support they provide to anyone who crosses their path is amazing especially since theyve had noone who wanted them up until the movies story they also represent a part of quite a lot of peoples life where they rely on therapy animals to go about their days and be able to overcome anxiety attacks get general emotional support or maybe even thoroughly aided help which a companion can provide the scene where puss had a meltdown and perrito laid on them felt real in atmosphere just as in accuracy as anxiety aid companions often apply pressure to help the body calm down i love what perrito stands for   the animation it is dynamic it isnt a constant and thats what makes it so compelling and satisfying to look at the framerate constantly changes the simplified special effects give an entire different tone to a scene and the ever changing flashing colors make for an amazing environment which doesnt stop moving when a good fight comes up the camera work is so well done its always clear to see what the power of the current shot is as an animation nerd myself i bow to this cinematic masterpiece    ive talked enough all in all i can only recommend this movie    get your tissues ready because youll be in for an emotional rollercoaster
Jan 7 2023,positive,fantastic movie might scare younger children though
Jan 7 2023,positive,it was good very cute my granddaughter and daughter loved it too
Jan 7 2023,positive,this movie goes hard real hard no reason to but it does the story the characters the morals death not a single thing to dislike about this movie best animated movie of 2022 hands down
Jan 7 2023,positive,so good loved this movie
Jan 7 2023,positive,it was a really phenomenal and very enjoyable dreamworks animated family movie it had really majestic animation really amazing voice cast really awesome action really well done comedy really thrilling adventure really imaginative fantasy very extraordinary music really beautiful visuals and a really impressive plot in my opinion i think its one of my new favorite animated movies ive ever saw in theaters in my whole life i really recommend this movie to both kid and adults
Jan 7 2023,positive,puss in boots the last wish was one of the biggest surprises of 2022 this was not a movie that anyone was asking for yet it was incredibly charming and fun the film merges two animation styles which are both gorgeous and cutting edge there are moments of traditional dreamworks animation and others that are similar to spiderman into the spiderverse    the characters introduced in this film are reminiscent of those in the first two shrek movies each character is carefully thought out and evokes an emotional response whether that be hope fascination or fear from the confused goldilocks to the adorable perrito to the fearsome lobo everyone brings something new to the table    there is honestly not a lot to criticize about puss in boots the last wish the film hit darker notes than previous shrek films and there were moments in the theater when kids shrieked some of the scenes are a little drawn out but the story itself is strong    for those with small children be aware that there is a strong use of hell and some cleverly censored words throughout the movie otherwise the film is perfectly appropriate more than some other shrek movies for kids    puss in boots the last wish is the best animated film of 2022 and the best shrek film since shrek 2 not that the competition is very stiff the animation is stunning the voiceacting crisp and the story is interesting for both children and adults even if you havent seen the first puss in boots go and see this movie you will not be disappointed    also the new dreamworks opening is excellent    best character perrito  best scene reading the map  best quote maybe one life is enough  perrito
Jan 7 2023,negative,a childrens movie this isnt i have never heard a whole theatre full of children cry at once before i had to hold my 5 year old grandchild in my lap and tell her it was all fake i guess i should have done a little more research but was caught up in the old story no wonder 6 year old children are shooting their teachers so sad satan is here
Jan 7 2023,positive,unexpected drops of hell and crap sprinkled throughout  was a great movie overall
Jan 7 2023,positive,beautiful movie good for children and adults
Jan 7 2023,positive,dreamworks makes the best villains in my opinion and the mix of mature and for kid in the movie is mixed perfectly
Jan 7 2023,positive,loved the visuals and animation this film has a great style fun character and a thought provoking story its a little dark so i wouldnt recommend it for younger kids but older kids and parents are sure to have a great time

Jan 7 2023,positive,some of the fight scenes in the movie seemed disjointed like some of the screenshots were missing or something
Jan 7 2023,positive,one of the best movies of 2022 the wolf is the best movie villain of 2022 i dont care what anyone else says but the wolf was perfect the voice acting the animation was just amazing i really hope this movie makes 1 billion dollars in the box office and goes on to make a third puss in boots
Jan 7 2023,positive,this was one of my favorite animated movies in quite a while dreamworks proved once again its one of the best the music was great the animation switches were perfect and the script was entertaining this movie wears its influences proudly on its sleeve and creates another classic and particularly intimidating villain
Jan 7 2023,positive,a very good and wholesome family movie the voice acting was spot on the story was spot on and the animation was good as well i especially loved the depiction of death in this movie i really hope the last scene is a hint that there will be a sequel and it will include you know who 
Jan 7 2023,negative,great animation great visuals for small children thats about it
Jan 7 2023,positive,fun to watch like the characters

Jan 7 2023,positive,my 19 and 20 yo old sons who grew up with this franchise went with their mates and both cohorts loved the movie which convinced us to go  thoroughly enjoyed it it was funny sad great visual effects and animation bits and pieces were maybe a little drawn out but so are parts of my everday life  there were so many easter eggs and it was fun naming the various characters we recognised along the way  some say its not a movie for young kids as there are some scary parts and if thats the case well its definitely a movie theyll enjoy when they get older
Jan 7 2023,positive,this movie has some of the most thrilling animation and impactful character development ive seen in a while the villain is probably one of the best and most hauntingly threatening villains ive seen in an animation ever 5 stars go see it it is a great installment to the franchise and a perfect standalone film as well as one of the best films dreamworks has produced so far

Jan 7 2023,positive,honestly i went into this not expecting much however this movie was amazing for a few reasons 1 it was a sequel but not watching the first pib movie it felt like its own movie 2 it was funny and lastly 3 the wolf was actually incredibly intimidating and had serious presence unlike any character i have seen in an animated film the story was cute funny well written it had amazing character development achieved and felt realistic in such a short period of time shrek universe  se has had many duds imo but this movie was probably the second best only after the og shrek

Jan 7 2023,positive,ok plot with family at the end of it not understanding the need forcrapand the beeps for words that cannot be used does a 8 yo need it or are the adults immature the wolf death unnerved a few kids in the audience and his purpose went a bit over heads esp with the end the fight scenes are like early manga dont you miss movies before computer generated drawing it is an average movie for a rainy day with 8 kids over 7 yo to crowd around but mind the wolf
Jan 7 2023,positive,puss the boots the last wish is a funny movie and i like it first and second were good
Jan 7 2023,positive,good story line good adaptation of fairy tale and nursery time lots of action for kids

Jan 6 2023,positive,its a kids film its not going to blow your mind but for a kids film it is an awesome time its better than most movies out with an allround captivating crew of characters including one of the best villainish characters the wolf that ive seen in a long time all the characters are likeable and investable and the emotional plot of the film is handled really well plus some good morals to boot fun family friendly watch
Jan 6 2023,positive,great movie kis loved it
Jan 6 2023,positive,this movie was not what i was expecting i thought it it was gonna be a generic side character movie like the first one was but when i saw the animation style i and how it was influenced by spiderman into the spider verse i was hooked this movie was aesthetingly pleasing and the movie premise was actually so good this movie is on par with shrek 2 i loved the antagonists and all the side characters like the dog perrito and kitty softpaws i loved the main antagonists being death and jack horner allthough i didnt know who the character jack horner was he was a very funny characters with his design and the way he acted with no regard for his goons i also loved the way they described death in this movie they describe them as a scary character that has the motive of death will always find you and wherever you run i will always find you this movie also has alot of character development for example the protagonist puss in boots is shown at first as an egoistic self centered person who sees himself like a living legend who doesnt fear death but later when he dies and is down to his last life he encounters actuall death and is scared for his life running away and as described in the movie always comes back for him this was probably one of the best animated movies ive ever seen
Jan 6 2023,positive,enjoyable but not as good as original just didnt develop a connection with new characters until late in the movie worthy effort but you can wait for streaming unless you are a big fan 
Jan 6 2023,positive,didnt think the funny silly cat movie would make me emotional but wow that was very sweet well worth the hype in every facet

Jan 6 2023,positive,this movie was absolutely amazing a masterclass in story writing and pacing great characters all across the board most movies cant develop a single character properly in an entire 2h movie this movie manages to develop and make you interested in 3 villains and 3 main characters all while advancing the film ive never been a fan of children movies because of how simple their messages are however this movie is a one in a million  seriously great stuff enjoyable for all the family  lots of more mature jokes that land very well it is as good as shrek 2  and that is saying a lot

Jan 5 2023,positive,i havent liked anything dreamworks has made in the past 5 years but this was the best movie experience of 2022 i was so surprised that the movie managed to balance 3 different antagonists the final act was beautifully animated and so much fun the story is simple and understandable for kids but the movie isnt hamfisted my group of adult friends were not irritated by any of the dialogue or choices the characters made after watching avatar 2 i still think i would prefer watch this movie twice than watch avatar 2
Jan 4 2023,positive,took my 9 year old daughter to see puss in boots and surprisingly it was better than i expected

Jan 4 2023,positive,this was an absolute treat to watch i havent been a fan of animated movies for years now but the amount of passion the storytelling the character progression the carefully crafted humor and how badass the main villain was made this my favorite animated movie of the past 10 years easily i hugely recommend this fantastic film

Jan 4 2023,positive,this movie was so much better than the first one and thats cause i loved the first one as well hands down this movie is probably the best movie ive seen in a couple years i extremely loved it so much humor and likeable characters this movie is absolutely fascinating planning to watch it again next week go watch you will not regret
Jan 4 2023,positive,this moive wasnt one i thought would be that great thought it would be a typical kids moive but this moive this is literally my favorite moive of the year its amazing the animation is amazing and beautiful the story is greatly told and oh my gawd that wolf terrifys me this moive is unexpectedly kinda adulty and i love it point is watch this moive its amazing and it deserves the attention it needs
Jan 4 2023,positive,was a great movie with a good  storyline and a new style of animation similar to spiderman into the spiderverse loved it had great action sequences watch out for the little ones and a good bit of darker humor like shrek overall i and my son both enjoyed it
Jan 4 2023,positive,this was a very wellmade movie  you have to weather the first 10 minutes  very cringey and selfcongratulatory  hard to watch and over the top  wish they could have conveyed the cats arrogance in a way that was easier to watch but it is what it is  but by the end of the movie my daughter and i are both wiping tears out of our eyes  i loved how they drew on other familiar fairy tales  so dang funny  and the wolf  oh my gosh what a character we all were so impressed with the wolf
Jan 4 2023,positive,i love this movie it is an absolutely amazing movie i loved the ending of the movie believe me if you love puss in boots you will love this movie im not a huge fan of puss in boots and i loved this movie i would definitely watch it again and definitely recommend for you to watch it
Jan 4 2023,positive,far exceeded my expectations based on the trailers
Jan 4 2023,positive,the movie has amazing character development both ways antagonistprotagonist the animation in this case is sweet and cozy i enjoyed the wide palette of vivid colors within the movie the plot leaves a good message it is a very well made movie it exceeds my expectations coming from a childrens movie
Jan 4 2023,positive,i havent watch the other movies so i cant compare but this one is good funny and describe the feelings of fear and diffident from different angles enjoyed how dreamworks included different stories from different characters we know
Jan 4 2023,positive,really liked this movie the animation was beautifuland the characters were really interestingreally cool and smooth villain and a nice ending
Jan 4 2023,positive,an animated masterpiece
Jan 4 2023,positive,surprisingly good rare when a sequel does that
Jan 4 2023,positive,i was skeptical for a plethora of reasons about this movie ive liked the past installments and even the tv series was ok but this movie literally blew me away the story is fantastic the character development is realistic the connections seem are genuine and heartwarming   and the actionoh my godthe choreography of each action piece was outstanding and the handling of each characters strengths and weaknesses were fantastic even the payoffs to goofy plot devices like perrito learning dough eyes was well used the antagonists and villains were so spot on and the bounty hunter arch was amazing the first few scenes were so fantastically done that i didnt think it would keep it up through a few sections but it just kept being amazing   it really feels like the producers were told to just make a good movie and thats what they were done i dont feel the hand of the studio in this at all just an amazingly well done animated film and an absolute see in the theaters experience as well  the low frame rate spiderverse style animation moments made me feel like they were going to try to pointlessly capitalize on that style but they really utilized it to elevate the action sections even using the style to contrast standard animation motion to push parts of the narrative and character development fucking splendid film
Jan 4 2023,neutral,okay not sure why all the hype not great for 3 to 6 year olds the jokes and laughs go right over kids heads i guess thats the point but not for little kids 
Jan 4 2023,positive,loved it death was da truth
Jan 4 2023,positive,went in with zero expectations and left the theater with a smile on my face is not a generic basic kids movie dreamworks understood the value that puss in boots gained over the years and gave the character an evolution we didnt know it needed a strong story filled with valuable messages for the young audiences but without losing the charm of an already wellestablished universe both from the shrek movies and the previous standalone puss in boots film
Jan 4 2023,positive,puss in boots was entertaining funny and family friendly with a little bit for kids and a little bit for adults to enjoy finally a non political non social movie that was just pure fun  would recommend highly
Jan 4 2023,positive,it was cute but not as funny as i hoped for
Jan 4 2023,positive,it was a really good movie
Jan 4 2023,positive,this movie is so fire guys everyone go see it now
Jan 4 2023,positive,i grew up a huge fan of the shrek franchise this film is on par with shrek and shrek 2 there is a shrek and donkey dynamic with puss and boots and another character in the film i wish i could say more but i am scared i would spoil the movie go see it
Jan 4 2023,positive,feel good movie that also shows the dark side of humans well known already to us animal lovers
Jan 4 2023,positive,very funny and the animation was awesome
Jan 4 2023,positive,it was funny great storyline and sweet i enjoyed the movie with my partner  will watch again
Jan 4 2023,positive,i thought itt will be a souless reboot i was dead wrong dreamworks played well with the audio and antagonists were also really good
Jan 4 2023,positive,extremely funny with phenomenal animation  a touching sorry fun characters and complex situations very creative
Jan 4 2023,positive,i went in to this film aware of the fact it was surprisingly good yet a small part of me believed it was just a morbius situation where everyone pretended it was amazing however i was plenty surprised  right from the start you can see how they took the animation from spiderverse but twisted and turned it to create their own version which made the opening fight amazing to watch  the film was somehow able to manage theee villains at once and not one felt too used or under used i will not talk about the third one as from the way the advertisements seem to refrain from mentioning him i get the idea hes meant to be a surprise antag  death himself was one of the greatest villains in animation history even when he only has a few actual confrontations with puss as he perfers to watch from the shadows with his red eyes and honestly horrifying to the bone tune   the other villain is the goldilocks crime family who while at first seemed out of place definitely fit in near the end being a mix of comic relief and evilness while it was quite easy to determine how their story would play out and end they were still a great addition to the story   all in all puss in boots 2 is a great film that isnt scared to go pass the limits of a children film and become actually scary at times while having actual character development for a talking cat
Jan 4 2023,positive,amazing movie definitely better than the first one i all most cried multiple times and the scary scenes where actually scary bruh go watch the movie you wont regret it
Jan 4 2023,positive,cute funny loved it 
Jan 4 2023,positive,it brings another beautiful chapter and character wroth in puss referencing many wonderful movies to an end that made me cry cause of hope

Jan 4 2023,positive,come on disney youre lacking but this movie was awesome  go dreamworks
Jan 4 2023,positive,another banger dream works movie
Jan 4 2023,negative,antonios voice is great as usual the movie was slow i noticed little kids lost interest
Jan 4 2023,positive,this movie was amazing life changing if you will i was raised watching the original puss in boots movie it was so dear to me so when i heard there was going to be a sequel i hoped and hoped it would live up to the expectations of my childhood well it did the animation is beautiful and full of life its colorful and doesnt feel synthetic or corporate like the latest disney movie animation has been the jokes are actually funny there are definitely a few jokes only adults would understand and they used very very mild curse words but it works the dialogue fits the movie in my opinion and i loved how they also used a lot more spainish in this movie they also made sure there wasnt english subtitles so those jokes are only for the spainish speakers in there hehe me included lol the characters were also really good none of them annoyed me which is suprizing because usually in cartoon movies there is some kind of side kick or something that just gets on my nerves but there wasnt any in this movie the character design is one of my favorite aspects of the movie and the jabs at disney were really funny aswell the story also really hit home and made me tear up a bit since i deal with some of the things that were talked about in the movie spoiler mostly pusss anxiety of death and living up to his legend also the therapy dog reminded me of my cat who is kind of like my therapy animal lol anyways the story was 1010 everything was 1010 and i would definitely watch it over and over again and i hope dreamworks continues making great sequels and movies like this

Jan 4 2023,positive,nonstop well done action
Jan 4 2023,positive,i thought it was a interesting fun to watch movie even for an older audience it was clearly not a cashgrab like some other movies recently and was clearly thought out unique storyline and idea the whole concept of death being around following made it also seem to have stakes meaning the characters actions would actually have affect on the future it also wasnt a cringe fest like some other new animated movies are and each character has a unique backstory and reason to want the star watch it i highly recommend it
Jan 4 2023,positive,witty and consistent with other movies and series loved it
Jan 4 2023,positive,the animation and story was awesome we really liked why they did with the animation this movie

Jan 4 2023,positive,this movie had no reason to go as hard as it did but dreamworks is at it again making banger sequels that never miss man would a fantastic film
Jan 4 2023,negative,too much inappropriate language for a kids movie it wasnt necessary and it was all my kids noticed or remembered from the movie
Jan 4 2023,positive,very funny  grandkids loved it
Jan 4 2023,positive,my 3 kids and i absolutely loved this movie besides a few completely unnecessary curse words it was a great movie it was refreshing to take my family to a movie that wasnt politically over the top and annoying
Jan 4 2023,positive,where do i even begin i walked into the theater expecting a mildly interesting action adventure movie about a talking cat wearing boots and i was pleasantly surprised this movie is absolutely amazing and i dont say that lightly for starters the writing for the characters was simply outstanding when i saw that there was many characters i was worried that some of the characters would be tossed to the side a little too easily and that others would receive too much spotlight but no each character had depth and added something interesting to the movie i didnt dislike a single character and not once did i feel like any character underoverstayed their welcome i also enjoyed the humor many movies targeted towards children nowadays just use crude unfunny humor to try to appeal kids but this movie is actually funny the jokes dont feel forced and i found myself audibly laughing at many gags the animation left me speechless it was incredible not a second of screen time was wasted and every frame was vibrant and full of life some scenes you could see every hair on pusss face and on others unshed tears glistening in his eyes the style was definitely inspired by spiderman into the spiderverse but didnt feel like a copy the film takes that comic book style and warps it into its very own unique version the paintbrush aesthetic adds so much color and depth to each scene giving the viewers some amazing scenery the fight scenes were action packed and well choreographed during many of them especially during pusss final fight with death i could feel my heart pounding in anticipation will he win will he loose the fights keep you entertained and on your toes its outrageously good while the plot felt a little simple it feels intentional so that the movie can focus more on the compelling characters and settings the forest where most of the movie takes place is such an interesting concept the landscape changing depending on who was holding the map led to some great animation and ideas the movie took a huge risk with three main antagonists and it thankfully pulls it off well i adored goldilocks relationship with the three bears and her emotional inner turmoil was a great addition to the story i also enjoyed john mulaneys role as jack horner and while he did feel like the weakest villain he makes up for it by being incredibly funny i dont even know how to describe the third antagonist the wolf who was the embodiment of death the wolf was genuinely scary his bright red eyes standing out against the darker tones of the scenes he was in was so visually pleasing watching death himself stalk puss the entire movie was chilling and compelling from the very moment he appeared on screen i could tell he was going to be one of the best parts of the movie watching puss run away from the fight and have a full blown panic attack in the woods truly showed the audience just how much of a threat the wolf was the movie didnt treat the wolf like a joke and didnt present him lightly he is death i dont mean that metaphorically or rhetorically or poetically or theoretically or any other fancy way he is death this review is crazy long and i am starting to ramble so i will end this with an overall rating     humor 9510  characters 9510  plot 810  animation 1010  overall 9510    i strongly recommend watching this movie it is 100 worth the watch it is a great movie to let loose and forget about boring day to day life too let yourself be immersed in the colorful compelling world with fun meaningful characters great music funny jokes and amazing animation
Jan 4 2023,positive,enjoyable family movie
Jan 4 2023,positive,its geat its almost best move i have seen in my opinion dreamwork respect

Jan 3 2023,positive,it is unbelieveable how good this movie is if thats the future of animation its gonna be a good one
Jan 3 2023,positive,its wonderful    i like the conceit of two cats and a dog traveling together learning from one another at first the cats crafty combative suspicious cannot believe how gullible and foolish this ridiculous dog is but in time they learn to be a little more doglike trusting and affectionate and he learns to be a little more catlike savvy and discerning its nice     i like the physical gags eg where the anthropomorphic puss in boots reverts to his base feline nature i like the character design of goldilocks and the three bears i think its visually beautiful much of the time    most of all i love the bold thoreauean message beautifully manifested into a literal fight sequence at the end of the film that we must learn to cherish defend and embrace with passion and without fear the one short and precious life we have and stop passively wasting our time away wishing for an easy fix
Jan 3 2023,positive,i went to this movie with my wife very optimistic and left telling everyone i could think of that this is the best movie ever if it isnt that it is the best feel good movie ever i got home and started looking for a team friendship tshirt and couldnt find one if i dont find one soon i will start selling them and will be rich this movie is awesome
Jan 3 2023,positive,good message about life values
Jan 3 2023,positive,dreamworks has debuted great villains in the past but this might be their greatest villain on screen yet combine spectacular humor for children and adults with a shockingly deep message and you get this movie the wolf antagonist and thought provoking message of the film alone more than earn the current 95 score rt gave it please go see this adults and children alike wont be disappointed
Jan 3 2023,positive,beautiful animation great character dynamic action scenes and a mature story one of dreamworks bests

Jan 3 2023,positive,i had not seen any of the other puss in boots movies so i was a bit skeptical that i would like it but this was such a cute movie the storyline was so creative and kept us captivated the whole time highly recommend even if you havent seen any other puss in boots movies

Jan 3 2023,positive,the animation was bad at times a little too long and one of the villains was over the top other than really enjoyed myself
Jan 3 2023,positive,good movie for little kids
Jan 3 2023,positive,i rarely hand out five stars but this film overachieves in every category i recommend it to anyone who is at least vaguely familiar with the character its innocent fun and an amazing story with villains that make you laugh cry and shake in your seat one of the villains is a bit scary for younger audiences so i recommend checking the maturity level of your child before buying a ticket however the scary character is by far some of the best parts of the movie so do not let that drive you away
Jan 3 2023,positive,i was not expecting it to be this good animation plot character writing and absolutely everything else was so enjoyable i absolutely recommend it to anyone who enjoys animation as much as me   possible spoiler below for those who wanna go in completely blind    i feel like cat ladys house scene was bit too long but im not making it lose a score over it because actual adventure makes up for it by being amazing from start to finish
Jan 3 2023,positive,great writing its fun and funny while at the same time without getting too emotional touches on the themes of battling death and makes you think about what is important in life
Jan 3 2023,positive,i really loved the movie its great for kids but also has a few scenes that adults may like to if you arent an avid movie watcher you may not follow very well but still great

Jan 3 2023,positive,animation is fresh  loved the new takes on classic nursery stories especially the goldilocks subplot
Jan 3 2023,positive,one of the best animated movies i have seen in a while every frame of the movie was so well made every second was entertaining and every character was interesting i have literally no problems with it after watching it i just wanted to watch it again one of the only animated movies i laugh out loud so much i probably disturbed the people in the theater lol
Jan 3 2023,negative,not kid friendly crude boring save your money
Jan 3 2023,positive,very entertaining wouldve given 5 stars but it was a little scary at times for my 4 year old but overall we loved it
Jan 3 2023,positive,enjoyed it it was funny suspenseful and heartfelt
Jan 3 2023,positive,this movie was really awesome would recommend families to see dreamworks tried something different in there sequel for puss in boots and they nailed it the animation the pacing and the villians are just spot on death was a really good villian and would be in my top 5 favorite dream work villians besides all of that you guys need to see it
Jan 3 2023,positive,great story  lots of action liked all of the characters  this was very enjoyable for my son and i
Jan 3 2023,positive,too noisy and chaotic too disorienting for smaller children funny thing was i liked it better than the three grandkids did 12 8 and 4 yo
Jan 3 2023,negative,darkdeath is a scary wolf chasing puss throughout the movie  this alone makes this movie inappropriate for little kids  not fun
Jan 3 2023,positive,awesome conclusion to the puss character from the shrek universe due to the appearance of death plus some minor profanity this film might not be appropriate for younger kids
Jan 3 2023,positive,very exciting and humorous
Jan 3 2023,positive,how do i even get started with how extraordinary and awesome this movie is it was beyond everybodys expectations in all aspects the animation art style action story characters and development was top notch but what so impressive about this movie that stood out to me was the immense depth meaning and emotions ingrained inside it this movie isnt just a kids film it has deep spiritual meaning and i am sitting there blown away by the scenes and wondering if anybody else is getting it too   the character death is a manifestation of pusss fear and anxiety collected over his past lives in this journey his old identity went through a whole breakthrough and he had to face his fear which he has avoided for all his lives it was pretty summed like a dark of night the soul then there was the character perrito which really shines through the story whom was the exact epitome of innocence joy and purity even after going through such a tremendous sorrows he was still vastly unaffected and is able to keep an attitude of unwavering positivity and lightheartedness that truly is a character of enlightened nature i feel that his had so much to teach all of us that despite whatever that happens to us it was perception that created our reality
Jan 3 2023,positive,funny and sad at times   awesome movie  i look forward to continuing with shrek and co
Jan 3 2023,positive,the movie had great animation and characters but there were some moments that didnt seem to fit in the movie
Jan 3 2023,positive,i made a rotten tomatoes account just to gush about how phenomenal this movie is not only is it stunning visually but the story tackles incredibly deep and profound topics i never would have expected a puss in boots sequel of all things to be about panic and anxiety and existential dread every character is given just enough development for the purpose they serve without feeling like they are overdeveloping someone or ignoring someone who needed more depth for the part they play this movie was full of characters and the fact that they managed to somehow neatly place them all into the story baffles me as an aspiring writer the wolf is obviously incredible and horrifying his presence mixed with pusss fear amazingly brought to life by the character animation puts you right into the scene with them even perrito is a fantastic addition to the cast making him the only character who frequently curses is a hilarious subversion i also think that jack horner is really funny i havent seen him talked about as much but i find his irredeemably cruel personality really great especially since it fits the whole death theme of the movie please go see it in theatres i could go on and on about every aspect but its better if you see it yourself
Jan 3 2023,positive,i know what youre thinking puss in boots 2 the sequel to that mediocre movie about the funny little cat from shrek that came out over a decade ago my entire family laughed at me when i told them i was going to see puss in boots 2 in the theater but please trust me when i say that this movie is a masterpiece for kids and adults equally nothing i say can prepare you for how unironically and extraordinarily good this film is i cannot believe it hasnt even grossed a tenth of what avatar the way of water has worldwide we need to support this movie so that dreamworks understands that we see it and that we want more like it    on the surface it may seem like a quaint little movie about puss and the frankly generic heros struggle with overcoming an inflated ego but its so much more than that without giving away too much puss in boots the last wish dives headfirst into very emotionally mature topics in a way that i seldom see in movies animated or otherwise throughout the film puss grapples with the reality of mortality and its genuinely terrifying and impactful    i feel like this movie really showed off how animation is a medium that deserves respect there are some aspects of this movie that just wouldnt work in a liveaction film and i adore that the exaggerated anatomy during fight scenes a certain redeyed wolf villain and the incredible character acting are all things that i cant imagine being executed as flawlessly as they did in the limitless medium of animation the painterly brush strokes in the environment and characters really fit the fairytale genre i was just blown away by the beauty packed in every single frame    the fact that the pacing was so flawless despite there being 3 main villains and 3 main protagonists to give appropriate amounts of screentime was absolutely insane at no point did it feel like we spent too long or too little on one character and everyones motives and actions felt incharacter justified and well thought out to me this is what cinema is this is what its all about not a wasted shot not a wasted line not a wasted second perfect intention in every moment every second is dense with beautiful visuals and rich storytelling
Jan 3 2023,positive,the best animated film for 2022 trust me 
Jan 3 2023,positive,very enjoyable movie so good and the villain is perfect
Jan 3 2023,positive,whats weird was i honestly didnt see too much promotion for this movie so it made me a little worried upon going in what i instead got to witness was a fun emotional adventure thats clawed its way in to my heart from beautiful animation to beautiful performances from the actors and actresses delivering a story that deserves a spot on anyone shelf its easily become one of my favorites that i cant wait to own just to experience it again and again its truly a beautiful movie with heart that i havent seen in a little while cant wait to see it again
Jan 3 2023,negative,this movie is poorly rated for kids in appropriate humor remarks and extremely  dark for a childrens movie we had a large group of about 9 kids ranging from 213 that watched each one had mixed feelings from being afraid to feeling uncomfortable and generally disappointed  definitely will not watch another movie from this franchise after this
Jan 3 2023,positive,wasnt quite as funny as the first movie i loved the action scenes in the movie as well as the story line

Jan 3 2023,positive,i really enjoyed this movie with my kids it was really good and funny
Jan 3 2023,positive,the animation films of recent have been too safe they dont risk much and therefore earn decent rewards in the box office  this movie however was an incredible risk reviving an 11year dead franchise with a mediocre spinoff franchises sequel film thats nearly unheard of and somehow they made it work  the last wish is the greatest representation of anxiety and ptsd i have ever encountered and thats coming from someone with an anxiety disorder pusss anxiety attack was so real his fear blinded him and the comfort of those he was near to helped him through such a traumatic experience  again the revival of the shrek universe wasnt something i was looking forward to but dreamworks brought their agame the vibrant animation style enticing soundtrack wellwritten characters and beautiful story is amazing  9510 watched twice and tempted to go for a third expect me on opening night for shrek 5

Jan 2 2023,positive,an all around amazing experience right up there with shrek 2 as dreamworks absolute best     the way this movie perfectly blends its mature themes with comedy without allowing them to intrude on one another is simply masterful and the performances from the entire cast are absolutely amazing the animation very clearly also takes quite a large amount of inspiration from spiderverse in all the right ways with the fight scenes especially looking absolutely superb an absolute must watch

Jan 2 2023,positive,one of the greatest kids animated movies ever
Jan 2 2023,positive,loved it antonio banderas never gets old the new nursery rhyme references are great  makes me wonder if kids now know who mother goose and the assorted cast of characters in her book are so they will get the humor i hope so i might not take a 5 year old because of the death character not enough context for them to understand but for older peeps its funny and is a great feel good movie
Jan 2 2023,positive,such a fun movie literally for adults and kids the humor is top tier and the action scenes go harder than i expected  even the vulnerable and dark moments were handled in a way that anyone could understand without even trying a must see and definitely a must watch again for those that have the opportunity to

Jan 2 2023,positive,i liked the animation during the fight scenes
Jan 2 2023,positive,thought it was a great movie different stories with their own different motives which doesnt feel forced characters are good without making them overbearing or annoying and the scenes and atmosphere hits the spots though be warned as it has some scary scenes not like horror movies of scary but a bit frightening so would recommend to watch it as a family if there are small kids present otherwise ignore that part definitely watch it and would recommend it again
Jan 2 2023,positive,the wolf was too scary when he whistled and his creepy eyes the story line was cute and the dog we liked his part of the story

Jan 2 2023,positive,i think it is one of the best movies of 2022 the story progresses in a nice and entertaining way with a plot characters and animation that catch you from the first minute
Jan 2 2023,positive,i dont even have kids but i still went to watch it
Jan 2 2023,positive,puss in boots the last wish is an absolute masterpiece never before have i ever been compelled to review a movie before but this film was so good that i just had praise it people need to go see it in theaters so that it succeeds in the box office dreamworks needs to make more films like this one    spoilers below    first off the animation is stunning its stylized similar to spiderverse but with its own flair it has a very pastel like feel to it which greatly compliments the fairy tale theme  the action is top notch they purposely lower the frame rate during high action scenes it helps to exaggerate the look of fast motion and lets you feel the weight of blow the choreography is great the very first fight scene is very reminiscent of levi fighting the titan on the rooftops in attack on titan and the action only gets better from there  this movie has not a single bad character somehow even the dog who youd think would be annoying ended up being genuinely heartwarming and has funny moments never during the film was i disappointed to cut away to a different character because they were all good and all had an appropriate amount of screen time the character arcs were compelling the villains were incredible ill get back to the villains not a single second of this film was spent on a character that brought down the experience  this film has a lot of villains you would think that with that many villains to juggle the film would miss the mark but no it all balances out quite nicely and theyre all distinctly different from each other jack horner is a hilariously irredeemable crime boss goldilocks and the three bears have a genuinely heartwarming message and the wolf is by far the best animated villain i have ever seen maybe even the best villain period if you have small children this might not be a good film for them because the wolf is scary and i dont mean that metaphorically poetically rhetorically theoretically or any of that i mean he is straight up scary  this movies themes about death and making the best of the time you have left on this earth is handled really really well and maturely it has puss having to come to grips that one day he will die now that hes on his last life since cats have nine lives he has the fear death in him seeing him grow and realize that death comes for us all and accepting that feels like a major and well deserved accomplishment  while i absolutely adore this film there are a couple cautionary warnings that i feel i have to express about this movie while it is advertised for kids it has a lot of darker themes suggested swearing morbid humor and an intense villain that parents may not want to expose their younger children to that said if you think youre child is old or mature enough to handle some somewhat more intense themes and action then this is a movie that both the parents and the kids will enjoy  1010 stars go watch this movie
Jan 2 2023,positive,absolutely fantastic best animated movie of the year by far even though its a pg movie it doesnt baby the audience at all and there are some real and heart touching themes that all ages can relate to and get behind it is also absolutely hilarious     every character is extremely well written for the roles they play in the film and the main antagonist is a new top tier dreamworks villain the stylization of the art and animation is fantastic as well the best movie from the shrek universe since shrek 2 in my opinion overall a great movie
Jan 2 2023,positive,not a bad movie but zero humor  if you are expecting to laugh like you did for shrek you will be disappointed  storyline felt a bit forced   the animation is very cgi ish not the natural animation i prefer  the lack of humor is my main complaint
Jan 2 2023,positive,the theater has amazing screens and the movie was so cute and funny just loved it 
Jan 2 2023,positive,good movie to watch with the kids
Jan 2 2023,positive,nice family friendly movie the children and parents can enjoy together fun story lines which everyone could follow too
Jan 2 2023,positive,loved it i have a mid expectation for this movie but instead i get a pure treats    theyre taking more liberties in animation and color styles in this sequel one of the new thing i realized is they lowered the frame rate and exaggerated the animations during the action scene which makes it more cartoony but enjoyable    the less desired things are the plot is a bit too predictable offering not much surprises and the film run time is too short to my liking    still overall loved it
Jan 2 2023,positive,first half was like mediocre film good for children but the second half was very very good animation is beautiful and consistent throughout
Jan 2 2023,positive,had low expectationsbut puss delivered again the storyline was fresh a quick moving and the new characters were awesome especially the wolf and associated animation was really excellent movies in theatre are alive and wellhopefully making a comeback

Jan 1 2023,positive,i watched the movie 2 times not only beacouse i think puss in boots the last wish is not only better than shrek 2 not only bettter than any dreamworks movie but one of my top 3 animated movies and one of top 10 movies in general i also wanted to go second time to support dreamworks which is extremely underrated and my favourite animation studio i think its the best animated movie since like idk more than 10 years definitely recomend watching im in love with this movie currently and i dont think 5 start is enough beacouse its a 1110 movie but there is a problem with this movie its too short i mean it was perfect for what it is but if it was like 2h it would be my favourite animated movie ever and the top 3 are practically the same at ranking so if it was longer it would be a perfect movie
Jan 1 2023,positive,the animation quality was superb great attention to details however the story was just average nothing stood out my favorite character had to be perrito i wanted him to come home with me
Jan 1 2023,positive,the previews looked good but the movie was awesome well rounded movie that has everything a movie should have highly recommend this movie
Jan 1 2023,positive,this movie was a 1010 for me th animation was exellent the wolf was a perfect and antagonist i loved to see kitty return and i liked perito to the fact shrek 5 was probably teased make me hyped  dreamworks never disapoint
Jan 1 2023,positive,took my kids and i had never seen any of the previous puss in boots movies or show my daughter saw everything prior and my son only knew of puss from the shrek movie this was one of those movies that was still fun for parents to watch they do say hell and insinuate other swear words like bull shhhhhh if that matters to you but it went over my kids heads  it starts out a little slow but by the end of the movie i was anxiously waiting to find out what was going to happen  this movie was a refreshing one because it wasnt painful for parents to have to sit through
Jan 1 2023,positive,holy moly this was a beautiful movie  theres so much to say about puss in boots 2 the visuals were amazing the choppy animation that kicked in whenever a battle started made the movie even cooler the story was absolutely brilliant death being the villain puss is running away from the cinematography on many of the frames were spectacular everything about the movie was beautiful especially the scene where puss has a panic attack due to death chasing after him and perrito comforting him i dont know why but i felt like i was gonna cry because it was such raw and realistic representation of anxiety disorders and panic attacks as a person who suffers from gad every character was so interesting and i never felt like their presence onscreen was a waste of time this is one of the best modern movies coming from dreamworks and should i say one of the best animated films that came out this year probably even better than gdts pinnochio which im also a big fan of please watch this movie its so good i swear
Jan 1 2023,positive,we enjoyed it 3 12 said parts were scary but he sat and watched it all
Jan 1 2023,positive,i was pleasantly surprised with this movie well developed character arcs created an exciting story not just for the main feline hero but his fellow partners the art style for the animation was well used and made the entire story feel like a moving storybook fantastic film best in the series
Jan 1 2023,positive,it totally enthralled my granddaughter
Jan 1 2023,negative,awful not for kids
Jan 1 2023,positive,what a movie where should i start it tells a story of an arrogant selfish adventurer whose ego and carelessness led to him burning through 8 of his 9 lives then going on a quest to get them back and along the way learns that he doesnt have to be the legend always alone always being selfcentered and egotistical puss goes on a journey to the wishing star which will grant one wish to whoever gets to it first he is joined by perrito a dog who despite being treated like crap all of his life is very upbeat and happy and just a little too trusting for his own good and he meets back up with kitty softpaws his old flame with some understandable trust issues but they are not alone in the search for the wishing star because there are 3 main baddies after our feline hero first is little jack horner or rather big jack horner a giant psychopath bent on getting all the magic in the world next is goldielocks and the three bears crime family a smashandgrab operation and a real family as they took goldie in and made her a part of their family and finally no fairy tale would be complete without wolf who may be more than just a bounty hunter the movie is good its really good its really incredibly really good the character development has really advanced in this movie the story has some serious messages while also having lighthearted moments they even swear in the moviedont worry the really bad ones are bleeped outyes the bleep sound effect is in the movie after 11 years the legend has returned hes back and better than ever the character arcs are beautiful with puss kitty and perrito all going through noticeable changes throughout the entire movie and there is a subplot with goldie and the bears and kitty too involving themes of family and trust respectively the movie doesnt dumb down the themes not laying them out like a thanksgiving banquet it shows the themes instead of telling them big jack horner was a genuinely funny villain and even though he didnt have his own character arc he was no less of a villain than the others over the movie is exceptionallygreat with amazing animation fun and complex the stories are very compelling with themes that are shown instead of told like fear of death appreciating your life what family really means
Jan 1 2023,positive,amazing cartoon painting style and my nostalgia the films is capturing every things from story line characteristic unigue adventures animation purpose of enemy drama and humors  and the most i love it is the wolf death that stalking and haunt puss then the whisper is the iconic of wolf amazing movie great job dream works

Jan 1 2023,negative,the dizzy drawcard of animation mesh up just doesnt sit well with the lovable main character and the movie is far too violent for younger viewers a few laughs and well timed bleeps could not save this movie from being one step away from a white hot mess
Jan 1 2023,positive,great story animation music perfect all around
Jan 1 2023,negative,very violent and nightmarish dont take young kids to see

Jan 1 2023,negative,violence from beginning to end  wolf  character way to scary for young children  plus plot for movie was also too deep for young kids  story was jumping all over the place  but mostly to intense scary for young kids  just awful
Jan 1 2023,positive,this is the most fun ive had with a movie in a while the animation and style of this movie is beautiful and the action is fun and exciting the story is about overcoming fear and mortality they discuss these themes well which is quite special for a movie catered to kids one of the characters is pretty basic and annoying but gets a bit better they couldve done more with this character keeping this movie from having a perfect rating for me i would definitely watch it again soon though

Dec 31 2022,positive,its been a long time since ive laughed so hard and out loud at the movies very cleverly written riffing off of several fairy tales and nursery rhymes i seriously doubt the grade schoolers and preteens that were there caught even a fraction of the jokes that us adults winked and nodded at
Dec 31 2022,positive,i liked the puppy  it was cute
Dec 31 2022,negative,i went for the popcorn the cgi is interesting from an art perspective they used a cool technique during the fight scenes the runtime is 140 and its about 120 too long goldilocks and big jack are the most interesting characters the story starts slow and didnt hold my interest after a 12 hour kids will probably like it
Dec 31 2022,positive,way better than the first installement of the franchise i loved the pacing as well as the villain which absolutely terrified me even though this is a kids movie i loved this movie so much i might want to watch it again in theaters
Dec 31 2022,positive,the animations top notch the story engrossing and gripping as puss struggles with his first true fear of death it really feels like a love letter to all the kind of fun adventure stories puss in boots represents and the enjoyable fairy tale fun of the shrek franchise in general i just had a truly great time

Dec 31 2022,positive,the movie theater i went to was flix brewhouse and they overcharged us for our popcorn they charged us for two you couldnt hear anything they said the movie was great but the service being overcharged is not something you want to have happen at a movie theater

Dec 31 2022,positive,best new animated movie ive seen in years a great tale of life age and family i saw it in spanish will probably watch in english too great film
Dec 31 2022,positive,this is truly one of the best movies to come out this year and thats not only in the animation category let me tell you this movie does an excellent job at developing and maturing puss into a character i would love to see again soon along with the supporting cast reintroduced in this film the villain has to be one of the best dreamworks have ever done where they might send a chill down your spine everytime they appear on screen the action animation dialogue story and characters all go so amazingly well together that i cannot express it enough this movie is all i have thought about the past day after seeing it and just cause of that i might go see it again due to it being so amazing in the movie it covers deep subjects and ideas kids may not understand to the fullest like with anxiety death and growing up or maturing fully but of course it is a family movie in the end and it needs to be seen
Dec 31 2022,positive,entertaining great story for youngsters

Dec 31 2022,positive,typical animation poor story lineno imaginationself ingratiating to latino culture  you can do better with guardians of the galaxy
Dec 31 2022,positive,in my perspective it is a film with a very good plot recommended without a doubt for children lovers of this type of animation different from the usual taking certain films as a reference and for lovers of sherk although that is not possible the pair of sherk 1 or 2

Dec 31 2022,positive,this movie is one of the best animated movies ive seen since spider verse this is one of the greatest movies ever to come out in 2022 the voice acting the visuals it all comes together to create a masterpiece the dark and depressing tone that can become all colorful sweet and vibrant is perfect the music when death comes on screen with his whistling is spine chilling this makes the movie great for 10 and older audiences but i think younger kids need to watch this we need more stuff like this movie

Dec 30 2022,positive,terrific cast great script that appeals to both kids and adults
Dec 30 2022,positive,i thought this movie was going to be child like but the whole concept of the movie was death which in my opinion was so great it also made me cry a little if youre an adult you should def still see this super enjoyable puts things into perspective for you

Dec 30 2022,positive,it was an awesome movie a good family film that everyone can enjoy my 2 year old loved it and so did we
Dec 30 2022,positive,we super duper loved the movie 
Dec 30 2022,positive,i just saw the movie today an i thought that this movie was awesome an i love the animation an all of the characters in the movie this has to be on of the most fire movies ive ever seen 
Dec 30 2022,positive,funny with a good moral  making you stop and know what is really important in your life
Dec 30 2022,positive,this movie was fabulous wellwritten actionpacked funny touching and just overall a treat
Dec 30 2022,positive,i liked the story line
Dec 30 2022,positive,absolutely amazing movie one of the best i have seen in the last years the scary scenes are very well done and show what a realistic anxiety attack looks like as the viewer i felt really immersed in the movie the comedy is nice the animation is gorgeous and the action scenes are freaking cool a movie that kids and adults can enjoy
Dec 30 2022,positive,great movie kids were laughing parents were laughing everyone enjoyed the movie
Dec 30 2022,positive,great movie 3d format was outstanding so would the standard format also kept you on your toes and kept interest peeking
Dec 30 2022,positive,being a fan of the shrek franchise i could not pass up the newest entry  while puss in boots  the last wish does have its problems it is still a very well made and entertaining movie  antonio banderas is perfect as the voice of the title character  salma hayek is terrific also as the voice of kitty softpaws  the supporting characters are clever and well done  the character of perrito voiced by harvey guillen is also a welcome addition to the long list of comic sidekicks we see in these types of movies  one other highlight is the character of death voiced by wagner moura  the writers on this movie handeled the character very well  the resolution with the character was quite good  my only criticism of the movie is its rather formulaic storyline  in the beginning of the movie puss only thinks of himself and could not care less about anybody else  however in time he comes to realize his selfishness is wrong and he needs to change his attitudes towards others  nothing we have not seen before  however this minor flaw is made up for by a well done climactic fight sequence  it has just the right amount of thrills and does not become too drawn out or overblown  over two decades after shrek dreamworks is still able to keep the franchise going with some good entertainment  if you are a shrek fan as i am i think you would like puss in boots  the last wish
Dec 30 2022,negative,this movie is not for young kids
Dec 30 2022,positive,too much violence for kids
Dec 30 2022,positive,great family movie my kids ages range between 12 and 6 and they all loved it everyone had a favorite part my favorite character is perrito the dog too funny and cute
Dec 30 2022,positive,it was a cute movie very entertaining with some adult humor to keep us interested would recommend to those who follow the shrek movies
Dec 30 2022,positive,the movie packs a load of really heart tugging messages in its just shy of 2 hour run time  many of the young children will probably not sense the messages but that is ok because the action scenes and storyline will keep them entertained  as for the adults you will find yourself reflecting on quite a few of those messages  the combination of comedy and action are evenly dispersed  i highly recommend this delightful film for all ages
Dec 30 2022,positive,great movie loved it for kids
Dec 30 2022,positive,fast paced lots of comedy and surprises a good feel family movie and no vulgar language
Dec 30 2022,positive,i saw this with my daughter and i had no idea what it was really about i love the shrek franchise and all of its spinoffs this move it stellar 55 even if youre an adult its very good the humor is a great mix of adult and child alike and even the childlike jokes were constructed well enough not to be cheap i would highly recommend this to anyone and ive already done just that to my friends
Dec 30 2022,positive,is very funny and very interesting
Dec 30 2022,positive,great movie can be enjoyed by any age good plot interesting storyline and a whole lot of cuteness
Dec 30 2022,positive,went to see this with my husband who isnt too keen on animated films needless to say i enjoyed it very much but surprisingly so did he puss in boots 2 is marvelous in terms of animation anyone with eyes and a bit of creativity couldve seen that however the story and characters really sink in just how much love and effort was put into this film puss is the perfect depiction of growing out of who you once were into something better coming to terms with the fact that you need to cherish the one life you have with the ones you love the pacing is just right with only one moment in the beginning feeling just a tad bit drawn out overall we had a lot of fun watching this film and finding our own ways to connect with the different characters in the film i highly recommend this movie to everyone and we will definitely be watching it again
Dec 30 2022,positive,an amazing masterpiece of a movie but i think it lacked nods to the first one
Dec 30 2022,positive,not always a huge fan of animated films however i took my grandkids5 8 and 12 and we all absolutely loved this film   its funnyreally funny heartwarmingloved the animation and especially loved puss and boots and his precious little dog friend  well madeeven for adults
Dec 30 2022,positive,my daughter and i loved the movie
Dec 30 2022,positive,lovely movie amazing animation style which resembles spiderman into the spiderverse while keeping true to the shrek fantasy world great fight scenes and lovely for all ages
Dec 30 2022,positive,disliked swear words and bleeping of swear words  not good for intended audience granddaughter says it was funny  she like the characters in the story
Dec 30 2022,positive,i brought 2 11year olds and we really enjoyed it  it was a very good story
Dec 30 2022,positive,i loved how my grandsons figured it out and laughed
Dec 30 2022,positive,i love it  it was so good
Dec 30 2022,positive,puss in boots the last wish is as spry and light on its feet as its titular feline the inherently alluring paradox of the swashbuckling kitty from the shrek universe remains firmly in place 11 years after his first solo feature hes a dashing adventurer a charmer with the ladies feared and renowned throughout the land  but hes also unbearably adorable as he laps up milk from a shot glass with his pinky sandpapery tongue as always the charismatic and sensitive antonio banderas finds just the right tone in exploring this furry animated figures suave and silly sides the last wish expands the roster of ridiculously talented supporting players from the oscarnominated 2011 original puss in boots joining banderas and his longtime friend and costar salma hayek pinault are florence pugh olivia colman ray winstone davine joy randolph and john mulaney among many others they bring a surprising amount of substance to what might have been a purely playful endeavor but of course the fastpaced humor and elaborate visuals are the main draws of director joel crawford and codirector januel mercados film the films aesthetics may rely too heavily on anime influences especially during the action sequences but the vibrant colors and rich textures are a delight from the moss growing on a fearsome forest giant to the shiny silkiness of puss whiskers blowing in the wind the last wish offers a variety of eyepopping details and it frequently features dramatic shadows and subtle dissolves to transition from past to present or one scene to the next but the film also manages to convey messages of selflessness and teamwork in a way that doesnt feel heavyhanded or cloying and the stellar voice performances and dazzling visuals keep things so engaging you wont need a laser pointer or a catnipstuffed mouse toy to entertain you
Dec 30 2022,positive,i thought it was very entertaining for adults and kids  some learning experiences were included   very cute and enjoyable movie
Dec 30 2022,positive,loved the adult humor
Dec 30 2022,positive,fantastic movie amazing fight scenes and amazing characters
Dec 30 2022,positive,it is the best dreamworks movie its so good that i dont have any words to say about it its just perfect
Dec 30 2022,positive,loved the animation and voice acting i also were so happy because of the shrek references bring us the  shrek 5
Dec 30 2022,positive,yo this movie is kinda funny and cool
Dec 30 2022,positive,a wellmade film and nice to watch  just its not quite funny at all this is very disappointing for a film in the tradition of shrek
Dec 30 2022,positive,fun imaginative and surprisingly thoughtful story  character development and pacing are really well covered highly recommended
Dec 30 2022,positive,so good laughter and tears with this one teamfriendship
Dec 30 2022,positive,so much fun beautiful animation work need more movies like this you can tell how much time went into it lovely story for people of all ages too
Dec 30 2022,positive,the movie entertained with cleverness and wit while instilling true values and life lessons
Dec 30 2022,negative,nice effects  to much action with no meaning  first movie was far superior in everyday especially the story  this movie was forgettable   wait for it on your streaming service
Dec 30 2022,positive,overall while i cant say i had loads of laughoutloud moments in this film like i enjoyed in the previous instalment or the shrek franchises im proud to say i found this sequel went deeper darker and more adventurous than expected fans will see the adorable puss at his worst but also at his strongest which i loved experiencing on the big screen voice work is a knockout and the animation style feels like a classic fairy tale book coming to life for most of the duration which is a nice magical touch some younger audiences might be a little frightened by some dark tones this animated film strikes strongly and positively like a fresh glass of cool milk
Dec 30 2022,positive,fun movie for kids and adults
Dec 30 2022,positive,oh my god this movie is absolutely stunning  the animation the acting  the character development friendship with shen has ended spoiler is now my best friend    this movie is a mustsee in my opinion it rivals that of shrek fucking t w o
Dec 30 2022,positive,loved the animation and the sorely was different them the prior movies lots of funny parts and not only kid friendly but also adult friendly
Dec 30 2022,positive,very entertaining movie  not very long and good amount of action and humor
Dec 30 2022,positive,on impulse i started to applaud at the start of the end credits the 34 full house at a 330 thursday matinee in downtown seattle heartily joined in suffice to say this film is a crowd pleaser
Dec 30 2022,negative,such a dark movie if i had little kids with me it would scare them  expected a light hearted funny movie which i didnt get actually left the movie when the dog described how he was put in a sack with a rock and thrown in water
Dec 30 2022,positive,i liked the movies meaning thought it was a little loud
Dec 30 2022,positive,fast moving and entertaining especially for our grandchildren age 6 and 8
Dec 30 2022,positive,it was so good nothing will compare to the original but it was laughter the whole movie and it had moments that tugged on your heart strings so much action will have you screaming holy frijoles
Dec 30 2022,positive,loved seeing the cat in action again
Dec 30 2022,negative,to be fair the animation was great and there was some moments that made me laugh and the moral of the story of realizing what you have in front of you was noted  but it did make me sad to think this is all parents have to choose from when taking little kids to the theater  the scale of scariness and dark characters tipped over in my opinion for younger viewers and unfortunately the good moral may be lost in the sea of scariness  one little girl who is 5 was telling me how scared she was of the wolf and didnt want to see the movie ever again and of blood on the cat  its all she could recount from the story line and i guarantee it is a one and done viewing for her  no interest in seeing renting it or wanting any merchandise from it  im glad my kids are grown now  but when they were younger the movies we took them to were ones that inspired them and they found characters they wanted to be like and theyd watch the movie no joke 20 times or more  i wish for those kind of characters again for this next generation of you g kids  not ones that keep them up all night with the lights on
Dec 30 2022,positive,good story very creative
Dec 30 2022,positive,john mulaney is so good and so funny and i would kiss florence pugh because she is stunning love them both animation was weird
Dec 30 2022,positive,great movie entertaining start to finish 
Dec 30 2022,positive,movie was fantastic and theres a lot of things that go over kids heads that had me dying lot of cussing in spanish 
Dec 30 2022,positive,its was good  for family makes believe in wishing come true
Dec 30 2022,positive,i liked the creativity of puss in boots in how they weaved fairy tales and rhymes into the story  i loved the moral story it was telling about the importance of family friends and facing our fears and facing death
Dec 30 2022,positive,antonio and salma keep the fairy tales alive in this great action comedy
Dec 30 2022,positive,i could see where children would get afraid watching it the wolf after puss and boots
Dec 30 2022,positive,funny and entertaining
Dec 30 2022,positive,the movie overall was fine typical but to me it is for older children 89 it may be too much for younger children there are some not so subliminal cursing moments and the death character definitely has some rather scary scenes and there are moments of strong animation violence
Dec 30 2022,positive,our family thoroughly enjoyed the creative storyplot and the awesome animation that would subtly change during the action sequences to resemble comic book sequences antonio banderas voiceover acting as puss was hilarious and spot on no one else could ever do equal justice the only thing i was slightly surprised about was how dark some moments were for an animated family film i have older kids with the youngest aged 8 and he was fine but for some younger kids some of the imagery may be a little on the  scary side still we enjoyed and would watch again

Dec 29 2022,positive,i took my grandkids ages 6 and 8 and they loved it and so did i
Dec 29 2022,positive,puss in boots  the last wish is an unexpected surprise that only provides great animation solid voice actor but also a deep character study for puss character this film talks about a lot of heavy things such as fear loneliness love family and death which is something i was not expecting in a puss in boots film this film made it to my top 5 movies of the year and i highly recommend it to everyone    just a quick warning though this movie can be quite scary for the younger audience members and there is one character in particular that can be pretty terrifying for them so if youre a parent just keep on the look out for that
Dec 29 2022,positive,animation is very nice and fun to look at the story is very hilarious because of how dark it can get the dog side character is surprisingly very charming and funny characters are great and not boring whatsoever the wolf is a great antagonist and keeps you interested i highly recommend this movie i really want this to perform well so we can have dream works movies like this in the future

Dec 29 2022,positive,wow feels very different from the other puss films and shrek when the actions starts the characters switch to animating on 2s and looks more handdrawn like into the spiderverse which probably influenced it
Dec 29 2022,positive,im a 23 year old man who can only really be brought to the theater for action and war movies this movie was one of the best movies ive seen in recent memory not a single complaint about any part of the movie animation was great story was great run time was perfect dialogue was phenomenal jokes landed even for adults go see this movie in theaters for all that is good and holy in this world

Dec 29 2022,positive,its hard to find a family movie with this level of substance it is the archetypical heros journey with a twist and something to which parents can relate and kids will love i especially enjoyed the animation techniques in the fight sequences
Dec 29 2022,negative,this movie was not very pleasant the crude humour the corse language and many more inappropriate scenes made the children in the cinema start screaming and crying this ruined the experience that i wanted being a fellow puss in boot fan club member i was offended by the swearing i dont know if the shirtless man dancing in the cinema was apart of the movie but my wife of 64 years and myself loved his performance this movie traumatised all the kids in the cinema when puss died the way he died was very violent because he got shanked up by   wolf the movie tickets were not worth the 365 that i payed for i could of put that money together to by my wife diapers because she is getting old i hope dreamworld fixes this movie and this is a warning for everyone    sincerely   john pentavious mars

Dec 29 2022,positive,i wasnt expecting this movie to be this good i liked the first one ok but i didnt want to go back to see it necessarily and i didnt talk about it much after watching it but this movieblew the first one way out of the water the main song is stuck in my head in a good way the jokes landed constantly the emotions came out of nowhere to pull on your heartstrings then they made you laugh afterwards you felt the intense action that was happening on screen and you liked all the new characters and familiar that they introduced i cant say enough how good this movie is i definitely wouldnt mind seeing this one again and i kind of want someone to ask  lol but yeah definitely a morethansolid entry

Dec 29 2022,positive,best animated movie of the year
Dec 28 2022,positive,this is a fairytale    the narrator states matteroffactly in the beginning of the film and of course youd think a talking cat in boots fighting giant treestone monster while holding a concert is a fairytale right     because if you think so youre wrong puss in boots the last wish is a surprisingly deep and relatable story about the meaning of death and of life     with a mixandmashed version of a few wellknown fairytales the writer showed audiences of all ages some otherwise donetodeath morals that life is to be cherished that the real wish is the friends we made along the way to stop and smell the rose etc etc they are of course not the main parts of the story but they have set a heartwarming ambience to the narrative and did so successfully making it insightful even to an adult    the central piece to the story then is deaths overarching pursuit for puss in boots character animation and sound designers reached for the best of the best in making the appearance of death as horrifying as possible because to puss in boots and possibly most of us he is although he was personified in the film the way different visual elements worked together still made it easy to interpret the story in a figurative way and read its moral that life is to be cherished    the films pace seems somehow rushed but i dont see it being a bad thing fastpaced storytelling does not mean an incoherent narrative and puss in boots the last wish did a nice job in picking up any loose ends before the resolution if anything id prefer its quick pace of narration over a hollywood actionadventurescifiromcom that has a thousand character arcs and spans over three hours    all in all take those morals or not youre still going to enjoy the occasional jokes toptiered graphics design interlinked story arcs and finally that part of your childhood revisited     910

Dec 28 2022,positive,great movie totake my grandchildren to very family friendly  great ending
Dec 28 2022,positive,this movie was amazing and wholesome for all ages especially the animation style to make it look more of a fairytale storybook in 3d this movie brings out little a darker tone that contributes to the moral and drama of this story this movie has taught me how to view death more as mean to live my life in things that matter on family and friends  and i am finally surprised that this movie has brought out a vulnerable side from our feline hero
Dec 28 2022,positive,im not a big fan of animation movies but i thoroughly enjoyed this movie it was very fun to watch tgis movie much recommended to any age groups

Dec 28 2022,positive,went with my children and expected to be entertained but not much more this was more its well voiceacted the story is simple but very effective its visually very appealing it has this mix of 3d and 2d that worked really well but most of all its extremely fun i thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this movie
Dec 28 2022,positive,very entertaining touching with some fantastic looking animation and charming characters the only downside maybe being the moral of the story being obvious from 10 miles away early on but still a nice story i had a blast with this movie and wanna see it again
Dec 28 2022,positive,jo and i are not huge fans of the computer generated cartoons but there are exceptions and this one is an exception the story was good funny took us back to our childhood with all the nursery rhymes we learnt from long ago     the cat was over the top funny and the star and the dog who wanted to be a cat were so precious we both wanted to cuddle himher     a cat has nine lives and puss in boots had used up eight of them he had left his feline cat at the altar and loved being the centre of attraction when he did all his heroic deeds     there were plenty of villains all taken from the nursery rhymes and there was a good v evil plot and in the end only one real nasty  the others changed  i wont give anything else away but do go and enjoy with your children  or like us two old adults relive your childhood again    highly recommended to all
Dec 28 2022,positive,i wasnt sure if puss was good for a fairy tale idea but it worked wonders puss again kills the expectations and antonio banderas again makes me appreciate his hard work at giving a cute cat a badass mannerism collection pib has again made me love the story as puss again made his mark on the movie world see it
Dec 28 2022,positive,puss in boots the last wish is a fun adventure in the shrek universe i gotta admit i have not seen the original film and dont cherish the shrek films as much as many do so i went into this with mild expectations and honestly i had a good time it was cute do i think it was as good as many other reviewers have suggested no but it was enjoyable lighthearted fun that is perfect for families with kids the voice cast was awesome especially john mulaney and florence pugh as the villains jack horner and goldilocks respectively and of course antonio banderas as puss in boots is iconic as ever    the animation here was gorgeous too honestly it was one of my favourite parts i love that major studio animated movies are finally starting to take more risks with their animation style moving away from the typical 3d cgi realism you gotta respect spiderman into the spiderverse for starting this trend and showing that different styles can work i loved that this had a more watercolor storybook illustration look to it it really worked for the story and was employed in such creative ways i would love to see the shrek movies take this on but alas they seem to have established their own look this movie just looked so cool so distinct in its own style it really felt like i was watching a story in a fairy tale world    now of course i have to admit i didnt love this movie something about it felt off to me i couldnt seem to see where the acclaim was coming from sure it was fun it was cute and i enjoyed myself while watching but i never felt like i truly connected with the film the opening scene felt a little jumbled to me rapidly going from a musical sequence to comedy for kids to an action scene and i wished it wouldve let me settle into the story a bit first i get this is a movie primarily for kids but with most animation they tend to make parts enjoyable for the parents and older audiences as well i dont really feel that here  they tried with the themes and the deeper storyline  but it never actually worked in my eyes everything felt very kidfocused which isnt a bad thing it just meant i wasnt the core audience and so it makes sense why i wouldnt enjoy it as much i have to say the kids in my theatre seemed to be having a blast im sure this is a great movie for families with children it just wasnt as good as i was told it would be    i think the movie tried to do a bit of what pixar is known for the whole trying to be deep thing the movie involves puss in boots coming to terms with death and it seemed to be somewhat shallow it never truly dove into this aspect of the story instead the storyline is very linear and somewhat dull where it is just about the characters traveling to their destination and the villains sometimes catching up and then combat ensuing and the physical goal literally being the spiritual goal just makes the inevitable plot point of maybe i dont need the thing i wanted all long and its the friends i made along the way that count seem all the more predictable even puss relationship with the side characters is unchallenging although he is deeply flawed his companions never seem to care about that and forgive him all the time the chemistry of the characters was just nowhere as endearing as in shrek still the adventure was quite fun i just didnt think the themes clicked as it felt like they were trying to be deep in a way that is not as organic and surprising as a film like pixars up finding nemo or even dreamworks how to train your dragon     perhaps i am being too harsh i feel like this review is sounding more negative than anything i really did have fun with it and overall would give it a thumbs up its an enjoyable way to spend an hour and a half the animation was really cool the voice cast was great and man i loved the little nods to the shrek movies even if i was never a huge fan of those if nothing else this movie did make me really hopeful for another shrek film i do enjoy this fairy tale world and the creative animation they used to tell the story
Dec 28 2022,positive,it was funny and enjoyable to watch with family

Dec 28 2022,positive,the best cartoon movie ive seen in years    visuals characters story everything is amazing 
Dec 28 2022,negative,after seeing the overwhelmingly positive response to this movie and all the great critics reviews all i can say is that i must have seen a completely different movie this was not only not amazing it was actually pretty bad im not even mad that it was bad because dreamworks hasnt been making good movies for about a decade now sadly so i wouldnt have bothered to see the movie except for the great reviews and it is exactly as dumb as i originally thought it would be if you think puss in boots 2 is a really great movie trust me the bar is so much higher go watch the dreamworks back catalog pre2011 or pixar pre2010 if you want to watch a great animated movie made more recently check out spiderman into the spiderverse or the lego movie also gdts pinoccio was actually pretty solid i dont want to demean anyones tastes just know that if you love animation and loved this movie there is so much more great things to see so dont set your bar here as for dreamworks i gotta say im so sad to see where youve ended up i really miss the quality of movies you used to make prince of egypt sinbad el dorado spirit kung fu panda 12 how to train your dragon megamind and even shrek i guess these movies will all be remember long after your mediocre cash grabs such as puss in boots 2 are long forgotten

Dec 27 2022,positive,this is one of dreamworks best movies yet its so good from the animation to the pacing to the story itself and the themesmessages woven throughout are not only hardhitting but also genuine and raw the wolf as the villain is wonderful and the side characters are all loveable particularly perrito and goldi and the three bears kitty softpaws and pusss dynamic is hilarious yet beautiful and their arc throughout the movie is incredible im not even going to try to describe how amazed i was at pusss development throughout the film how he goes from an adventuredriven selfobsessed and reckless swashbuckler to a more humble and introspective but still swashbuckling cat having learned from his experiences throughout all of his nine lives and through his encounters with death  literally   i loved this movie so so much and i could probably talk about it all day but i wont keep you go see it

Dec 26 2022,positive,oh my god i did not expect this to be so gosh dang good as it is i only saw one review of this movie beforehand watching it and it said that this movie needs to do well in the box office and i wholeheartedly agree because this sequel to a spinoff is one of the best animated films ive ever seen im not exaggerating there was not a single moment in the movie where i was bored i was constantly engaged every character was amazing i need this film to do well

Dec 26 2022,negative,it was cursing in the movie and i wasnt funny or excitement for my 5 years old daughter very disappointed on her birthday
Dec 26 2022,positive,although some of the characters were endearing it took considerable time to connect with characters and to root for them the actions scenes seems to switch from cg to regular animation the motions look stilted and not as sharp as the other scenes on the positive side the story does finally get going and in the end we were rooting for them good positive themes like family love and living fully foundation laid for a future sequel with puss in boots and someone special good clean fun for children
Dec 26 2022,positive,never a dull moment insane action great comedy one of the greatest animated movies of all time ive seen a lot of animated movies so you can believe me when i say you need to see puss in boots 2
Dec 26 2022,positive,so good it had a little bit of humor for everybody

Dec 26 2022,positive,really really good better than expected the tease at the end also the cherry on top
Dec 26 2022,negative,very dark needed more humour not really sure its aim at kids
Dec 26 2022,positive,i love the character of puss in boots however when he finally got his own solo movie i couldnt help but find it underwhelming it wasnt awful i just didnt have the energy that i wanted turns out the last wish is everything that i wanted from the first puss in boots  the animation is quick yet detailed a lot of the comedy is really dark and really funny the action sequences are incredibly fast and creative and the movie has a lot of great drama and heart  the movie does have flaws though because everything feels so fast the pacing can often times feel really rushed and some of the comedy can come off as a little annoying  but still this movie was better than it had any right to be this is almost everything that i wanted from a puss in boots movie and although its no game changer it is satisfyingly fun
Dec 26 2022,positive,adorable film for kids and adults

Dec 25 2022,positive,much better that expected
Dec 25 2022,positive,a truly heartwarming story that succeeds in creating its own story while still being part of the shrek universe the movie is actually really good at building up tension its characters have clear motivations and are easy to empathize with  and its actually a surprising good movie to watch during christmas i know avatar is a great choice for christmas in 2022 as well but still furthermore beautiful animation style comiclike and a joy for all audience ages it is also oddly therapeutic or should i say oddly therapy dog
Dec 25 2022,positive,there are so many things to love about this movie its visually stunning  with some scenes departing from straight cgi to a sort of drawn animation  comic book shadowing and sensibility in a sort of akira toriyama effect great action scenes over visually rich backdrops and ambience the humor was very well done and i found the jokes quite funny the voice actors were perfect and there were interesting nods to external cultural memes that were a lot of fun such as several obvious references to specific sergio leone western scenes and style flourishes and after all any 2022 film that has a jiminy cricket knockoff character with a jimmy stewart inspired voice has something going on worthwhile
Dec 25 2022,positive,amazing everyone who worked on it is great

Dec 24 2022,positive,a good movie  good story enjoyable adventure  but the animation style feels like they cut corners and had a limited budget not as polished as the shrek movies
Dec 24 2022,negative,first of all there were at least 30 minutes of previews and my 6 yr old granddaughter and 7yr old grandson kept asking when will the movie start the very beginning of the movie was a little entertaining but they both also asked why it was so loud when a scary wolf creature appeared i crossed my fingers that it would hurry up and get past that but it didnt and when the fight between the wolf and puss displayed a drop of blood on the cats face my granddaughter turned to me and said that she did not like the movie and wanted to leaveso we did my grandson mentioned that he also did not like the movie its probably my fault for taking them to a pg rated movie so next time ill know better
Dec 24 2022,positive,it was hilarious incredibly animated and has heart warming themes everyone in the theatre laughed at the funny parts and held each other close at the intense parts the movie was spectacular and brought everything i love about dreamworks studio and overall movies together i would recommend everyone watches it
Dec 24 2022,positive,family of 6 kids ages 715 we all loved it
Dec 24 2022,positive,the fairy tale figures in the story line
Dec 24 2022,positive,i went in with my kids expecting another lackluster puss movie boy was i wrong the animation was clean and fresh with certain sequences standing out due to the frame rate and editing the normally one dimensional puss has some major character development yet does not overshadow the charming supporting cast the voice work was very well done the story had excellent pacing not hampered by nonstop action but enriched with its addition an overall charming movie that will stand the test of time and will set an industry standard for animation
Dec 24 2022,positive,happy that there was a movie out this christmas to take the little ones to
Dec 24 2022,positive,absolutely amazing but a little scary for me as a child

Dec 23 2022,positive,the music story and animation come together to form this masterpiece im not kidding  sure it has some jokes aimed at kids being a kids movie and all but the movie quickly turns around to show you either the most beautiful and dynamic animation youve seen since spiderverse or the most bone chilling and thrilling fight scenes  also the story is so heartwarming and honest with its themes that youll shed a tear at least once  and the music is excellent just like the first movie making use of its spanish influence to bring you some great bops  just watch it its the holidays and youll have a great time

Dec 22 2022,positive,i really think this is the best movie of the shrek franchise  the plot was good it was visually amazing it kept the shrek spirit with a solid humor and the character of the wolf was so well made  well done dreamworks this movie was far beyond my expectations for a movie that is just here to get people into shrek again before the shrek 5 release and i have a very good feeling for this upcomming movie
Dec 22 2022,positive,it has the adventurous energy from the puss in boots prequel but with the comedic tone from shrek 2 the visuals are gorgeous with some very surprising new characters thrown into the mix overall storyline was a great addition to the shrek franchise and is a fun time for the family or just adults

Dec 22 2022,positive,this is so good its funny sharp kind of edgy has great action sequences and a heartwarming story the movie is quickly paced nothing drags or seems unnecessary and the characters are great the wolf was a pleasant surprise and my kids were engrossed the entire time absolutely loved it
Dec 22 2022,positive,saw it twice already the kids love it
Dec 22 2022,positive,good fun but very strange some scenes were too scary for my children  and maybe me too haha puss between shrek and his prior movie seems to push the reset button on his character growth each time as a slightly different version of himself that almost feels like a multiverse some moments though cartoonish felt eerily violent for kids some character designs were uncomfortably bizarre the reason i still give it top marks is that it took me on a roller coaster of entertainment so i can really complain
Dec 22 2022,positive,family movie that i recommend
Dec 22 2022,positive,this movie was awesome the animation was great the characters were awesome and i absolutely love it
Dec 22 2022,positive,boys and i loved it cant go wrong here with the little ones

Dec 22 2022,positive,it was cute my daughter loved it
Dec 22 2022,positive,it features a lot of style and emotion to keep it engaging throughout the cast and visuals are top tier but this unexpected characterdriven story will bring shrek fans joy

Dec 22 2022,positive,this was one for the books this film was very family oriented and it stuck with the books and storytelling  you can go sooo  friends and even family its all flit enjoy  better than the original
Dec 22 2022,positive,great animation action and humor  surprisingly heartfelt story lines  young children may be frightened by the wolf portraying death and may be too young to appreciate the story line   leave the kids home and go see it yourself
Dec 22 2022,positive,this is absolutely one of the best movies in the franchise the animation was beautiful and the fights were amazing the villain gave me chills the movie gives you a great sense of how scared puss was and you really need to see the ending got me very hyped for whats in store 
Dec 22 2022,positive,my family really enjoyed the movie
Dec 22 2022,positive,a great peformance from the entire cast a beautiful score that highlights hispaniclatinamerican culture in a way that isnt forceful a wellanimated and lively environment and fantastic writing if youre looking to bring your elementary schooler to this movie id say its a little intense if youre a vet and have ptsd you probably shouldnt see this movie either a certain character might trigger some things this serves as a beautiful teaser for shrek 5 and does lots of character development for puss and his innercircle highly suggest  one of the best movies ive seen all year to be honest
Dec 22 2022,positive,the wolf is such a powerful character the movie really pushes the medium of animation past just a kids movie generator well done dw
Dec 22 2022,positive,for a kids movie it wasnt bad  it doesnt teach any life lessons its just entertainment
Dec 22 2022,positive,this movie is amazing i had low to mid expectations for this movie and it absolutely surpassed it the animation was great the story was simple and predictable but very well executed but what i love is the villain the villain really gave me the creeps everytime he appears the voice acting was perfect its just amazing

Dec 22 2022,positive,this movie was great the animation was buitiful and reminded me of spiderman into the spiderverses art style and the way it did the story was like bullet train even though they were in production at the same time great over all
Dec 22 2022,positive,it was very funny  and great zingers  it had suspense and adventure too
Dec 22 2022,positive,its so bright and zany the animation was spiderverse levels of good i love found family the therpay dog was actually good and not just annoying goldilocks  there were too many storylines so it was just right second best movie of the year just behind everything everywhere all at once
Dec 22 2022,positive,a must see  shrek nostalgia but more than that the storyline is touching
Dec 22 2022,positive,very good movie would recommend
Dec 22 2022,positive,funny family movie with great messages throughout
Dec 22 2022,positive,such a fun movie  the story was really well done and the action sequences were done in a different animation style that gave it really good flavor
Dec 22 2022,positive,i thought it was cute and the animation was great great movie for kids as well as adults
Dec 22 2022,positive,best in the franchise since shrek 2 by a wide margin the comedy is the sharpest ive seen from dreamworks in years and it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that they still have as much fresh edge as they did from day 1 the animation is obviously inspired by spiderverse and it gives the film a sense of kinetic energy and striking spectacle that i was really hoping to see more of from the studio after the brilliant presentation of bad guys the emotional beats accomplish their goals pretty well especially when it comes to a certain family but a little more depth to the main antagonist would have been appreciated to make the final confrontation feel a touch more meaningful overall a fantastic movie that squashes all worries i had for the next steps that dreamworks are shaping up to take in the shrek franchise
Dec 22 2022,positive,good music well done
Dec 22 2022,positive,good enough for adults to sit through and get laughs
Dec 22 2022,positive,sad happy scary 200000010 would watch again loved it
Dec 22 2022,positive,enjoyed this with the family  its a really sweet flick
Dec 22 2022,positive,the movie was absolutely incredible art style was refreshing pacing was on point not a super long movie felt engaged the entire time every progression within the story made sense super duper funny jokes and the side dog was not annoying at all loved the backstory between kitty soft paws and puss the absolute best part of the movie was the death wolf as the horror aspect that he brought was insanely good please go watch this movie
Dec 22 2022,positive,yes some of the action may be a little intense for some kids depending on what theyre used to but i really enjoyed the show the animation was unique and different and the meaning behind the parable was rock solid
Dec 22 2022,positive,was a very good show for all ages
Dec 22 2022,positive,it was an absolutely must see movie of 2022 loved the movie
Dec 22 2022,positive,great family movie over the holidays
Dec 21 2022,negative,the animation was choppy and not as clean as shrek movies as if they just threw it together and rushed it for release

Dec 21 2022,positive,a surprisingly mature and enjoyable film in a medium that has seen widespread mediocrity as of late 𝘗𝘶𝘴𝘴 𝘪𝘯 𝘉𝘰𝘰𝘵𝘴 𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘓𝘢𝘴𝘵 𝘞𝘪𝘴𝘩 sticks out like a pie dipped thumb
Dec 21 2022,positive,the animation is spectacular and the action was topnotch    and it has a meaningful story of cherishing the one life that you have this has to be one of my favorite animated movies of the year
Dec 21 2022,negative,the animation for this story as simplistic as it was doesnt work for me it was nice to see puss in boots again but the animation and story didnt do much for me the humor worked at times but overall nothing memorable for me
Dec 21 2022,negative,movie is too long scary for small children
Dec 21 2022,positive,i really enjoyed this follow up to puss in boots  voices of the cast were great  my favorites were of course puss kitty softpaw and perrito  themes of love family and belonging were weaved into the story  there were some humor as well  perritos character steals the show though hes an animated character hes lovable
Dec 21 2022,positive,it was a bit on the dark side not really the happy movie i expected but it was worth the watch for a older group may be a bit scary for really small children alot of death talked about  alot of witchcraft
Dec 21 2022,positive,this film mixes great comedy great action really unique visualls and a really good story
Dec 21 2022,negative,just plain awful my family and i loved ice age shrek etc  this movie is not worth your money or donation of the time of your life to watch it
Dec 21 2022,positive,i still cant believe this is a pg film even though it has cusses and it doesnt make it better that is beeped but good movie
Dec 21 2022,positive,i took my 9yearold granddaughter to see the movies first showing at a local theater  not normally impressed with kid movies but this was actually pretty good  my granddaughter was even telling me about the things that the movie was trying to get across to the viewers  by far the best of the five movies we saw together in 2022
Dec 21 2022,positive,superb this is the kind of thing animation was meant for

Dec 21 2022,positive,the film is a masterpiece to the animation to the writing humor for all ages it doesnt pander to children when people say this is the logan in the shrek series they arent lying a story about death love and team friendship
Dec 21 2022,positive,purfect movie and lots of laughs
Dec 21 2022,positive,cute flick  highly recommend to see
Dec 21 2022,positive,loved it leaves you smiling 
Dec 21 2022,positive,what an adventure new fun characters wonderful animation and a unique story make this film worthy of the titular legend feline     i really appreciate the characters especially two outstanding villain characters arguably some of the best to come from the studio ever no spoilers there was no character i didnt like which is a rarity it was also very funny at times i even had to hold back laughter in the theater     the art style especially the backgrounds reminds me of the original way the settings were done by hand painting on animated films such as disneys bambi 1942 this film brings back such artistic styles which founded animation styles that have been replaced and critically forgotten over the last few decades it is a similar animation style to that in spiderman into the spiderverse 2018 yet it was more paintinglike and less comic booklike it truly did make me feel as if i was inside a fairytale world    addressing some fellow audience critiques one villain in particular definitely sent chills down my spine when he appeared enough so that any child might want to advert eyes for a second or two this is a true villain character it is important to recognize that even if a villain may be scary that is the point as far as that kind of villain being in a movie with children in mind if you think about it over the years films have lacked such despicable characters especially looking back at some earlier animation films from big studios including disney therefore this really shouldnt be a factor in limiting any child to see this film under your advisement it is pg for this reason     after seeing this unexpectedly great film i wouldnt be opposed to a sequel or other future films especially with the same style as in this film perhaps even this is further motivation to prepare for the 5th installment in a particular franchise in the same universe
Dec 21 2022,positive,loved puss with an attitude  give it a shot
Dec 21 2022,positive,im a lover of cats and this was too cute

Dec 20 2022,positive,from the unique visually captivating animation to the stylistic takes on classic storybook characters this film provides a pleasurable and engaging journey for the senses it features a narrative that tackles darker themes such as anxiety and death in a fresh digestible manner whilst delivering a simpleyet importantmessage that anyone can relate to overall its a good time and a worthwhile watch for any animation fan

Dec 20 2022,positive,fun family flick  it wont disappoint
Dec 20 2022,positive,puss is too cute  kids loved it
Dec 19 2022,positive,cute flick  kids can get enough of this character
Dec 19 2022,positive,you guys have to go watch it
Dec 19 2022,positive,fantastic film that really took me off guard did not expect to see the level of depth and character building that was put on show this movie proves that puss can be more than just a basic ladies man and adrenaline junky highly recommend
Dec 19 2022,positive,of course it is need to watch cartoon again but for the first time the film is fun and tears  an absolutely beautifully told story the heroes of which you sympathize with and experience their grief and happiness with them   the film touches on very deep topics which it is not afraid to reflect on and bring these thoughts to the end   the visual is incredible made in the spirit of our time which does not prevent cartoon from combining elements into an exciting picture level    if to mention a few words about the shrek franchise then this film has an indirect relation to it which is pleasantly surprising and gives additional disclosure to the characters  the cartoon is independent and it would be good to see more such cartoons in the future it is for them to give money in cinemas
Dec 19 2022,positive,fun funny and profound  a lot of good life messages thrown in
Dec 18 2022,positive,this movie is amazing from the plot to the animation not only do they make multiple refrences to the previous movie and several fairy tales but they also give old characters who could arguably be considered plain and unevolved across the movie more personality as they play into their fears and make them see life or death in some cases as it really is overall this movie is a masterpiece and i hope you will enjoy it if you do decide to watch it
Dec 18 2022,positive,amazing animation great action scenes round and interesting characters with believable arcs and a true villain to be scared of the best animation to come out at 2022 and its not the one james cameron made

Dec 15 2022,positive,one of the best animated movies ive seen in recent years pacing is excellent and the characters are lovely and memorable i watched in 2d and the animation is already an absolute treat would probably look even better in 3d tugs at the heartstrings and gives amazing character development to every character that needed it excellent movie would watch it again

Nov 27 2022,positive,puss in boots the last wish is not only the best animated movie of this year but one of my favorite movies this year for starters the animation style is fucking fantastic its a mix of 3d and 2d animation that just looks amazing the action and movement of the camera is also just outstanding i was in awe of how good this movie looked obviously puss in boots was a great character but even the supporting characters are a blast to watch probably the biggest surprise tho was the story and how mature it was for a kids movie its themes and emotions were just so damn good given how puss in boots is on his last life overall this movie was everything id hoped and more

Nov 27 2022,positive,loved the story and the villains
Nov 27 2022,positive,phenomenally shot visually stunning and cleverly written one of the best animated films to release in the last few years go see this when it comes out
Nov 27 2022,positive,phenomenally made gorgeous animation and breathtaking story see this when it releases
Nov 27 2022,positive,incredible film even better than the first puss movie i cannot wait to go see it again perrito and the wolf were amazing i need more of them
Nov 27 2022,positive,an emotionally driven story that kept both children and parents entertained a stand alone spinoff that still kept the humor of the original story the animation was mostly amazing but sometimes shifted into the realm of a choppy anime style film we did like and dislike the masking of adult language at least the kids did we would watch again
Nov 27 2022,positive,got to see a special early advance screening of pussinboots the last wish and it was  excellent more voice acting gold from antonio banderas stunning visuals took me a second to get used to it but really dig this style and a story that wellexplores surprisingly mature themes via a wildly enjoyable fairy talefueled adventure bonus  for perrito  ethical bug    review part 2  puss in boots the last wish was a much better movie than what i thought it was going to be the movie really does start to step back into the shrek roots and the animation is solid and a bit diverse with acting and direction to pull the feelings into the occurring character development puss in boots the last wish is a solid return to the world that began in shrek and features great voiceacting that delivers solid comedy at times and makes for one wild ride
Nov 27 2022,positive,this was better than the first puss in boots by miles the animation and voice acting were amazing every new character from perito to the bears stood out some of the imagery was beautiful very funny a message you dont see executed well in family media is very well done here one of dreamworks best the hot streak continues 1010
Nov 27 2022,positive,i loved the plot and the characters the emotional depth of the story was well portrayed and i liked the discovery all the characters experienced towards the climax of the film i thought the scary parts were too scary for the age group that was in the theater certainly for my kids but there wasnt too many scary parts two characters deserve some criticism i didnt care for big jack at all his physical size was off and didnt quite fit in with the rest of the movie and the wolf whom i loved i thought his character was for a much older audience as even the subject of death was a bit much for my kids
Nov 27 2022,positive,this is such a cute and fun movie for the whole family a beautifully done edition to the shrek universe  unique animation style and new fary tale story
Nov 27 2022,positive,this was a pleasure to see as someone who commonly finds animated childrenfriendly movies lacking i was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing at wellexecuted punchlines and invested in the characters where the first movie a decade ago lagged this one zoomed also the music was great and i was disappointed that i couldnt find the intro theme anywhere online after seeing the film this afternoon see it if youre debating
Nov 27 2022,positive,the movie was great held my kids attention from beginning to end there were parts where my 6 year old got a little scared but nothing inappropriate for a 6 year old i would recommend this movie for the whole family
Nov 27 2022,positive,easily better than the 1st and the animation is godtier perfection perrito is a scene stealing comedic genius and goldi  the 3 bears deserve their own spinoff while they most of the jokes play it safely dreamworks animation has entered its renaissance era
Nov 27 2022,positive,the movie is the best of all especially when perrito swears and beeps which is very similar to merton from dc league of superpets
Nov 27 2022,positive,it was a great movie i thought it was better than the first movie i was a little hesitant on the change of animation but it actually wasnt to bad i really enjoyed it and so did my kids
Nov 27 2022,positive,the movie was a bit choppy and fastpaced at first but once the villains are introduced and the plot is set in motion it gets really entertaining the animation was phenomenal and the voice acting and sound were superb the music both vocal and instrumental worked really well with the movie i really enjoyed puss in boots the last wish it was well worth the wait to return to the shrek universe
Nov 27 2022,positive,just saw the opening day theater prescreening phenomenal meowywowey work of art this sequel is surprisingly better than the first from a decade ago i absolutely like this movie especially the hero characters so much that i wish they were real so i could meet and talk with them being a cat photographer at local animal shelters i particularly appreciated the scenes of mucho cats at the crazy cat ladys rescue home where poor puss ended up in and a subtle revelation by kitty soft paws on the sadness of having declawed paws i want to see this movie again and againand again
Nov 27 2022,positive,entertaining for both kids and adults action packed and hilarious a must see
Nov 27 2022,positive,an absolute family masterpiece my family and i loved this movie the animation was amazing the jokes were hilarious and the fight scenes were beautiful this movie was amazing and i would strongly recommend bringing your family to see puss in boots the last wish

Nov 27 2022,positive,loved it gives you a great time at  the theaters
Nov 27 2022,positive,fantastic animation style with stunning action sequences and beautifully colored moments emotion was well done on all fronts and while the story may have been somewhat predictable for the older audience this would be a fantastic watch for the younger kids nonetheless the story is enjoyable for everyone also the wolf was animated extremely well and its fearful aura was some of the best ive seen in an animated format
Nov 27 2022,positive,puss in boots the last wish achieved what very few animated sequels to a spinoff have done accelerate forward in every way shape in form i love the combo of 2d and 3d animation here the new characters are memorable the action reminded me a lot of into the spiderverse and the overall moral is actually pretty effective only negative it can get a bit cliche in a few places    definitely recommend this when it officially releases in a few weeks     8510 stars
Nov 26 2022,positive,with its darker tone and some adult words and humor it may be a bit much for a younger audience though its a bit more mature it is still heart warming and really hilarious i found myself laughing out more then i care to admit my 7 year old absolutely loved it all in all good movie for the family
Nov 26 2022,positive,great voice cast and interesting storyline works on many levels two adults attended and both really enjoyed

Nov 26 2022,positive,made it to the sneak preview and puss and boots and the last wish is a pleasant surprise of a sequel thats equally entertaining for children and adults the premise and storyline is very deep for a family animated movie which will keep the parents consistently engaged coming to grips with evolving over time as an individual along with those you share your life with that value you and appreciating them as family andor friends is a very profound lesson that can resonate with kids and adults whether in first view or many times afterwards with this well made movie just as good if not better than the original 
Nov 26 2022,positive,puss is back in action the cast was outstanding the visuals were beautiful the music went hard and the animation though had that gloss of into the spiderverse animation which i love so much 1010 one of the best animated films of the year
Nov 26 2022,positive,we liked when death showed us his pearly whites we like when puss n boots and death walked through the fire
Nov 26 2022,positive,this story of puss in boots was great lots of laughs for the kids and adults in true shrek fashion great new characters and some backstory on some that we already know some parts seem a little slow at times but overall a great movie to take the family to see
Nov 26 2022,positive,it was really great except there was a lot of kids
