Feb 27 2024,positive, the biggest cinematic undertaking of the last 15plus years kevin feiges grand attempt to serialize blockbuster storytelling has featured some ridiculous highs and some bleak lows its changed the way hollywood looks at its intellectual properties and its trying to figure out its uncertain future after briefly imploding under the weight of its massive overreach into film and streaming television weve gone through all 33 of the mcus films from 2008s iron man to last falls the marvels and ranked them according to quality we dont include the streaming series in this list either just the movies while youll notice a high number of recent mcu films toward the bottom of the list keep in mind that the series struggles postavengers endgame have been substantial largely because of storytelling issues as much as those films showed real promise they represented a marvel studios that lost its consistency hence the recent efforts to retool the universe before we get to the sole mcu film of 2024 in deadpool  wolverine lets dive into how the 33 films that came before it stacked up against each other this is truly the low point in the mcu a film that purely exists to connect dozens of uncompelling dots to a future that probably now wont happen because of jonathan majors being booted from his role as kang for his legal issues the film tries to find its own path into the james gunniness of the galaxy of the guardians movies but it fails miserably in that pursuit we love paul rudd but not even he could save this one from itself its everything wrong with the mcu at its worst corporate product that exists to expand the empire rather than tell a compelling story with relatable characters chloé zhao is an incredibly talented filmmaker who is responsible for some of the best films of the last decade eternals is sadly not one of them pairing zhao with the mcu just simply didnt work for either party producing a largely lifeless superhero slog that very much overstays its welcome zhaos natural lighting works incredibly for her arthouse films but its not a match for studio filmmaking its just a huge miss by a major talent which happens taika waititis longanticipated to the incredibly fun thor ragnarok was an absolute stinker for most of its runtime one that lost its grip the tonal excellence of its predecessor and wastes a very fun christian bale villainous turn its not the worst of the bunch necessarily but its perhaps the biggest disappointment on the list nia dacosta is another incredibly talented filmmaker whose marvel project went off the rails because of the mcu nightmare machines malfunctioning the films story is nearly incoherent and it leaves a few inspires set pieces to dry with nonsensical villainy and far too much reliance on having seen multiple television shows to understand whats going on in totality we dont blame dacosta for this the signs of life feel directly linked to her creativity destin daniel crettons short term 12 is one of the best movies of the 2010s so it hurts our hearts to rank his mcu movie so low on this list its an occasional chore one that cannot link its kungfu homages to the cg messiness that envelops the film by its third act tony leung is as good as advertised but the rest of this movie struggles to live up to that performance the first sign of trouble in the postavengers endgame mcu black widow just felt too little too late an attempt to make up for the unfairly procrastinated black widow origin movie that cant match its compelling human moments with its bland action set pieces we liked the cast but it didnt live up to the potential of telling natasha romanoffs backstory the clever bits cant quite save this one from forgettable territory even if its a step ahead than the rest of the movies on this list antmans first film is the best of the bunch while this one just felt too small and unimportant in the grand scheme of things to really register rather than use that smallness to its advantage it just felt a bit superfluous its not bad though brie larson is a terrific actor but the origin story for her captain marvel doesnt quite live up to what it couldve been it is a fun 90s adventure film and it was about time for the mcu to give a woman her own film in the series we just wish it was yknow more deserving of the moment even if the moment in and of itself boosts this one up a bit this one gets a bad rap its by no means a great movie or anything but its got a very good tom hiddleston performance and moves at a satisfying clip the elven villains are notoriously bad but the rest of the film is alright while it pales in comparison to ang lees thrilling 2003 hulk edward nortons lone venture into the mcu as the angry green guy was a perfectly suitable introduction for the character its hard that its been so long since this one came out but its better than you remember definitely the weakest avengers film this overstuffed sequel still found a way to take the series into a refreshingly dark direction while giving jeremy renners hawkeye a nice spotlight to work with still this one hasnt aged nearly as well as it played in the moment the weakest of the jon watttom holland spiderman films this one is like a tasty burrito that is so overstuffed that it falls out the bottom and gets all over your lap when you try to eat it the films second act is as good as advertised but you have to wade through a very uneven first half to get there its darn good when it wants to be but it needs a much tighter edit coasting on the nostalgia of yesterday can only get you so far when the jokes arent landing and the plot gets a little too convoluted thank goodness this one found its footing in the second act and eventually lived up to the potential it was always going to be hard to live up to iron man but iron man 2 is probably the mcu film that deserves more credit than it gets its a very enjoyable sequel that deepens the journey for robert downey jrs tony stark while zeroing in on some really wellcrafted fight scenes its a good film flawed sure but weve missed this kind of effectively contained storytelling in these movies the remnants of edgar wrights scrapped vision for this film and rudds impossibly buoyant charm helped the first antman movie stand out while its still a step behind some of the better origin films its the best scott lang movie of the three its funny its got a good heist and again there are a few scenes in this that feel preserved from wrights ideas well take it kenneth branaghs take on the norse god definitely just scratched the potential that waititi found with thor ragnarok but its still a very enjoyable origin tale that took full advantage of branaghs shakespeare background in building the asgardian palace intrigue it also is the film that first understood how funny chris hemsworth could be with good material jake gyllenhaals mysterio and some really clever visual effect sequences give the second spiderman a real jolt as the lighter elements of hollands take on the character meshed well with the way this one raised the stakes its a good spiderman flick even if the tony stark tech of it all got a little tiring the first half of the conclusion to the infinity saga left viewers in limbo with a gut punch of an ending even if it wasnt hard to see how it would all get undone in the next movie it felt like half a journey and what you do to get there isnt necessarily as compelling as what came after it however its hard to knock the mcu with finding this dour a story and sticking to it to the closing credits for a year marvel wasnt afraid to avoid a happy ending that was nice they should do it again some time a clever political thriller disguised as a captain america movie this one really showed audiences that the mcu could branch itself into some really interesting directions that would pay off in the future it felt a bit riskier than some of its predecessors and it complicated the universe in some welcomed ways its not quite the achievement its made out it be but its quite good a spectacular opening to lament the loss of chadwick boseman ryan cooglers directorial savvy and a very complicated villain in namor helped lift the second black panther film through the tragedy of bosemans loss that alone is cause for respect even if this one falls into the cg fight mess of most of the mcu films its still one of the better titles on this list doctor strange got one of the best origin films in this series one that utilized filmmaker scott derricksons genre bona fides with some mindbending visuals to couple with benedict cumberbatchs memorable take on the sorcerer supreme also adding benedict wong to these movies was such a smart move he never wastes a second of his screen time the first holland spidey film is also the best one that felt refreshingly removed from the mcu ongoings and scaled down peter parkers universe into a new york cityset drama with real stakes and effective comingofage comedy michael keatons vulture is one of the mcus best and believable villains while the mcu never fully capitalized on the fascinating rift between captain america and iron man this film deserved a lot of credit for creating that fraction in the first place the airport battle is still one of the best scenes in all of these movies and the introduction to hollands spiderman is still such a joy and the best use of his iteration of the character in this series the first captain america film is still the best as joe johnstons world war ii actionadventure did an incredibly effective job of introducing steve rogers and underscoring the scrappy virtues that defined the character chris evans earned his star power in this role and he was never better than here getting shane black to make an iron man movie just felt too good to be true as this fantastically entertaining third tony stark solo venture took the markings of a great shane black movie and put them in the mcu to great effect its a very subversive introspective film one replete with great action sequences and a bad guy switcheroo for the ages its the most underappreciated film in this series by far the best film postavengers endgame by a country mile sam raimis thrilling unpredictable doctor strange sequel took some bold steps to complicate the mcu while playing into those raimi staples that make him one of the best filmmakers to ever work in the genre elizabeth olsens fascinating heel turn for wanda maximoff is still one of the bravest decisions in any of these movies and raimi knew exactly how to capitalize on it it was so gratifying to have raimi back in the genre and this was a clear highlight for the mcu to learn from and build off of in the future perhaps the most purely fun mcu film to date waititi revived the thor movies in stellar fashion with this incredibly funny consistently impressive action comedy that boasted freakin cate blanchett as its bad guy there are so many inspired bits in this movie capped with a technicolor smackdown finale that rivals any other in the mcu this movie is just a blast even the most cynical person had to give the mcu its flowers for nailing this grand finale to a decadeplus of storytelling as the infinity saga came to its grand conclusion its a gripping spectacle that closes out so many storylines with a satisfying cap and gave downey jr and evans some rich material for their final outings as iron man and captain america the series may never reach this fever pitch again but were glad we got to watch the plan come together in such a memorable way gunn is the best filmmaker to ever work in the mcu and his guardians of the galaxy films are the gold standard for this series as a whole the second installment richened the characters while also giving michael rookers yondu one of its best character arcs kurt russell was such an inspired bit of casting as ego and the film just packs such a wallop with its deeply emotional finale we dare you not to cry at what happens during the cat stevens needle drop gunns final outing in the mcu with his guardians was also one of the best mcu films period exploring rocket raccoons heartbreaking backstory and welding that with its main story arc just hit like a ton of bricks as gunn refused to let this one pass him by without a statement the films final dance scene to florence  the machine is just such a joyous summation of why these movies worked so well and why theyll be so missed in gunns hands probably one of the most exciting blockbusters of the 2010s the first avengers film was a genuine moment in pop culture one that pulled off a teamup movie that had never been attempted before in film history it set the standard incredibly high for how these multihero movies would go and were not sure any of the films to come after it ever cleared the bar cooglers masterful first black panther film is also one of the best blockbusters of the 2010s one that created an indelible moment in pop culture that widened spectacle representation in a way that felt sustainable this one is just everything good about superhero films from the stellar craftwork to cooglers sharp eye for staging the material and michael b jordans unforgettable villainous turn that refused easy explanations of course bosemans memory lingers high on this one in the rearview as it was his true moment to shine in the role that defined him as hard as it is to believe downey jr was not one of hollywoods biggest stars before his first iron man movie came out this film not only led to perhaps the greatest comeback in acting history but also launched the mcu in spectacular fashion its perhaps the most grounded marvel film to date but its also one of the absolute best for a reason everything is owed to iron man a film that launched a moment and set a standard that hasnt always been reached the pinnacle of the mcu was also its greatest risk as it took a genre filmmaker who had never worked with this big a canvas before in gunn and some of marvels most obscure characters and made a masterpiece out if it guardians of the galaxy essentially changed the way that superhero movies could be made adding in a cosmic sense of irreverence and a template for building lovable characters out of oblong sketches it launched chris pratt to stardom and turned rocket racoon and groot into household names it also showed how putting in the right amount of heart and pathos can essentially make even the strangest of characters the most cheerworthy of heroes were not sure the mcu will ever top the first guardians film as its the shining standard for what marvel movies can be take risks hire good filmmakers who fit the mold and let them cook cast wisely let these things breathe without so much responsibility to the grander universes if we can get at least one more movie from marvel as great as this its a huge win
Aug 19 2022,positive, while an understandable superhero movie fatigue has sat in for many longtime invested fans look forward to each new installment to the marvel in dc cinematic universes for me personally the captain america films have been particularly exciting part of it is due to my love for the cap character dating back to my childhood but it is also because the previous two films have been among marvels best especially 2014s the winter soldier the third cap movie holds an unusual position in marvels grand picture it doesnt actually feel like a captain america film it feels much bigger and broader  an avengerslike installment if you will anthony and joe russo return to direct a screenplay by stephen mcfeely and christopher markus the filmmakers have certainly made a movie which seeks to expand the mcus narrative rather than telling a tighter more focused captain america story the story is inspired by a fantastic marvel comics crossover event that ran from 2006 through 2007 the story had a ripple effect that reached to several individual hero comics most notably captain americas here as expected there are few similarities to the comic arc other than a rift between the avengers the massive destruction and casualties following the avengers previous battles have driven governments worldwide to adopt the sokovia accords which places the avengers under united nations control tony stark robert downey jr signs off on the resolution seeing the avengers as no better than criminals if they are unwilling to play by rules steve rogers chris evans stands firm in his trust of the teams judgment and his distrust of the politics behind governments the rift between heroes presents itself early on but the film takes its time in developing it along the way the it ties up several loose ends from the previous two cap movies as well as put heavy emphasis on his continued search for bucky aka the winter soldier sebastian stan civil war features so many moving parts and most of them function well the established characters still have the same charm and charisma and i still enjoy spending time with them thats one reason it is easy to be effected once the tension springs up marvel studios has done a great job introducing their characters and developing the relationships between them a couple of noticables are missing here but some new players are added into the fold chadwick boseman is fantastic as black panther and tom holland takes on the role of spiderman storywise things are the best when the focus is on the but it flounders a bit in telling the story of a mysterious sokovian militant played by daniel brühl his story is a bit scattered and never has a satisfying end another strength of the film is its pulsepounding action part of what made the winter soldier great was that it used a lot of traditional effects and stunt work its the same here intensely choreographed action sequences come in spurts and each are incredibly impressive of course we get some cgi but the handtohand combat and wild chase sequences are mainly done via oldschool means and several of the scenes are still carved in my memory the film also steers clear of the big mindnumbing cgi laden finale no crumbling skyscrapers or citywide devastation its still a violent ending but much more personal and consequential the movie should also be commended for genuinely trying to ask some significant questions and deal with some weighty issues and it doesnt just toss them out there and them leave them behind these dilemmas run throughout the film characters wrestle with death and loss others struggle with responsibility and consequences and while the film may not be an appeal to deep thinkers among its large amounts of fan service it does explore areas that few from the genre care to captain america civil war feels like it could be titled avengers civil war in fact it actually serves as a better avengers sequel than last years age of ultron but we do still get plenty of captain america and his character is still the most intriguing piece in this entire puzzle but as a whole the movie does more to alter the landscape of the marvel cinematic universe as we know it by the end things are much different characters have been impacted relationships have been affected most importantly it sets before us a very interesting landscape and the potential for some incredibly intriguing storylines i cant wait to see where things go next great review i loves this movie so much but i did think it felt more like a cap film then an avengers one infinity wars or whatever theyre going to call it now will be interesting interesting it felt more like an avengers movie to me but with cap as the main character especially when you compare it to the other two movies still loved it though this was a phenomenal film  everything feltbalanced  thats a hard thing to do in a movie of this scale when you have so many important characters and plot points to cover  i think robert downey jr gives his best performance as tony stark in civil war  everybody else is just as good though  the film also blazes through the story  for a 25 hour film it didnt feel like it  it doesnt slow down when introducing new characters like black panther who absolutely fantastic  for me personally i think that civil war is the best mcu movie to date  considering that winter soldier was a truly exceptional film thats quite an achievement in my eyes  this is the movie that age of ultron should have been i completely agree age of ultron hasnt left that much of an impression with me this one is much better well made and a lot of fun too  great read keith man this thing has really struck a chord with everyone myself included a skeptic when it comes to captain america films one of the main praises its receiving is its ability to balance all the characters and give them each a chance to shine without really outshining anyone else i suppose you can always make the argument tonys signature wit still is the most prominent characteristic of any of them but still even he dialed back the snark here things are serious man i really enjoyed it and gave it a much higher score than i ever thought i would its really good right i think winter soldier may still be my favorite marvel picture but this is close it is really well written and well made with only a couple of things that i didnt feel worked but still as you touch on juggling that many characters and that big of a story arc is pretty tough miraculously they pull it off nice review i wasnt as big a fan as everyone thought it took a while to get going and i didnt feel the initial action scenes but in the end i did think it was entertaining and i would like to see the airport fight scene again thanks i really went for the action scenes i really like the way they film handtohand combat and chase sequences it really fits characters like cap bucky panther widow etc but i also appreciate how well they do when its time to go big the more fantastic superpowers are also very well represented pretty much liked them all ive always loved the mcu despite some of its mediocre entries thor 12 the incredible hulk but this one just might be my favorite deeply rooted in emotion breathtaking action and a plot that emphasized the consequences of what it means to be a superhero i can see this becoming one of the quintessential movies in the genre a few years down the line great review thanks man i loved how this one asked some deeper questions but doesnt just leave them for all of the normal cliches it makes the emotional themes a pivotal part i the story loved that another great review your points match my own in particular the villains story i felt that if you removed his events the film moves along just fine i much prefer this to age of ultron yes im glad to hear someone else agree with that point the villain of the film was such a far cry from the actual comic book version which is okay but he was so generic and his payoff wasnt that impressive is that how you saw it too late indeed and to be honest i thought that scene showed such an overused motive just didnt work for me but he is a smaller part to an otherwise great experience im glad this film is getting an excellent response as i had fun watching it as well as the fact that it was willing to ask some big questions which is what blockbuster films should be true and not only ask the questions but be willing a to stick with them and explore them really caught me off guard in a good way glad to see you had such a good time with this one while i liked it i definitely didnt love it like the previous two films too little captain america for my liking you agree too it didnt feel like a cap movie right sure he was a main character but it didnt have the intimacy of the other two i thought youd enjoy this partly as a comic book fan but also because you enjoyed the winter soldier so much this is a different kind of beast from the earlier russo brothers film in many respects but it sits alongside it comfortably and its one of the most fun times ive had at the cinema with a marvel film liked the action scenes a lot liked the new introductions and there was a good blend with the returning ones too im in a weird state where im trying to balance the old superhero fatigue with a desire to see standalone films for black widow black panther spiderman and antman sooner rather than later i think id really dig a bourne or bondstyle black widow film marvel has done a really good job overall i can see it being so easy to grow tired of these films but they give us such fleshed out and compelling characters each with their own uniquenesses and identities and then they give them good stories to tell i also think their casting has been fantastic for the most part yeah i agree i think one or two of the villains havent been particularly memorable but i think thats down to the writing rather than the casting or anything the actors in question are doing wrong only hiddlestons loki has really stood out for me though if you take the winter soldier as a villainantagonist as he was in the last film then i guess stan was pretty cool too and i remember one great review of thor the dark world where the reviewer asked the question why would you take the most compelling villain marvel have had to date and leave him locked up in a cell for an hour and a half but im digressing now i agree not the best track record with their villains overall i to think winter soldier was great even with his complexities hopefully they can make thanos legitimately good as well i too may the point that this could easily be called avengers civil war but if you did that the absence of thor and hulk would be felt more and more people would be in more uproar  but i very much liked this film its success in handling 12 characters all at one is outstanding but also the result of the universe taking its time over the years and actually giving their characters proper exposure instead of being thrown into one big heap a la bvs probably not as good as winter soldier liked that action a bit more but still a great time and unlike aou you actually feel legit change great post i so agree with you on several things most notably winter soldier aou and how the universe has successfully built up these characters over time it definitely has put the avengers in an interesting place odd though i knew all the others but i didnt find myself invested in the battle i also thought they kinda went overboard with the collateral damage part they took about an hour just to introduce that theme i do agree with you though that it is nice to see a film of this genre actually tackling such a theme and doing quite well with it even if i thought it was a tad overdone for me i enjoyed bruhl as the villain i thought he was great i do agree though that his story was a bit scattered definitely his acting though was great i thought and im with you that it could have been an avengers movie i think the best thing about this flick is how well they managed such a huuuuge amount of characters thanks for the thoughts it is always interesting when people have different reactions i do see where you are coming from i just had a much different experience i thought this one had a lot more heart and much higher stakes particularly on personal levels  bruhls performance was fine really good actor i just found his character to be lightweight and his ultimate motivations were pretty weak weve seen that so many times in so many movies i think that was my main gripe about him great review keith i hope that the ripple effects follow through to infinty war and arent just so easily resolved  just like in the comics  i like the direction marvel took with this and age of ultron still fun superhero films but with a slightly more serious and thought provoking streak
Apr 15 2022,positive, a cinematic superhero crossover to be reckoned with captain america civil war could have easily been a third avengers film given its dozen or more superhero characters whats more it contains rather weighty themes of revenge and how to deal with the sometimes tragic consequences of superhero actions under the clear idealism of chris evans titular cap the film tunnels through an emotional core to discover more than just rousing superhero action although theres plenty of that too in fact its superheroagainstsuperhero action creating a whole film out of the best parts of the avengers when the innersquabbles between earths mightiest heroes turned to blows among the best entries in the marvel cinematic universe thus far the entire production of civil war is a testament to the marvel film factory from its breathless set pieces to its sharp exploration of several characters all within an intricate plot directors anthony and joe russo who helmed the getsbettereverytime captain america the winter soldier show incredible confidence in their filmmaking resulting in a rare superhero film of entertainment and substance on a huge scale arriving on the heels of another superheroversussuperhero title batman v superman dawn of justice marvels film proves it doesnt require a dour tone to deliver a comic book spectacular with gravitas nor does every action scene require pitch darkness and rain initially warner bros wanted their dc mashup to debut on the same day as civil war marvel wouldnt give up the date and perhaps out of uncertainty about their muddled film warner bros soon shifted their release to over a month earlier a good thing too since the critical and fan reception of the former has been largely negative to abysmal whereas marvels latest confronts critics in fans but only in good ways indeed writers christopher markus and stephen mcfeely mcu writers since captain america the first avenger incorporateperhaps unintentionallyan echo of the current political climate where ultrapolarized parties cant stop fighting long enough to solve any real problems or think of the consequences of their infighting and yet the scripters imbue the material with plenty of levity during the 146minute production which somehow breezes by and feels light as a feather despite some heavy stuff happening onscreen civil war was adapted from the limited 20062007 comic book series of the same name written by mark millar and penciled by steve mcniven one of the best comic storylines this critic and former comic aficionado has ever read just as iron man 2008 launched a bold new era of superheroes and the avengers 2012 synthesized multiple heroes into an incredibly fun and engaging extravaganza the adaptation of civil war feels like a watershed moment in the mcu both from a story perspective and in terms of pure filmmaking winter soldier donned a 70s spythriller cover antman was a heist comedy and guardians of the galaxy was a scifi fantasy but the strength of civil wars narrative far outweighs the need to apply a preexisting genre however an infilm reference to the manchurian candidate wasnt by accident like john frankenheimers 1962 classic civil war features a brainwashed character dealing with the emotional downfall of his condition and like that film its also paranoid conceptually frightening and challenging at every turn at the end of winter soldier captain america and his friend sam wilson aka falcon anthony mackie began looking for caps old friend bucky sebastian stan a former mindcontrolled hydra assassin on the run and trying to remember his earlier self in the meantime a series of public incidents most prominently those in avengers age of ultron has led world governments to conceive the sokovia accords a document headed by the dogmatic secretary ross william hurt reprising his role as the governmental nut from the incredible hulk stating all superbeings are restricted from using their powers unless ordered to do so by the united nations feeling a grave sense of responsibility for lives lost in sokovia tony stark aka iron man robert downey jr signs away his superhero rights and asks others to sign as well hes joined by the synthetic person vision paul bettany the military man war machine don cheadle and shockingly black widow scarlett johansson the latter of whom seems to see both sides of the argument but refuses to fight the impending tide captain america doesnt see registering or restricting his superhuman heroism as a positive change he views it as putting a committee in charge possibly subjecting the avengers to specific political agendas he finds sympathizers in falcon the unpredictable scarlet witch elizabeth olsen backoutofretirement hawkeye jeremy renner newly recruited antman paul rudd and eventually buckythough it was buckys alleged activities in the firsthalf of civil war that make any counterargument to the sokovia accord impossible those who refuse to sign and use their superpowers anyway become wanted theyre soon tracked down by ross and thrown into a floating prison in the sea inevitably as cap tries to protect his friend bucky from those who would take him out the ideologies implode and friends face one another on the battlefield from there the story becomes more complicated with the inclusion of daniel brühls mysterious character zemo who schemes to get closer to bucky for reasons unknown although the presence of zemo should not be overlooked brühl makes a nefarious tragically influenced villain the most nuanced performances belong to evans and downey as one might expect despite his characters allamerican frontage steve rogers has been increasingly disenchanted by the modern world his 40s idealism rocked by harsh doses of todays cruel reality evans carries that pain under the surface with a justdetectable sadness beneath his unpopular optimism and johanssons role furthers that sadness with her characters similar duality downey offers stark the first moments of genuine emotion weve seen from the everquipping character for several marvel films deepening his conviction and showing a more responsible weighed down and wounded character since both cap and iron man are devoted to the ideologies concerning superhero registration the depth of the team members who join forces with them are enhanced through associationthough many of them may have only one or two scenes to shine still the roles deepen even further by the final fight inciting audible gasps at a latefilm development that few will see coming because its a horrifying revelation more than a twist most crucial to the story in terms of new marvel characters appearing in the mcu is chadwick bosemans tchalla aka black panther whose african home wakanda is the source of vibranium and who gets his own solo film in 2018 when his father is slain presumably by bucky tchalla seeks revenge but hes not so blinded by his rage as other characters also appearing is youngster tom hollands spiderman the character brokered from sony in a landmark deal though the teenaged webslinging hero played a pivotal role in the comic storyline its lessened here somewhat of a letdown to the comic series readers but no less welcomed holland shines in his few scenes though this marks the third onscreen iteration of spidey and its hard to say yet whether holland will surpass tobey maguire though he shouldnt have any trouble outperforming andrew garfield well find out for certain when hollands solo film spiderman homecoming debuts in 2017 the film also contains a fine supporting cast marisa tomei makes her first appearance as peter parkers quite young aunt may john slattery and hope davis appear as tony starks parents martin freeman has a distractingly small role as a task force commander working with secretary ross alfre woodard john kani and of course stan lee appear as well theres also a nice romance developing between cap and sharon carter emily vancamp the former shield agent assigned to keep tabs on him and peggy carters niece each action set piecewith the exception of the shakycam opener set in lagos featuring winter soldiers frank grillo as the villain crossboneslooks amazing and showcases impressive choreography stunt work and special fx this is all standard for the mcu of course when bucky or cap strikes someone and that unfortunate person goes flying across the room the audiences feels it as the poor sap crashes into a wall and leaves a dent or flies right through said wall most impressive is the sixonsix battle at an airport where the films engorged roster of superheroes clash in a wowing sequence here we see supporting players like antman rudd is as jokey as ever and spiderman also very talky which falcon points out showcase their abilities in surprising ways fortunately the potential for collateral damage has been mitigated in this rumble allowing viewers to lose themselves the sheer spectacle of watching our favorite onscreen heroes do battle with one another without risk of the needless death that incited the entire film only the avengers outperforms civil war in terms of earthbound size and scope after the dust settles and our heroes have begun to lick their wounds instead of inflicting more of them were left with much to consider about the role of superpowered characters in the mcu its nice to know the filmmakers are weighing these ideas in a serious way these superheroes inhabit a world in which people die in that sense its very realistic in spite of the inclusion of intergalactic gemstones gamma radiation mutants and alternate spatial realms the survivors of superhero violence have some very strong feelings about whats happened to their loved ones with any luck some tense postfilm debates will take place among viewers because civil war doesnt provide a right answer nor does it pick a side locking up superheroes who refuse to sign a piece of paper seems dangerous because without them a villain could do harm to countless innocents on the other hand how does the public reconcile when hundreds or even thousands are left dead after the events of the avengers age of ultron human beings need someone to blame when something bad happens and superhumans are not immune to this captain america civil war creates a filmic conversation about this theme and amid some remarkable escapist awe leaves us thinking about its effect on our heroes in a purely dramatic way
Feb 14 2022,positive, in the 8 years that the marvel cinematic universe has been around the films have gone from franchiseuniverse establishing films to a theyll come no matter what we give them mindset while no mcu film is overtly terrible the last 2 films have shown the marvel cinematic universe in sit back mode as they have been concerned about their films continuing a story rather than be an original film adding depth and story to their characters captain america civil war has shown that when marvel wants to it can provide a breathtaking actionfilled political drama and a heartfelt story that will make even the casual film goer want more and more of it while a big fan of the civil war story arch in the marvel comics the path the russo brothers took with the film is just as breathtaking the films importance of accountability leads to the tension between the avengers the government feels that the designated good guys are responsible for the deaths of innocents despite the many they have saved for this a registration act is put in place in which the avengers must register abiding by governmental rules and requests they can only act if they are approved to do so this sets in motion a chain of events that leads to our superheroes taking sides and a back and forth fight that leads to one of the finest action sequences ive ever seen in film the russo brothers do not steer towards one side as any cinephile watching this film will undoubtedly understand they show both sides reasoning for signing and refusing to sign the registration act the motives of each character are made clear and the new characters introduced within the film gain a strong development and purpose for being in the film the added depth to tony stark and his character is a warm welcome unseen since the first iron man robert downey jr portrays tonys internal conflict magnificently the surprising best in show performance goes to tom holland as spiderman i have never been a big spiderman fan but holland stole every scene he was in and truly took spidey right out of the comic book and onto the big screen the way we all have wanted for years captain america civil war is the best entry into mcu next to the dark knight one of the best comic book films of all time from top to bottom this film is brilliant dc comics take notes this is not just how someone should direct a film but what a comic book film should look like and a great film should be
Jan 2 2022,positive,like their previous work with captain america the russo brothers make this movie a bit darker than their predecessors within the mcu but without losing the humorous tone that has always characterized the studios stories full review in spanish
Oct 9 2021,positive, as marvel closes out its second phase of movies with antman it opens up the next phase in their nonstop superhero money making machine with captain america civil war seemingly the last in a trilogy of captain america movies civil war is a strong opening to the third phrase it addresses a lot of the standing issues after ultron it plays on all the most powerful dynamics within the avengers and it successfully brings in a new line of characters while strengthening the relationship between the cast but is it really even a captain america movie the plot deals with the traditional issue of superhero registration within the marvel comic book universe something that sparked the original civil war between superheroes but the mcu has played it a different way with the identities of all our superheroes leaked by nat keeping superhero identities a secret isnt exactly a big deal anymore instead they focus on oversight for the avengers signing what is called the sokovia accords  a document that places strong boundaries on the avengers by the united nations  intended to keep them in check after the devastating results of sokovia the fall of shield and the attack on new york the world feels more threatened than safe with the avengers around tony appropriately bearing a large part of the blame for ultrons actions feels responsible for the deaths that they left in their wake hes ready for boundaries because he honestly thinks thats what they need hes a man who has never been kept on a leash and after reaching the height of his own genius and hubris hes fallen fast and hard meanwhile steve sees the accords as a shift of blame and a political tool instead of protecting the people they can be manipulated by the terms of the accord their agency is taken away and they are left simply as tools for the united nations all political powers have agendas and what happens when their agendas dont match hes a man who has been a soldier hes seen what power can be in the wrong hands hes not ready to be treated like a puppet disneycivil war feels much more like a story between cap and tony they have a push and pull that theyve been dancing around since the avengers despite this being a movie with captain americas name on the billboard it hinges heaviest on tony it touches on tonys past on the starks as a family on tonys guilt on tonys ego on tonys pain and loss you might be buying a ticket for captain america civil war but youre actually watching ironman vs captain america dawn of more avengers while theres nothing actually wrong with the movie  it touches on some very classic tropes of heroism and guilt and collateral damage  this is undoubtedly an avengers movie all of the fight scenes include the avengers all of the dialogue revolves around them and its conclusion suggests more about the avengers than cap this poses the question of whether its possible to have a standalone captain america story ever again if you were to only watch captain america the first avenger and captain america winter soldier youd be lost but thats the confidence of marvel studios they rely heavily on the fact that its target audience are loyal marvel fans and lets be real most of us are marvel has undoubtedly summited the mountain of popular opinion and come out on top its becoming more and more obvious that in order to keep up with the stories that marvel tells you can not be a casual viewer disneyhow will this fair for some of the lesser known avengers in the group who are getting their own movies theres no doubt that tom hollands spiderman will be safe after the incredibly gratuitous welcome he gets in civil war hes projected to be welcomed into the mcu with open arms what about black panther chadwick bosemans role as tchalla the newly made king of wakanda is damn near perfect and his part within civil war should chase away any doubt of the standalone film bosemans performance is genuine and incredibly warm and his story thematically falls in line with many of the other heroes if anything civil war is a better launching pad for the future of the franchise than it is for caps personal story his momentous battle with tony is poised as the climax in this film but it is downplayed as he leaves with bucky in tow and puts the winter soldier back into stasis for many people wondering if either sam wilson or bucky would pick up the shield after steve leaves especially with chris evans contract running out after infinity war its unclear what will happen steve drops his shield and abandons the mantle completely it leaves us wondering where they are going to take the avengers and steves mantle of captain america despite a confusion in titles and a protagonist civil war is a solid superhero movie it widely surpasses ultron which feels clunky and suffers from delusions of grandeur and it improves upon the same emotional quality of marvels the avengers while adding more depth and better action while facing the task of maneuvering a story full of main characters the russos manage to touch on each character a little bit while focusing on the civil war between tony and steve even with a huge cast that has the potential to drown out cap it still highlights some of the best aspects of cap hes the golden boy and the ideal hes a good man who doesnt feel disingenuous or overbloated sure hes the leader of the avengers but hes still that underdog from brooklyn hes incredibly likable and loyal to a fault while theres a lot to dislike about tony  and really you could blame this entire thing on him  steve can only really be blamed for wanting to see the best in people and trusting in them infallibly disneythe scenes with steve and sam and bucky stand in place of simply seeing cap go at it alone but the trio have such great chemistry together its actually a wise choice sam brings cap down to earth and bucky connects to the man behind the shield they both are able to treat him simply as steve buckys role in civil war despite having the whole movie named after his character is much larger than winter soldier he plays an indispensable part of catalyzing the civil war and sebastian stan makes a mark as one of the most interesting new characters that should see a rise in phase 3 given his status at the end of the film its a little unclear as to how that will happen but as a fan favorite and given the depth of emotional treasure you can mine from his relationship with characters like steve and tony its doubtful hell be in stasis for long daniel brühls colonel zemo who is more a catalyst than a true villain wanda and visions relationship and my surprise at marvel actually attempting this ship with some measure of success antmans hilariously powerful new ability sharon carters expanded role and relationship in caps life chadwick bosemans origins as black panther tonys surprisingly deep evolution as a character and of course the amazing spiderman brühls adaptation of zemo fits perfectly within the scope of the universe hes no crazed hydra supporter hes a broken man bent on revenge hes another victim and creation of the avengers callous decisions hes not a man without purpose and hes the first to understand that in order to defeat the most powerful team in the world he must destroy them from the inside out his plan isnt to unleash super soldiers but to lure them in and break the team apart completely to take away everything that the avengers have taken away from him if youre keeping  count hes pretty much successful he can call this op a win even if he is locked away wanda and vision share a romantic relationship within the comic books and although it seems difficult to imagine in reality civil war actually takes the time to not only flesh out wandas character and relationship with bigbrosteverogers but also a potential relationship with vision wanda is still pretty powerful within the mcu  lesser than her comic book counterpart  but she can really find an equal with vision the two of them share a connection through infinity gems and im honestly looking forward to this weird relationship come infinity war disneypaul rudd makes a great entrance to the avengers as scott lang and is equally impressive in the team cap vs team ironman fight as he debuts his powers of maximizing himself into giant antman if you somehow havent seen antman you need to it stands as one of my favorite mcu movies for working off the beaten path and scott proves himself to be a strong individual against the other avengers also hank pym always said not to trust a stark same hank same emily vancamp reprises her role as sharon carter playing on her chemistry with steve from winter soldier although its hard not to hold a torch for peggy and steve this movie made a good case for sharon as a standalone character she shares a lot of her aunt peggys personality traits shes tough determined loyal and stands firm in her beliefs her interactions with steve are compelling but despite their budding relationship and its potential it feels a bit rushed to suddenly have him making out with her this is a relationship that needs to be expanded on and not pushed theres a lot of good potential for expansion between the two of them a story that developed perfectly in civil war was tchallas story his mission of revenge really gilds the essential themes of the plot when crossbones attacks in wakanda and the avengers are sent out to deal with him the mission ends in another building destroyed and more civilians harmed tchallas father is one of the leaders who calls for the sokovia accords and when the un building is bombed supposedly by bucky and his father is killed its heart wrenching of course a superheros father dying is hardly striking at new ground but it never fails to gain empathy if done correctly his mission of revenge against bucky fuels many of his actions and yet his reconciliation of his vengeance plays out as authentic even if his revelation is largely offscreen his interaction with zemo the true killer of his father is muted and defined by nuance between the two strong characters bosemans tchalla is definitely one to keep an eye on disneytony spends much of the movie being the most conflicting character although i rag on him a lot and i share a pretty strong hatred for him sometimes he is one of the most diverse and dimensional characters he stands as a strong foil to steve but also as a character that has truly grown from the first version of himself nearly a decade ago struggling with his actions and the results of his ego he waffles between loyalties being ironman hasnt changed his personality hes still brash and arrogant lashing out at his friends and allies when his temper flares but hes a man with more scars than when he started hes a much more broken man in civil war he and pepper have hit a rough patch hes plagued by guilt hes haunted by ghosts hes just trying to keep it all together the accords are seemingly his penitence and he readily signs himself away hoping to absolve his sins but not only does this cause a huge rift between his friends but it does the opposite of what he hopes it to do he wants resolution some sort of peace for all the wrongs theyve committed but instead he only finds more conflict through the story he struggles with steve in trying to appease him and keep their group together he locks bucky away he keeps wanda in her room he confines steve and sam he does his best to conform to the wishes of the accords while trying to preserve what he has its a thin thread that keeps it all together but it snaps so easily he must fight his allies and his friends he sees rhodey suffer a shocking fall from the skies that paralyzes him he uncovers the truth about the death of his parents and all this culminates up to severing the avengers the end of civil war only sees the beginning of a resolution between him and steve through steves letter it isnt an apology but its a sort of understanding the two part on bad terms with steve incapacitating tonys suit by slamming his shield into the arc reactor and leaving his shield behind while this letter doesnt settle their differences it does open a path to potentially mending their group its one of the most compelling relationships in marvel and the russos do it justice disneyand then theres spiderman tom holland makes his debut as the nerdy fanboy peter parker already suited as an amateur spiderman and living with his much younger aunt may played by marisa tomei and here is where i have a serious gripe with the movie its very clear that they are playing out some of the most likable traits of spiderman with his character largely being a caricature of the beloved webslinger the way tony recruits him while funny given their pithy repartée is rife with questionable motives lets think about it this is a minor a teenager that tony plucks from a relatively safe home and recruits into his personal war tony doesnt recruit him as an avenger he recruits him as backup for team ironman to faceoff against captain america he brings in a child to fight his battles and be his muscle hell peters first impression of the avengers is that they fight viciously amongst themselves and are willing to damn near kill each other in order to achieve their personal goals peter doesnt make it out without some bumps and bruises from being tossed around what tony is willing to do and use the avengers for seemingly has no limits even as he draws boundaries for himself he continues to step outside of them hes a conflicting character and it plays heavily in characters like peter and wanda disneysome of the most problematic scenes lie in what happens to avengers who step out of line they are jailed and kept locked up without trial or jury and while characters like clint and scott are simply locked up wandas imprisonment looks and feels so deeply wrong shes tied up in a way that harkens back to the days of asylums he spends the majority of the film imprisoning wanda in one way or another and this type of protectiveyetrestrictive characteristic really doesnt look good on him ultimately civil war feels like more of a conclusive chapter for the mcu than it does as a new beginning new characters are introduced but the main plotline concerning the characters we already know is frayed at the ends and we are left with a massive weight of uncertainty in where we will go and how we will end up fighting together again during infinity war final thoughts captain america civil war is hardly the best cap movie it stands more staunchly as a fight between steve and tony spending an equal amount of time on both characters it is one of the most involved films in the mcu to date requiring a vast amount of previous knowledge to understand the implications of the plot however after the tragically shaky plot by joss whedon for age of ultron the russos take on marvels civil war is refreshing and bookends two phases of the largely successful marvel cinematic universe

Aug 27 2021,positive, the great anticipation thats been building up since the last avengers film is finally over captain america civil war bounded into the theaters this past weekend with all the superheroes one could possibly want with the exception of thor and hulk oh well i suppose we cant have everything although billed as a captain america film it might as well have been avengers 3 the film begins as cap chris evans and scarlet witchwanda maximoff elizabeth olsen fight some bad guys in lagos they win of course but wanda makes a mistake and lives are lost back on home turf secretary of state ross william hurt tells them its time for a change the avengers need to take responsibility for their actions they need oversight and the un is willing to assign that oversight in the form of the sokovia accords the accords say that the avengers will have bosses and the bosses get to decide where they go and what they do tony stark robert downey jr thinks they should sign the accords but captain america does not captain america civil war delivers on every level the eyepopping action moves the story forward and the humor brings the tension down a notch or two my favorite parts of the big showdown between team cap and team iron man were the introduction of spider man tom holland and ant man paul rudd both went totally fan boy upon meeting the avengers and as they fight they throw out great one liners like you have a metal arm cool from the perspective of values the film provides much to talk about the central issue that causes the civil war is not a black and white one should they sign the sokovia accords and give up their freedom to exercise their superness as they see fit or give the sayso to others iron man and his supporters want to sign for good reasons but captain america and his supporters dont want to sign for equally good reasons but instead of sitting down and talking it out they fight if any of the avengers were spiritual or religious people they might have done well to ask the holy spirit for guidance they still may have disagreed but maybe they could have avoided the fight which had its own tragic consequences as each avenger chooses sides for hisher own reasons the opportunities to talk things out continue to diminish the more personal wedge between cap and iron man comes in the form of bucky barneswinter soldier the loyalty that capsteve rogers shows to his childhood friend made me think that every person should have such a fiercely loyal friend the hurt suffered by tony stark requires forgiveness but tony is not emotionally able to forgive again neither one of them is right or wrong they just approach the situation with different mindsets can they work it out what might you do in this situation i dont want to give away anything by delving too deeply but here are some other themes worthy of mindful conversation once youve seen the film conviction selfsacrifice hurtful manipulation taking responsibility forgiveness reconciliation discernment friendship and justice sister hosea rupprecht is a member of the daughters of st paul a religious community dedicated to evangelization with the media she holds a master of theological studies degree from the university of st michaels college in toronto and an ma in media literacy from webster university in st louis  sr hosea is director of the east coast office of the pauline center for media studies based in staten island ny and speaks on media literacy and faith to catechists parents youth and young adults together with father chip hines she is the cohost of searchlight a catholic movie review show on catholic tv sr hosea is the author of how to watch movies with kids a valuesbased strategy released by pauline books  media  for the past 15 years she has facilitated various film dialogues for both children and adults as well as given presentations on integrating culture faith and media our mission the daughters of saint paul are an international congregation of women religious called consecrated and sent to evangelize in the spirit of st paul through our lives and all forms of media we are present in 50 nations with over 2500 sisters carrying out the pauline mission around the world 
Aug 18 2021,positive, in the long run its unlikely the notion of team cap or team iron man will take root in the cultural lexicon in the same manner as say team beatles or team elvis or even team boxers or team briefs but thats mainly because team marvel overpowers them both in an era when superhero flicks hit theaters with the same frequency as bugs hit windshields captain america civil war still manages to rise above the fray and declare itself one of the finest pictures yet from team stan lee or should this thing have been called avengers civil war it could certainly go both ways with no less than 12 superheroes on display this clearly isnt a oneman show at the same time its apparent that captain america as always played to perfection by chris evans is the principal character in this chapter of the ongoing saga more personally tied to the proceedings thanks to the involvement of his childhood friend bucky barnes sebastian stan now known and feared as the winter soldier directors anthony russo and joe russo and scripters christopher markus and stephen mcfeely are able to make civil war feel like a direct followup to both 2014s captain america the winter soldier and 2015s avengers age of ultron intriguingly it shares narrative material with the lambasted batman v superman dawn of justice with a discussion of whether superheroes should be allowed to roam  and fight  as they please or whether there should be some sort of governmental oversight when their actions lead to collateral damage this issue comes to a head right at the beginning of this picture as civilian deaths lead both the us government repped by william hurt and the united nations to propose a resolution wherein the avengers will only act when given permission by these bodies and heres where the movie really starts to flex its intelligence since it would be logical to assume that the patriotic bythebook capsteve rogers would be the one to agree to this and the arrogant maverick iron mantony stark robert downey jr would be the one to snort and walk away but after the events of captain america the winter soldier wherein steve witnessed corruption at the highest levels of government hes no longer the alltrusting innocent and he balks at this executive order stark on the other hand is haunted by a number of deaths  many at the hands of his creation ultron  and he thinks that maybe the avengers should be reined in a bit the line in the sand becomes even more pronounced once bucky is fingered for a terrorist bombing and rogers comes to his aid thereby establishing himself and his allies as fugitives some like war machinejames rhodes don cheadle and vision paul bettany strongly side with iron man others such as the scarlet witchwanda maximoff elizabeth olsen and hawkeyeclint barton jeremy renner firmly align themselves with cap and with heroes to the left of her heroes to the right heres black widow scarlett johansson stuck in the middle black widow aka natasha romanoff continues to be perhaps the most fascinating and complex character in this marvel world order smart brave witty troubled and able to read people and situations better than most of the others shes a dynamic figure  gee you think somebody would give her a movie of her own theres very little that captain america civil war does wrong after avengers age of ultron which allowed too much bloat to get in the way of some socko individual scenes this one establishes a beautiful balance between quieter characterdriven sequences and splashy action setpieces the airport skirmish goes on a tad too long for my liking but since its clearly the movies showcase moment others doubtless wont complain tom holland is introduced as the new spidermanpeter parker and after the miscasting of andrew garfield in those underwhelming amazing spiderhipster flicks hes simply divine the geeky motormouth teen we all know and love  along with anthony mackies falconsam wilson and paul rudds antmanscott lang he provides most of the films knowing laughs also new to the roster is tchalla chadwick boseman further demonstrating his range following his jackie robinson in 42 and his james brown in get on up african royalty who dons the sleek duds to fight crime as the black panther tchallas involvement in the proceedings ultimately becomes as personal as steves and he figures in many of the pictures best moments finally theres the villain of the piece zemo daniel bruhl so excellent as rushs niki lauda an ordinary man as opposed to the godlike likes of loki and ultron never missing a chance to add twisty issues of morality to their saga markus and mcfeely provide even zemo with enough backstory to make his reasons for his wrongdoing impossible to dismiss out of hand and yes theres the requisite cameo by the one and only stan lee the marvel maestro has now clocked appearances in over two dozen superhero films but his brief bit here ranks among the best so does the movie itself
Aug 5 2021,positive,  now that they are 13 movies into the marvel cinematic universe marvel president kevin feige and the rest of his brain trust can do almost whatever they want and have it be successful the latest captain america civil war is an avengers movie without being called one by name a subtle difference that allows it to advance the larger mcu narrative while still telling a standalone story  following the last captain america movie the winter soldier and avengers 2 steve rogers chris evans finds himself at a crossroads personally and professionally fallout from avengers missions around the globe have led to a call for greater oversight on the superhero group an idea rogers objects to but one which tony stark robert downey jr thinks might be necessary  when rogers old friendnew nemesis bucky barnes sebastian stan is accused of a bombing he may or may not have committed the disagreement reaches a boil pitting not only captain america against iron man but also forcing other avengers like black widow scarlett johansson falcon anthony mackie war machine don cheadle and hawkeye jeremy renner to choose sides  coming so soon after another superhero faceoff in batman v superman itd be easy to dismiss this movie as a tired unimaginative way to insert conflict where none is needed but directors anthony and joe russo and screenwriters christopher markus and stephen mcfeely make the movie about way more than just the spectacle of the superheroes fighting each other  for one they keep the story relatively focused allowing the details of the escalating argument to be laid out in precise and understandable terms side stories such as the introduction of tchallablack panther chadwick boseman are integrated so well into the flow of the plot that they never become a distraction  and they also introduce real human emotions into the proceedings a concept that is often foreign to superhero movies the concern over the unintentional but tangible damage the avengers exploits cause sets the stage for final act revelations that are relatable to anybody superhero or not  if youre a fan of the patented lighthearted tone of the mcu you wont be disappointed despite the heaviness of much of the film the big clash between the two sides is notable as much for its great action as it is for the quips that fly back and forth the presence of new recruits antman paul rudd and spiderman tom holland help this aspect immensely theyre there as much for comic relief as for their fighting prowess  most of the actors have perfected their takes on their respective roles leaving any critiques of their performances null and void newcomers like boseman and holland fit in seamlessly while daniel bruhl offers a nice respite as the lowkey villain zemo captain america civil war shows that the overseers of the mcu have yet to rest on their laurels if anything given the coming onslaught of star wars movies and renewed interest in the dc comics universe this film indicates that they are redoubling their efforts to prove their dominance is well founded editors note a lot happened this week so heres your chance to get caught up read on for the

Jun 24 2021,positive, phase 3 of the marvel cinematic universe kicked off with a bang all of the avengers minus hulk and thor are present in what is basically avengers 25 and theyre forced to face the music for all of the casualties that they may or may not be responsible for while theyve been off superheroing similar to the start of phase 2 we start this section of the mcu with the end of the trilogy of one of our major heroes despite civil war being filled to the brim with returning characters as well as a couple of new ones it is still very much a captain america movie when an avengers mission in lagos nigeria is botched and several civilians are killed the united nations comes together to draft the sokovia accords legislation that would put the avengers under government supervision signed by 117 countries tony stark reeling from the consequences of his actions in age of ultron and well every other film is the first to sign up tonys entire story has been about accountability and the dangers of unchecked power we need to be put in check whatever form that takes im game if we cant accept limitations were boundaryless were no better than the bad guys steve rogers disagrees as someone who has seen firsthand the problems of government authority and oversight he knows that the safest hands are their own steve views signing the accords as a way of throwing in the towel and not taking responsibility for their actions to steve the united nations is still run by people with agendas and agendas change if we sign these we surrender our right to choose what if this panel sends us somewhere we dont think we should go what if theres somewhere we need to go and they dont let us theres no real right or wrong answer here though im team cap all the way both sides of the argument have strong legs to stand on steve and tonys stances are directly influenced by their previous experiences and ideals throughout multiple films and this is what makes civil war the first real payoff for marvel for all of those years of storytelling we know both characters like the back of our hand at this point so we understand where both are coming from and why they choose the side they choose this journey through eight years and twelve films have left us with quite an emotional investment so the tragedy of what steve and tonys disagreement turns into resonates strongly with any fan of this universe while the plot of the film is a direct response to ending of age of ultron it also is a continuation of the story that began in the winter soldier bucky barnes has been on the lamb since the fall of shield but when he is framed for bombing the un he becomes the number one target around the world steve buries his former love peggy carter and now the only remaining part of the life he once had is bucky and he will do anything to save and protect his best friend even if it means becoming an international criminal by assisting him the final chapter of the captain america trilogy seeks to explore the man behind the shield and we finally learn how steve rogers may not be so perfect after all steve rogers flaw and weakness is bucky steve is thrown off his game and hesitates at the mere mention of buckys name during the mission in lagos which leads to the death of innocents he forfeits his position as leader of the avengers to find and protect bucky and is labeled as a war criminal in doing so in the end he gets half of the avengers team hurt and imprisoned and loses the friendship and respect of tony all in his quest to protect bucky steve loves bucky more than anyone no matter how close hes become to his friends like sam and natasha they pale in comparison to his relationship with bucky bucky was there for steve when he had no one else in his life and protected him through it all now their roles are reversed and steve cannot sit idly by while others seek to kill his friend even if the consequences for doing so are steep how nice to finally find a flaw zemos plan is to tear the avengers apart from the inside fueling the fire made by the accords until they can no longer function as a team and collapse an empire toppled by its enemies can rise again but one which crumbles from within thats dead forever zemo poses no physical threat to our heroes challenging them instead strictly through scheming and manipulation he has no ties to hydra in fact he kills a hydra agent during his quest or any other evil organization throughout the film it even seems as if hes questioning what hes doing having to listen to the final voicemail left by his wife over and over to remind himself why hes on this mission and once his plan is complete with the avengers splintered imprisoned and their two leaders fighting to the death below him there is no glory in it for him and little satisfaction he listens to the voicemail one last time deletes it and then attempts to put a bullet through his brain zemos plan may be a bit convoluted with too many moving pieces that are required to go exactly right at the exact right time but hes a fresh take on what a villain can be in a superhero film and i think hes a wonderful addition to the mcu the many years and films that marvel studios spent world and character building are what makes civil war work so well its a film that you really do need to have seen the previous films to understand and it takes all thats come before to turn in a film thats both a huge spectacle the airport battle was the entire selling point and an emotional gutpunch the russos are firing on all fronts between winter soldier and civil war they show that they truly understand each character in the mcu roster and can deliver personal stories within a large cast i struggle in deciding which film of theirs is the superior one but both are the best of the best that marvel has had to offer and its why theyve been entrusted with infinity war and avengers 4 black panther and spiderman are fantastic additions to the marvel universe tchalla instantly became one of the coolest heroes with one of the coolest suits and even with all thats going on in civil war gets his own character arc centered around not allowing vengeance to consume him as it consumes everyone else around him spiderman just being in this movie is a miracle in itself a pipe dream that i didnt think id ever get to see tom holland is tremendous showing us in his first scene who peter parker is what hes all about with his own version of with great power comes great responsibility he and antman bring the fun and the laughs in an otherwise somber film the russos continue to show off their gift for crafting action sequences the airport battle is the most fun and thrilling set piece since the battle of new york in the first avengers and tony and steves fight is brutal becoming the most violent and bloodiest conflict weve seen in the mcu thus far would civil war have been better more impactful if one of the heroes had died it would have definitely been more dramatic but i like the russos response to this civil war is about the separation and divorce of a family if we had killed someone off it would have turned into being about a death in the family instead which wasnt what we were going for of course thats not to say that there are no consequences in the film there are plenty phase 3 of the marvel cinematic universe is about the end of what we know and whats come before as well as the birth of the new generation and the heroes they have to offer the avengers as we know them have to end and make way for the new no matter how much it pains us to witness it iron mans trilogy ends with him choosing to always be iron man even without his suits and weapons and gadgets captain americas trilogy ends with him tossing his shield aside and with it the title and mantle of captain america the government he fought for has betrayed him and the rest of the world has branded him a traitor and a criminal steves choice to stand firm in his beliefs against almost everyone else is solidified in peggys death and hearing her words at the funeral compromise where you can where you cant dont even if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right even if the whole world is telling you to move it is your duty to plant yourself like a tree look them in the eye and say no you move steve rogers chooses to be himself to operate under no orders but his own and to protect the world and its people without a banner you wear a flag on your chest and think you fight a battle of nations the red skull says to him at the end of the first avenger i have seen the future captain there are no flags these words carry ominous weight all these years later steves identity is no longer tied to his country nor is it even tied to the avengers yet he is still the hero the country and the rest of the world needs even after their fight steve leaves tony with a way to contact him if he ever needs him and we know he will always answer the call because he is what he promised to be to dr erskine the man who gave him his life and power a good man if i see a situation pointed south i cant ignore it and he doesnt wish he could captain america civil war marks a change in the entire dynamic of the avengers and the mcu as a whole it was the first satisfying reward for all of the time and years spent invested in these characters and the world they live in the conflict is fascinating i could watch an entire film of the characters just debating the accords and the personal stakes between steve and tony are heartbreaking the team is split and scattered leaving earth wide open for catastrophe that catastrophe is arriving in a big way very soon and unless our heroes can reunite they wont be able stop it nicolás delgadillo is a

Apr 27 2021,positive, if captain america civil war feels more substantial than most marvel movies its probably because its driven by a serious modernday issue accountability after the everexpanding superhero crew destroyed the fictional country of sokovia in last years avengers age of ultron the un wants them to be moderated by a governing body tony stark aka iron man robert downey jr leads a faction of avengers who agree to being regulated while steve rogers aka captain america chris evans heads up a group who oppose the move this deftly sets up the civil war of the title which intensifies when rogers friend bucky barnes aka winter soldier sebastian stan is accused perhaps wrongly of committing a terrorist act stark wants to bring in barnes for punishment but rogers is convinced his friend is innocent and sets out to protect him suddenly iron man is pitted against captain america not just ideologically but practically sparking an fiery avengers vs avengers battle that rages until the films finale along the way sibling directors anthony and joe russo who also helmed 2014s captain america the winter soldier do a better job of juggling a massive cast than joss whedon managed on avengers age of ultron scarlett johanssons black widow and martin freemans new bureaucrat character everett ross are frustratingly underused but the russos smoothly introduce two new avengers due to star in their own movies chadwick bosemans black panther is griefridden and intriguing while 19yearold british actor tom holland makes a promising debut as a younger more giddily enthusiastic spiderman than recent incarnations played by tobey maguire and andrew garfield  the russos action sequences are supremely gripping especially a nerveshattering scene in which it looks as though superstrong captain america might have his arm ripped off as he tries to pull down a helicopter during takeoff but its the tighter plotting and constant sense of conflict that makes this a superior superhero movie at 147 minutes captain america civil war is probably a bit too long but it has enough tense headtoheads and eyepopping fight scenes to override the odd drop in momentum
Feb 11 2021,negative, captain america civil war is the latest hollywood superhero film it is the 13th film from the marvel cinematic universe alone there are more on the way the new captain america is now the most commercially successful film of 2016 with its global box office revenue having reached 1 billion this past weekend it cost approximately 250 million to make the story of captain america civil war involves a dispute within the group of enhanced creatures known as the avengers over whether they should accept united nations supervision of their efforts to combat threats represented by various supervillains governments worldwide have become concerned about civilian casualties collateral damage resulting from the avengers destructive activities captain america  steve rogers chris evans leads the faction that opposes signing an agreement accepting un regulation of the superheroes conduct ironman  tony stark robert downey jr heads up those in favor a terrorist attack that is falsely attributed to rogers friend winter soldier  bucky barnes sebastian stan the victim of insidious brainwashing years ago in siberia becomes the source of further conflicts among the avengers hence the civil war in the films title it turns out that someone is deliberately stoking the bitter discord in the group hoping to fracture it permanently because of his own personal grievances joe and anthony russo directed captain america civil war the action sequences and there are many of them are often difficult to follow the relationships are simplistic and clichéd there are a few amusing lines in the nearly two and a half hour film there is also the nearly inevitable vaguely antirussian angle overall it is impossible to care about anyone and anything in this work there are no coherent or significant themes here civil war seems to be suggesting that the thirst for vengeance is unquenchable and selfdefeating every forceful actioneven in a good causeproduces new perhaps accidental victims and those who attempt to avenge the latter inevitably perpetuate the cycle of violence if this is meant to apply to the current geopolitical situation to the wars in the middle east and the terrorist attacks in europe it is less than meaningless since it conceals the reality of relentless us and european military violence and neocolonial aggression with its fleeting essentially inconsequential references to the deaths of innocent civilians the russo brothers effort deserves inclusion among those films and novels that acceptsometimes in allegorical formthe framework of the war on terror but suggest that good people or whatever form of life they may be can step over the line and that there may be a price to pay for the overzealous pursuit of evildoers in any event the issues and dilemmas facing the characters the gestures in the direction of psychology are mere scaffolding for a largescale moneymaking operation what passes for film criticism is so prostituted in the us at this point that hardly anyone can state the obvious that this is a bloated pointless and dull film which simply kills truly murders a few hours in the viewers life laughably justin chang in variety the trade publication calls it the most mature and substantive picture to have yet emerged from the marvel cinematic universe more cynically the hollywood reporter comments call it civil war or call it brand extension call it a cinematic universe or a corporate behemoththe latest marvel extravaganza furthers the studios crosspollination of action franchises in a way thats sure to satisfy devotees posing serious questions about violence and vigilantism while reveling in both captain america civil war is overlong but surprisingly light on its feet these comments are simply a form of product endorsement the american media instinctively subservient to corporate interests treats the studios and their blockbusters as invaluable national assets that are too big to fail it is a truly dreadful situation last july in a comment on terminator genisys 2015 we pointed to the phenomenon of socalled independent filmmakers moving into the blockbuster vortex as something worth taking note of the russo brothers were cited in that article as an example they wrote and directed their first film pieces 1997 while still graduate students at case western reserve university in their hometown of cleveland joe russo told an interviewer that this initial movie was a french new waveinfluenced nonlinear art piece that had no absolutely no appeal to anybody in commercial filmmaking he told another interviewer it was a genrebending movie it was about a heist but completely absurdist in the style of a jeanluc godard film and we grew up on foreign films art house films françois truffaut was a huge influence on us thanks to steven soderbergh and george clooney who had a production company together the russo brothers made their first feature film welcome to collinwood 2002 it was set in a rundown section of cleveland and based on italian filmmaker mario monicellis memorable comedy big deal on madonna street  i soliti ignoti 1958 about a group of smalltime thieves who horribly botch a burglary william h macy sam rockwell isaiah washington luis guzmán patricia clarkson jennifer esposito and clooney himself featured in the amusing work oddly enough another independent filmmaker who has found himself directing bombastic fare alan taylor thor the dark world 2013 and terminator genisys also began his career by directing a movie palookaville 1995 loosely inspired by monicellis film the russo brothers apparently played a role as well in developing the comic television series arrested development 200306 eventually directing 15 episodes between them after working on a number of other series the russos graduated to directing captain america the winter soldier 2014 and now this they are slated to direct two more avengers films infinity war part i and ii to be released in 2018 and 2019 respectively all one can think about is the terrible waste of resources technology and human skill represented by a film like captain america civil war the performers for instance include many talented individuals among them evans downey jr scarlett johansson anthony mackie don cheadle jeremy renner chadwick boseman paul bettany elizabeth olsen paul rudd daniel brühl william hurt martin freeman marisa tomei john slattery hope davis alfre woodard and others what are these people doing in this film is there any major film actor at present who would say no to this sort of project in any event the ultimate source of the problem lies in bad times not bad people what exists at present will be replaced by something very different its opposite in many respects
Jan 6 2021,negative, as with captain america the winter soldier directors anthony  joe russo and screenwriters christopher markus  stephen mcfeely spend so much time ensuring captain america civil war isnt bad that they forget to make it actually good their plotting is as carefullymanaged as their shot choices are incoherent and their characterbuilding outright timid this is fine for the cinemasins crowd for whom a films greatest virtue is to lack inconsistencies and contradictions you know human traits but not for anyone interested in art or the human spirit youd think a career in such masterful narratively economic sitcoms as arrested development and happy endings would make the russos better judges of how to effectively sketch characters in a group dynamic but all their resume really makes clear is the extent to which the conflict in this like a halfhour comedy just comes down to a crazy misunderstanding tony stark robert downey jr is feeling guilty his career as iron man has left him estranged from his girlfriend pepper and put him too close to death too often he is he hopes on his way towards retirement when yet another avengers mission leaves dozens of innocents dead a public outcry leads the united nations to demand an agreement that would put the superhero team under international supervision tonys in favor partially hoping some added oversight will minimize collateral damage and partially hoping the agreement will be the sort of compromise pepper might approve tony as always remains the only major character in the marvel cinematic universe with more than one layer and downey the only star whos developed his character through the series which brings us to steve rogers chris evans aka captain america who opposes the un plan he feels the avengers only works because they know whats right and cant count on everchanging leadership to retain a moral compass adding to his concern the international community is presently hunting one bucky barnes sebastian stan steves best friend from way back and more recently an expert assassin brainwashed by the villainous hydra organization see the winter soldier for this whole deal steve insists bucky either never did anything wrong or was under mind control when he did and isnt wild about the shootonsight order various government agencies have out for him so he goes after bucky himself hoping to figure out whats really going on the rest of the avengers  sans the inconvenientlypowerful thor and hulk but adding the lessdestructive black panther chadwick boseman and spiderman tom holland  are more or less split along party lines conveniently aligning so that the balance of superpower is not tilted in such a way that would decide the inevitable battle before it even starts its unclear whether helmut zemo daniel brühl a shadowy figure manipulating certain events from afar considered such balances as his evil plan slowly develops but then hes a pretty useless character anyway so lets not bother with him any further the film sure doesnt the general idea of captain america and iron man divided over government oversight and leading forces of fellow superheroes to battle one another is inspired by a massive 2006 event story from the comics but where that took forty years to build to and six months of innumerable tiein issues to tell the film compacts everything into a comparatively tight 140 minutes the predictable effect has many supporting characters hawkeye antman and spiderman especially fighting their friends for no discernible reason and the teams form so quickly that those of us who didnt watch the trailer fifty times mostly forget whos on whose side when the battle comes this would be tolerable if the muchhyped showdown was at all interesting its horribly managed pairing off various characters to fight one another in an endless series of fanservice sparring sessions that rarely relate to or build upon one another and flatter than the pages its adapting for as blandlylit and unimaginativelystaged as their dialogue scenes are its a shame the camera and lighting department wasnt accounted for in marvels massive budget the russos have an uncommonly bad eye for action the opening espionage sequence is a mess of handheld camerawork that neither conveys whats actually happening nor reaches the expressionist mayhem of our finer vulgar auteurs a tunnel car chase is astounding in its conception and choreography but only once you look past a shooting and editing scheme that lacks grace grit rhythm or perspective they cut incessantly never motivated by a new action or development but simply to account for every setup they produced the russos seem to have a camera everywhere without once putting it in the right place they see everything and express nothing it is remarkable then that the climactic showdown between tony steve and bucky is so resonant the stakes  once utterly arbitrary  are finally rendered in personal terms even steve is allowed to act as irrationally as tony their selfishness and pride overtaking their plotservicing motivation for five or ten minutes captain america civil war becomes the film it has been insisting upon but its the very definition of too little too late setting up a level of engagement it cannot resolve because wouldnt you know it theyve run out the clock and its time to wrap things up too tidily and too suddenly the films ideological sympathies were evident from the start but by the end theyre carried to too emotional a place to simply shrug them off usually such unconventional structure is admirable but when it cut to the end credits at by my estimation the start of its third act i felt shortchanged for all their faults marvel has done a pretty good job of telling contained stories that contribute to a larger whole not here this twoandahalf hour film with two protagonists nine key supporting players and four other notable stars couldnt even tell one story never mind narrative economy  wheres the story at all jesus man im not a fan of the mcu by any stretch but this is downright scathing it makes me want to see it more than a positive review would  the russos have an uncommonly bad eye for action the opening espionage sequence is a mess of handheld camerawork that neither conveys whats actually happening nor reaches the expressionist mayhem of our finer vulgar auteurs they relied so heavily on handheld vérité in winter solder and made almost no effort to make it a piece with the parts that can only be real in a comic book heres a neat scene of cap fighting guys in an elevator now heres cap jumping out of the elevator and falling 20 stories ugly needless avatarstyle handheld zoom and surviving and here is some helicopter shots of cap leaping from a motorcycle onto a harrier jet and defusing it singlehandedly they use the style so they can avoid stylistic decisions ones that would make sense because their audience is undemanding children who need a minimal amount of semaphore to conclude that this is a 70sstyle conspiracy thriller calum marsh really nailed it when he said something along the lines of oh so when you guys said winter soldier was a 70sstyle conspiracy thriller you meant a 90sera james bond movie this isnt to knock the latter as such and im not even a gigantic fan of three days of the condor or the parallax view but theres a pretty wide gulf there that serious people are still repeating this bit of ad copy two years later isunfortunate and im not against using vérité style amidst ridiculous stunts i think the bourne movies bridge this gap pretty effectively but the russos just dont have a sense of how to utilize it everything adds up in that you can more or less tell whats happening really just the bargainbasement level of expectations on a movie that costs as much as these do as you said though you still need to make decisions along the way  where to put the camera how long to hold there why youre cutting when you do everything about their visual scheme suggests they just set up as many cameras as they could anywhere they could to ensure it would all add up while i dont necessarily respond super well to how the russos approach action i will say that their chaotic sensibilities seem to make more sense for a handtohand combat type of film which is what we had in winter soldier which is why the elevator sequence worked so well for me captain america as a character operates on a much smaller level than other superheroes so it makes sense that the action would be cut from that bourne cloth its only when the action requires a more epic scale as in the big superhero battle in civil war that their instincts fail them so im now officially worried about the action in infinity war which will have a galactic scale that i dont think theyll be up to handling
Dec 4 2020,negative, hen an assault on a chemical facility in lagos breaks out captain america chris evans and several members of the avengers including iron man robert downey jr black widow scarlett johansson falcon anthony mackie and scarlet witch elizabeth olsen intervene to thwart the attempted theft of biohazardous material but their involvement comes at a price as numerous civilian casualties becomes the muchdebated result of the avengers latest efforts additionally resurfacing countless other forms of collateral damage from previous earthshattering clashes the world demands accountability from the crimefighting organization 117 countries agree on the sokovia accords a document outlining rules that the avengers must follow dictating how and when they can commit to action but when the un building in vienna is bombed on the day of the signing and bucky barnes aka the winter soldier sebastian stan is implicated in the attack captain america knows he must locate his elusive friend before the authorities do  in order to save his life while the first avenger heads to bucharest to look for barnes an arcane threat works from the shadows to cause a rift in the superhero alliance as iron man and captain america are forced to take opposing sides each leader recruits members old and new to aid in their fight for the truth clearly this third captain america movie might as well be the third avengers movie by anyones count there are more superheroes here than in any of the previous marvel epics but thats also part of the problem following the downward trend for entertainment value in the xmen movies this continuing chapter insists upon inventing all sorts of correlating types of kryptonite or more specifically technology or supervillains or superweapons to combat the new batch of superheroes and each new hero whether theyre extraterrestrial or some kind of mutant has special powers that would make them utterly invincible  were it not for the convenient countermeasure always within grasp of the antagonists and just out of reach of the authorities opening with the dullest of cold opens captain america civil war sets about establishing an exhaustingly circuitous plot of betrayal infighting espionage terrorism and covert operations inevitably all of this will lead to a cacophonous showdown in some abandoned arctic facility with revelations abounding but though a battle in icy confines isnt farfetched a sensible reason to bring every contending party together certainly eludes plausibility in fact the villains ploy is so unnecessarily complex that when the big reveal is finally laid bare its almost laughable in its simplicity as in last years terminator genisys with just a few slight modifications the film can easily undo the entire purpose behind its own existence i got lucky insists natasha after she emerges unscathed from a massive bombing of a united nations complex which practically crumbles around her just like before its a bit much to see normal humans regardless of martial arts training participate in hugely destructive skirmishes with alien beings and exceptionally advanced robotic warriors its as mindboggling as a scene early on when rogers and barnes attempt to escape a multistory apartment building as its consumed by military commandos  and they after agreeing to reform their deadly ways go to great lengths not to kill any of their adversaries but nothing stops them from seriously seriously injuring the majority of the nameless faceless soldiers despite the films excessive running time and the tired concept of governmental oversight placed on superheroes like watchmen or the incredibles or batman v superman dawn of justice  the diplomacy and politics of uncontainable creatures spoils the fun of vigilante justice or the belief in superhero righteousness  theres an undeniable element of fun to the action sequences although the backstories and character arcs are compounded to the point that seeing captain america civil war is a little like walking into a random episode from the fifth season of a television series the creativity involved with antmans tech or scarlet witchs inexplicable mastery of levitation and red mist or visions godlike capabilities which are also never given any definition whatsoever provide numerous opportunities for highoctane action and posing sadly a touch of amusing fight choreography cant save this overlong jumble of superhero cliches from succumbing to the absolute ridiculousness of nearly all the components that lead up to the anticipated civil war  as well as the silliness of black panther a man who can apparently don a skintight black suit and retractable claws and gain not only invincibility but also the power to defy gravity and physics an adolescent spiderman who appears really just for the sake of oneliners and hot aunt may marisa tomei showing up for half a scene and half a line of dialogue designed by mike

Nov 10 2020,positive, as the 2016 movie season approaches its midway mark its time to check it on whats been great good bad or just plain okay more importantly what you missed and need to see sometimes it takes a few days to truly know how good a film was a bad one stinks right away while this year hasnt produced a flawless gem just yet there have been a few great ones as the 2016 movie season approaches its midway mark its time to check it on whats been great good bad or just plain okay more importantly what you missed and need to see sometimes it takes a few days to truly know how good a film was a bad one stinks right away while this year hasnt produced a flawless gem just yet there have been a few great ones trust me i never thought the phrase a michael bay film would come together with top movie picks ever in my life sure the rock and pain and gain were something different but the near three hour brain bashing servings of transformers films negated a lot of the praise 13 hours was something different taking a page out of peter bergs lone survivor book bay told the brutal yet true story of six former soldiers turned mercenaries who make the fateful choice to defend a compound against rebels overnight risking life and limb john krasinski and james badgedale led a tough game cast and the film packed an emotional wallop when you left the theater you felt a piece of shrapnel sticking out of your heart the film stayed with you and provided bay with his best effort a truly visceral experience thank god ryan reynolds endured and wore sony pictures down over 10 years before finally getting the freedom to make his own wade wilson story he knocked it out of the park making arguably the coolest comic book film of the year and the most unfiltered take on the xmen mercenary the film plays well over multiple viewings and holds comedy to a higher standard than mere action and wise cracks reynolds takes shots at sony the xmen and anybody else wrong enough to stand in his path the man has always been talented but this film takes the cake for bringing all his skills to light deadpool 2 cant get here soon enough comic book film fan or not this film is a must see yes im grouping these two different yet eerily similar science fiction stories together because they both resonated on different levels the jeff nichols directed special starred michael shannon and jaeden lieberher as fatherson on the run from the fbi religious cults and various levels of authority in a mission to get to a certain location for a supposed special event telling you more would ruin too much and nichols heartfelt tale about the bond between parents and their kids deserves as little detail as possible special powers are involved and the end of the film delivers a sonic boom to your chest 10 cloverfield lane is a sequel to 2008s cloverfield in name only here the freak is laid on thick as john goodman keeps a confused yet willful mary elizabeth winstead captive in a basement for her own safetysupposedly unpredictable thrills twists and wow moments ensue each film is an original piece of work that levels you with a creativity rarely seen in hollywood today each are old school delights credit jake gyllenhaal for taking an ordinary looking role and turning it into something special and director jean marcvalleedallas buyers club wild for giving him the space to embody davis mitchell with a wounded grace that allowed for unpredictable events to follow the story of a widowed businessman who slowly dissembles his life in order to identify why he feels nothing after his wife dies in a car accident doesnt reinvent the wheel of film but truly carves a place in your heart for days after you may think you know where this lovely indie is going but you dont gyllenhaal giving yet another great performance as a man running in place doesnt hold a thing back without overdoing a single take this film slipped past you once dont let it happen again  the russo brothers are deadly ladies and gentlemen yeah two of my top five picks are superherocomic book related deal with it because like its predecessor winter soldier civil war says more about the current vulnerable state of the world than most films and political talk shows can assemble in 25 hours on the surface its one superhero against another deep down its two friends being separated due to a difference in idealogy oh and theres chadwick bosemans fantastic tease of the black panther robert downey jr and chris evans save their best work for this film because they make every punch and kick hurt and divide an audience into a cloud of confusion do you think heroes should be regulated or should they be able to act when they think it is right what happens when the good guys square off against each other sure frank grillos crossbones threw a wrench into their plans and daniel bruhls colonel zemo lit the fire before the match but this quarrel has brewed for a few films now the result isnt just an exciting popcorn film but instead a cool and thoughtful expose on the difference between heroism and vigilantism it was nearly two hours and 30 minutes and i didnt want it to end  are either of these films legit 55 films advertise in the middle of the street type cinematic masterpieces probably not 2016 hasnt driven me to take a long walk after a moviefruitvale station or made me smile continuously for hourschef nor left me with a worthy hole in my stomachlone survivor or end of watch these six films are legit delights and require your attention they offer something different exciting honest and thrilling watch them and tell me what you thought 
Sep 4 2020,positive, when listing the credits for captain america civil war it was mighty tempting under starring to simply put everyone i mean seriously who isnt in captain america civil war  heres the thing it works i admit this somewhat begrudgingly but its hard to picture too many devotees of the marvel universe being unhappy with anything that unfolds in this nearly 2 12 hour long widely anticipated adventure that plants more seeds than invasion of the body snatchers  captain america civil war is neither as brilliant as some will proclaim it to be nor is it anywhere near a middleoftheroad popcorn flick in fact captain america civil war is a damn near perfect popcorn flick though it is worth saying that it is in fact a popcorn flick in short captain america civil war serves up one hell of a good time but if the words one of the best films ever are flying out of your mouth then youd best be a preteen a masturbatory fanboy or a film critic prepared to fork over your journalistic credentials after a year that has already brought us the satisfying selfimportance of batman v superman and the humorous nihilism of deadpool captain america civil war is marvel at the top of its game offering up what may very well be its finest cinematic effort yet and at minimum a film certainly in its top three were talking about the serious collateral damage when these superheroes do superhero things that dont quite always end up with superheroic results you know like people die a lot of people die a lot of buildings fall a lot of well collateral damage is done apparently not for secretary of state played with appropriate bluster by william hurt though i could have sworn i saw trump tower somewhere in the background so its decided that these superheroes if they are to continue being superheroes must somehow be held accountable under the authority of the united nations scarlet witch elizabeth olsen falcon anthony mackie hawkeye jeremy renner and antman paul rudd align themselves with the charismatic capn not particularly surprisingly war machine don cheadle black widow scarlett johansson vision paul bettany and in a nonspoiler spiderman tom holland a newcomer to the marvel universe it also shouldnt be a surprise that tchalla also known as black panther shows up and seemingly baffles everyone while caps longtime bff bucky sebastian stan also known as winter soldier both gives and receives ample doses of conflict if youve followed the entire series and you have then you already know that the russo brothers joe and anthony have taken over directorial duties for the epically building series and arent in fact leaving anytime soon in some ways it felt like we spent the first hour of captain america civil war helping them catch up so we could move on with things once we did move on civil war was pretty much a nonstop blast captain america civil war may be too long and too much and too at times convoluted but the marvel universe is such a relational universe and such a consistently developed universe that one almost wishes the teams behind hunger games and the increasingly awful divergent films would have taken a graduate level course in marvelology i made that up as a way of figuring out how to effectively develop multiple threads that actually mean something and actually go somewhere somehow despite nearly impossible odds captain america civil war is both convoluted yet in the end makes perfect sense robert downey jr who seems to have bounced out of his master thespian phase and fullon into his i cant believe they pay me this much effin money phase manages to dish up a nicely shaded and more emotionally complex starkiron man than weve seen yet in these films similarly chris evans adds layers of emotional honesty and spark to cap that help to give captain america civil war an emotional resonance that sits comfortably alongside all those hightech action sequences chadwick boseman is a welcome newcomer as tchallablack panther proving once again that boseman is one of hollywoods best of the upandcoming actors tom holland steals just about every scene hes in as peter parkerspiderman both boseman and holland have upcoming standalone films  i cant wait captain america civil war isnt a flawless film though im guessing most diehard fans will be more in awe of it than newcomers to the marvel universe as a nonfanboy i was completely geeked out by hollands spiderman but i had little trouble both enjoying the film immensely and recognizing the errors of its ways despite some modest reservations theres little denying that theres much to enjoy here in a film that does right just about everything that batman v superman did wrong though i happen to be one of the few film journalists who also gave batman v superman a modest thumbs up intelligent insightful consistent and the perfect balance of actionpacked meets emotionally meaningful captain america civil war sets everything up and makes sure that we absolutely fall for it
Jul 17 2020,positive, with the marvel cinematic universe showing no signs of slowing down captain america civil war is the latest addition to the franchise  the question is  is it any good i still hold a strong belief that the winter soldier remains the best marvel film because it was selfcontained standing on its own merits without feeling like a set up for another film  but i guess thats just the nature of the marvel cinematic universe now  the more they expand along with the characters they introduce or reintroduce every film will feel that weight of expectation and tease civil war suffers in that respect  the longer the film went on it went from being a captain america film to avengers 21  its not necessarily a bad thing just an observation ive seen a few reviews online and it seems customary to slyly dig at batman v superman  well sorry to disappoint you but this review wont head that way which i will explain why the argument is pointless  civil war was always going to be head and shoulders better than batman v superman and thats down to two factors  one  marvels experience given how this is their thirteenth film since 2008 in comparison to dcs two  two  whilst its not perfect and can lead to inconsistencies and formulaic structures the familiarity and build up of the characters means that each film serves as an insight  this combination ultimately and positively pays off in civil war but ironically which some may overlook batman v superman and civil war tackle the exact same theme and plot points based on accountability  its just that civil war executes the ideology better if you want an accurate and real measurable comparison for civil war then batman v superman is not the answer  you need to compare this film to avengers age of ultron  as mentioned before civil war is essentially an avengers movie but also a better executed version of age of ultron  the more i think about it with exception of the introduction of vision paul bettany and scarlett witch elizabeth olsen age of ultron doesnt hold up well essentially becoming nothing more than just a filler building off the success of the winter soldier the russo brothers deliver a marvel film with an actual consequence to the avengers actions  given the history between steve rogerscaptain america chris evans and tony starkiron man robert downey jr there is an emotional payoff adding to the choices they made in becoming avengers in the first place so what makes civil war stand out especially in comparison to age of ultron  civil war is marvels attempt to make a tonally darker yet serious film that mirrors real world politics about accountability and responsibility  with exception of a few moments theres not many jokes or quips keeping it to a minimum  the jokes were a constant issue and distraction in age of ultron  following in the same direction as the winter solider civil war continues to explore the morality of war in a grounded fashion  in other words dont expect thor or hulk to show up the division in the avengers comes in the form of the sokovia accord a change from the superhero registration act in the comics a document backed by the un and issued by secretary of state thaddeus ross william hurt the avengers must be kept in check bounded by limitations to reduce the damage and danger to innocent people  the first half of the film is a trip down memory lane guilt trip for the team followed by each member of the avengers weighing up their choices in signing the agreement or not for tony stark and steve rogers their choices are impacted by personal experiences  tonys relationship with pepper is on the rocks and despite trying to do good when hes confronted by a woman who lost her son in sokovia his decision to sign is a nobrainer and tries desperately to get the rest of the team to follow suit  for steve his choice not to sign comes from his belief to help people and when bureaucracy threatens to take away that freedom the ability to do that job comes into question  when the winter soldier bucky barnes sebastian stan is blamed for a terror attack steve finds more justification in his reasons not to support the sokovia accord the clever thing about civil war is that it never lectures you on which side is right  it presents both sides of the argument leaving the audience with the ultimate decision  but with every decision there is a cost and that can take in the shape of buckys mental torture as he tries to reconcile with his previous life and actions or thaddeus ross locking the avengers up for their criminal activities keeping them safe from the world in the villain department i still feel marvel lacks a character that really tests the avengers  whilst not perfect zemo daniel brühl does feel like an impactful upgrade in what weve seen in the past and wished the film delved more into his background instead of coming off as a simple plot device  zemo essentially does the same thing ultron tried to do but actually accomplishes it by driving a real emotional division in the avengers by fighting each other something that age of ultron lacked in terms of payoff in essence civil war doesnt have a villain  its more about the choices that captain america and iron man make  when the battle lines are drawn the team recruitment begins and thus becomes an avengers film besides the brilliance of chris evans and robert downey jr who seamlessly fulfil their roles the real standouts from civil war belong to black panther chadwick boseman and spiderman tom holland black panther  hell yes  its great to see this character given the big screen treatment but most importantly his appearance in civil war is more than just a cameo  his reasons for the fight go beyond the which side are you on argument  hes not interested in their internal battle  his motives are all about justice and he stands on his own providing another dynamic to the story spiderman on the otherhand is a cameo but a very enjoyable one  instead of an origin story we get hints to the back story based on his interaction with tony stark who recruits him  the gripes about the previous spiderman films start to fade away  peter parker is not the loser down on his luck nerd like toby maguire was or the cocky emo kid that andrew garfield played which annoyed me  this iteration showcases peter parker as the awkward yet smart nerd  when he shows up as spiderman the quips are not over the top or forced  he reacts like a normal teenager would if you were surrounded by other superheroes  from the brief glimpses theres a better balance for the character which im happy about civil war is also blessed with other character appearances such as black widow scarlett johansson falcon anthony mackie hawkeye jeremy renner war machine don cheadle vision scarlett witch and antman paul rudd  the good thing about the film is that everybody gets their moment  its not an appearance for appearance sake and the film makes a real effort to showcase their opinion on where they stand on the sokovia accord  the downside of that is it adds to the runtime  it was not to say that i was bored but because it veers off to other characters to establish them the attention is taken away from captain america  in a way civil war suffers the same problem with age of ultron  with so many characters onscreen the film can start to feel a bit overcrowded the action scenes are another positive highlight from civil war  at times it can be breathless but with the tight cuts in the editing between punches the other downside is that you dont really get to see the action as the film mostly utilises the shaky cam approach from the bourne films  plus the fights do go on for a while and theres only so much punching and kicking before it starts to feel slightly repetitive to end this review on a positive note captain america civil war is a good film and truly believe that the marvel cinematic universe is in good hands with the russo brothers  in both winter soldier and civil war their expert handling of the characters keeps you interested and most importantly caring about their actions  whilst captain america and iron mans future was concluded in an openended fashion it will be interesting to see where their relationship will evolve to next by the time infinity wars comes around civil war is a much more meaningful film and maybe in hindsight they could have gone from guardians of the galaxy and antman and skipped straight into civil war agreed in full winter soldier remains the one to beat but civil war gives it a run for its money the casting is uniformly great black panther was a great addition and black widow not having her own movie at this point seems dumber by the minute also appreciated downey jr here  dialing back the motormouth lets him stretch his acting muscle a bit making stark less cocky and more approachable thanks for the comment  yes at this point it feels very silly that black widow doesnt have her own movie  shes been more than integral to captain america and the avengers films than hawkeye for example and civil war is another case in the argument  even if its a miniseries on netflix her character deserves somethingand some action figures in the toy section agreed on downey jr as well   brilliant performance and we get a different version of stark  hes definitely a character who has gone through the motions since he became iron man and its great to see that explored again in the film  the only nitpick i would have is tony was so convinced in his justification to sign the accord because of what happened in sokovia and the young boythen halfway through the film hes recruiting a teenage version of peter parker to join the fight  felt a bit like double standards someone over at av club commented that it was starks ptsd starting to show and pointed out that the other characters called him out on bring peter along too it seemed a plausible argument maybe theyre setting something up for the next movie or maybe it was just a result of hey we have to get peter parker into this thing  bringing spiderman along does feel like a bit of a setup for his eventual movie but yeah i did think it was weird to see tony switch from being guilty then recruiting peter and then halfway through the fight hes telling peter to go home  it was like risking his life for nothing unlike black panther who had genuine reasons for fighting  i enjoyed reading your post i really like how marvel introduces new superheroes that i know little or nothing about and makes me excited for them vision and black panther are great examples of that of course guardians of the galaxy are another i literally got chills when seeing black panther in full costume and i loved that chase sequence thanks  black panther was brilliant  really cant wait until his solo movie comes out  i think it will be a game changer  as mentioned in my review i just love he didnt side with either avenger  he did his own thing and that was refreshing to watch in seeing a character operate within their own means instead of the usual good vs bad mantra i thought black panther would join in the fight at the end but i like how he didnt because it showed he didnt side with any one avenger hes on his own path i thought they handled that well yeah they handled that aspect of his character very well  i still dont think this is marvels best movie but it was certainly entertaining for what it was worth
Jul 9 2020,positive,civil war as a whole was a well done accumulation of previous themes and atonement for the events that occurred in previous marvel installments
Jul 3 2020,positive,this is the peak of marvels long form storytelling approach thus fara jumping off point for things to come
Jun 29 2020,positive, phase 3 has officially begun with the arrival of captain america civil war the new set of marvel cinematic universe movies officially starts not only will we be treated to sequels to the fantastic guardians and antman but we will be introduced and reintroduced to several characters new to the mcu such as one of my alltime personal favorites doctor strange this is also set to be the longest phase so far and civil war kicks things off on a high note when an avengers mission accidentally causes the deaths of some innocent bystanders from the african country of wakanda the united nations looks over all of the collateral damage the team has caused around the world especially in new york and sokovia the climactic battles in the avengers films the un comes up with the sokovia accords which will effectively place the avengers under the uns jurisdiction where they will decide when and where to send the teamtony stark robert downey jr is in favor of the accords feeling responsible for creating ultron and all of the destruction that wrought captain america chris evans has more confidence in the teams own abilities to regulate themselves and feels the un might keep them from helping people based upon political agendas this creates a divide within the avengers with some siding with tony and some with capmeanwhile a mysterious figure named zemo daniel bruhl is manipulating events in order to cast a negative public view on the avengers as a whole some of this plan involves framing and eventually controlling the winter soldier sebastian stan caps old friend bucky who you remember was turned into an assassination weapon for the soviet union during the cold war so while the sokovia accords provides the wedge between tony and cap its the question of buckys innocence that becomes the hammer used to drive said wedge into placecaptain america civil war is essentially avengers 25 and its all the better for that it also makes sense over the course of his own two films and the two avengers cap has become the teams leader so you almost cant tell a story starring him without involving a good number of the other heroes i have a feeling this may be a trend for a lot of the character sequels going forward toospeaking of the characters we get both an introduction and a reintroduction in this film first we are introduced to the black panther chadwick boseman jackie robinson in 42 he is the prince of wakanda and hes out for vengeance against the winter soldier which puts him on tonys side we also get thanks to marvel studios reacquisition of rights a reintroduction to spiderman relative newcomer tom holland hes also on tonys side and his introduction in the film is one of the best scenesspeaking of best scenes what youre really waiting for is the big central fight sequence where all of the heroes faceoff in a giant in more ways than one melee its exciting edgeofyourseat battle that is quite often very funny when you have iron mans snarky or should i say starky humor mixed with antmans goofiness and pitchperfect oneliners from spidey you cant help but laugh while your heart is racing at the same timethe film is also unexpectedly emotional with the question of friendships and loyalties on the line the plot does a good job of showing how these tensions honestly affect the characters deep down they have been friends and teammates for a long time seen and been through a lot of terrible things they dont want to be on opposing sides but they all feel they have no choice in the side they choose also we get closure for some storylines and none of the heroes arrive at the other end of things unscathed in some way or anothercivil war is incredible moves along quickly through its 2andahalfhour runtime and cements the fact that marvel is doing things right and whatever dc is attempting with their movies is only a pale imitation id like to get into the comparison of the 2 comic movie universes but i dont think the internet has enough room for a treatise that massiveon a side notethis week you may have heard a lot about an app called list developed by bj novak from the office im not usually one to jump on the

suggestions for lists of any kind send me the idea and ill try to come up with something it doesnt have to even be favorites i also have many dislikes and a few outright hates when it comes to filmsi also dont just love movies im a huge reader and i love music too so maybe combine them book adaptations film soundtracks songs or scores whatever youd like to know my opinions on ill try to come up with a list and lets make it hard for me and keep it to a top 5 because i can easily make a top 100 if given the chance but no one wants me to ramble that muchin honor of friday the 13th one of my

May 1 2020,negative,i dont have time for this plotline anymore
May 1 2020,negative,its fatiguing
Feb 13 2020,positive, with a few exceptions nobody sets out to make a bad movie whether the filmmakers are confident or delusional they start out with good intentions but heres where it gets tricky in order to make a good movie you need a compelling story interesting characters and a way to bring the two together organically sounds easy right it gets even harder when we move into the world of blockbuster filmmaking you have to factor in massive budgets the desire of nervous executives stifling risk in order to maximize profits and inexperienced directors getting swallowed up by their project these are all reasons why when the summer movie season starts many of us prepare ourselves for the onslaught of loud and stupid yet miracles happen blockbusters are released that not only have spectacle but also intelligence and wit given how dysfunctional and cowardly the modern studio system is its astounding that every year populist entertainment of quality is released im talking about movies like the dark knight or mad max fury road or the bourne ultimatum that trend continues with captain america civil war and it makes good on the promise of 2008s iron man picking up after the events of last years avengers age of ultron were reintroduced to a team of avengers on a mission captain america chris evans is the teams leader and hes joined by the black widow scarlett johansson falcon anthony mackie and the scarlet witch elizabeth olsen the villain crossbones frank grillo still a little testy after having had a building dropped on him in captain america the winter soldier has targeted an infectious disease lab to steal a bioweapon and the avengers aim to stop him but things go south and an explosion rips a hole in a skyscraper causing civilian casualties for the world this is the last straw theyve put up with an alien invasion in midtown manhattan helicarriers exploding over the skies of washington dc and a psychotic robot laying waste to the european nation of sokovia it seems that every time the avengers save the world they reduce a goodsized chunk of it to smoking rubble thats why 117 member nations of the un pass the sokovia accords it directs that instead of being a private paramilitary group the avengers will now be a task force with un oversight sounds like a good idea right iron man robert downey jr certainly thinks so enhanced individuals like the avengers need to be accountable to the world for their actions cap doesnt like it what if the team needs to intervene in a conflict but politics prevent them from doing so theyre both right and this sets up conflict between earths mightiest heroes things get worse when a bomb detonates in a terrorist attack and caps bff the winter soldier sebastian stan is implicated a victim of decades of brainwashing hes a walking killing machine who has rediscovered his conscience and the un directs the avengers to hunt him down cap sets out to prove his innocence kicking off a series of escalating skirmishes between factions of heroes throw into the mix the warriorking black panther chadwick boseman who has his own bone to pick with the winter soldier as well as your friendly neighborhood spiderman tom holland theres also the mysterious zemo daniel bruhl whos murdering former hydra operatives and has his own shadowy connection for anyone other than an unrepentant nerd like me this movie shouldnt work it has a running time of nearly twoandahalf hours numerous subplots and over a dozen heroes punching blasting shrinking magicking and thwipping its directed by the guys who made you me and dupree on paper this is again a thing that rhymes with clusterduck but look a little closer and youll see why civil war works so well joe and anthony russo the directors of the aforementioned clusterduck also were heavily involved with the beloved tv comedy community they learned how to effectively balance a large ensemble cast how to portray emotion through action and how to cleanly shoot an action scene with creativity as a result theyve made a film chock full of propulsive plotting and kickass fight scenes more importantly the know when to slow down for character beats to let the film breathe some of the best moments are between characters who care deeply about each other arguing christopher markus and stephen mcfeely have been part of the marvel cinematic universe since they wrote 2011s captain america the first avenger as much as i dig joss whedon and the excellent work he did on the previous avengers movies markus and mcfeely are a big reason why the captain america movies are really the crown jewels in the crown of the mcu whedon occasionally has a nasty habit of having his characters sound the same but markus and mcfeely go to great pains to make sure that every character even those with minimal screen time have their own unique voice they know that one of the aspects making the conflict so compelling is that we like the characters on both sides plus as much as the movie might seem like avengers 25 this is at heart captain americas story and they never forget it it also helps that the supporting players are bringing their a game im pretty confident that most peoples favorite character will be teenage wiseass spiderman tom hollands peter parker is a good kid but hes also an inexperienced ball of enthusiasm who gets by through equal parts luck and skill as the black panther chadwick boseman is an intriguing mix of soulfulness and nobility even folks with limited time like jeremy renners imtoooldforthissuperheroing marksman hawkeye scarlett johanssons shadowy pragmatist black widow or paul rudds gushing fanboy antman make indelible impacts nobody gets left behind robert downey jr has played tony stark six times now and this is easily his best portrayal of the billionaire playboy philanthropist hes raw going through trauma guilt and anger the trademark snark downey has brought to the character of iron man isnt the default emotion but its a defense mechanism and you can track how hes grown and changed since the first iron man film downey is one of the worlds biggest movie stars but people sometimes forget that hes an excellent actor and that skill is on display here for years people pointed to christopher reeves portrayal of superman as the platonic ideal of a superhero performance as the good captain chris evans is right up there with him equal in every way hes the beating heart of the mcu a guy who does the right thing not out of revenge or loss but because its the right thing to do it would be easy to make cap a hopeless square and a guy whos always right but maybe he lets his friendship with the winter soldier blind him maybe hes escalating the situation out of selfishness cap has also changed since his first appearance and seeing evans guide him into morally murky waters is terrific so rejoice since we live in an age of marvels captain america civil war is muscular filmmaking but never at the expense of character or ideas every time you think its going to become overstuffed it provides you with a joke or a sincere moment or a thoughtful point of view is it the best film in the mcu im not sure yet i need to see how it speaks to me over time but if its not the best its pretty high up there
Jan 22 2020,positive,in the end captain america civil war is an entertaining film while dealing with complex human emotions
Jan 14 2020,positive,  the emotional stakes are high in captain america civil war a film that ditches overt threats to humanity for a conflict borne from the characters beliefs and their love for the people who matter to them the most  with batman v superman dawn of justice behind us and xmen apocalypse looming some moviegoers might wonder why this year our superheroes cant all get along civil war shows why this is a movie about actions and consequences perception and reality regret over roads not taken and guilt over the ones that were loss and acceptance and change its a film where characters are haunted by relationships in their pasts that affect the present grief is here too but whenever anger drives these people no one can think clearly  directors anthony russo and joe russo who helmed 2014s captain america the winter soldier and screenwriters christopher markus and stephen mcfeely who wrote that film as well as 2011s captain america the first avenger know these characters well there are setups from the earlier filmsthe most significant being the childhood friendship between steve rogerscaptain america chris evans and bucky barnes sebastian stanthat pay off here in both poignancy and motivation caps shield might defy the laws of physics but the characters behave in ways that track not only with other marvel films but in a way that makes sense within the film the script draws on characters histories as far back as 2008s iron man to show how and why theyve arrived at where they are today yet even with a full slate of charactersand a running time of 147 minutesit never feels overstuffed or slow  when an avengers mission to recover a biological agent results in civilian casualties secretary of state thaddeus ross william hurt says the worlds nations are tired of the heroes collateral damage the proposed solution the sokovia accords named after the fictional country blasted to the sky in 2015s avengers age of ultron which would regulate when and how the team operates  when they met in 2012s the avengers cap and tony starkiron man robert downey jr initially dismissed each other as an antiquated fossil and a loudmouth in a hightech suit a world war ii super soldier living in the modern age cap finds purpose in protecting others as he struggles with melancholy because most of his peers are gone technological genius tony tended to shoot or create first then ask questions later  though they earned each others respect experiences since then have changed them tony already feeling guilt over creating the malevolent artificial intelligence ultron is doubly ready to reign in his independence once a grieving mother confronts him about her sons death in sokovia but cap having learned in the winter soldier that the government agency shield was poisoned from within is skeptical of any authority beyond the people he trusts  once the philosophical lines are drawn a new villain daniel brühl of inglourious basterds stirs the pot ultimately forcing the heroes to decide where their loyalties lie barneshimself reprogrammed through the ages as an assassin a la jason bourneis blamed for more mayhem sending cap and falcon anthony mackie off the grid to find him on their trail is black panther chadwick boseman an african warrior king with a vendetta against barnes meanwhile tony black widow scarlett johansson and the others scramble to figure out how to help within their new restrictions  similar to the winter soldier civil war balances the clash of ideas with action sequences that are enjoyably fastpaced and easy to follow we know whos against whom and whos doing what making it even more thrilling when tanker trunks and repulsor blasts fly the film is full of solid performances especially stan as the troubled killer whos not sure hes worth his friends support boseman get on up 42 a mix of coiled rage and dignity as the first black superhero in mainstream american comics and tom holland the impossible a delight of teen awkwardness and geeky charm as spiderman spidey and paul rudd as antman pack gleeful surprises as two fanboys who hold their own even as theyre overjoyed to be tapped as reinforcements  there are callbacks to the other captain america films such as when tony asks peter parker what drives him much like the way the scientist behind the supersoldier program wondered what made a gangly steve rogers tick its no spoiler that in both cases these heroes have unselfish hearts  heart is all over this movie these characters care about one another like a family even when they disagree and when they come to blows theres a layer of trying to stop the people you love from hurting themselves or making a situation worse  evans sometimes gets short shrift for not having downeys firecracker charisma but hes always had the trickier task of making an inherently goodhearted character compelling here he shows how cap continues to evolve while retaining his sincerity and decency making the starspangled man perhaps the most hopeful comics character onscreen right now especially given the dc film universes darker tone with superman
Jan 14 2020,positive,captain america civil war is a fun time at the movies and among the best of its breed but you can be excused if you feel superhero fatigue setting in
Dec 15 2019,positive, welcome to road to endgame where we revisit the first 22 movies of the marvel cinematic universe and ask how did we get here in this edition captain america civil war pays off years of buildup by injecting politics with personal impulsethe marvel cinematic universe tries to reinvent itself every few years albeit within a limited narrative formula from scrappy real world solo films to fun landscapeshifting crossovers to alien family dramas the series has been laying track for its twopart finale  avengers infinity war and the upcoming avengers endgame  for quite some timea decade of narrative investment in the superhero genre especially in a series that aims to be so political cant be achieved without a feeling of loss last year after having been scattered by the events of captain america civil war the avengers were finally defeatedwhile no avengers lose their lives in captain america civil war the team tears itself apart from within they may as well have lost their identity the series longterm personal and political narratives finally boil over clashing with one another for reasons both idealistic and petty opposing impulses that are rightly framed as a continuum its a harrowing watch at times despite building on its predecessors confused politics debates about military intervention rage on in the real world and as of avengers age of ultron the avengers legacy finally began to stand in for americas that legacy is complicated and civil war finally grants the series an element it had been missing for nearly a decade deeply personal drive behind political ideology in civil war captain americas chris evans journey away from blind nationalism comes full circle though it leads him to an unsettling place now a selfappointed interventionist he represents american militarism once more its a fine line for a narrative to walk one the film acknowledges by positioning its wellmeaning destructive protagonist at odds with his equally wellmeaningyetdestructive teammates none of them are particularly wrong and for once a marvel film being unable to draw a singular conclusion about military power feels textually justifiedafter a botched mission resulting in civilian causalities the avengers are put on notice by a returning general thaddeus thunderbolt ross william hurt now the us secretary of state ross who was last seen in the incredible hulk is all too familiar with the dangers of unchecked power he hands the avengers the sokovia accords an agreement signed by 117 countries that would place steve rogers and his team under un supervisionthe accords makes sense at least in theory a usbased private military outfit has no business running unchecked missions on foreign soil especially when theyre half the reason these villains crop up in the first place like several other films in the series civil war differentiates between the american government and a fictional group meant to stand in for its faults however it articulates the retaliatory element of geopolitical conflict thats often ignored in western cinema especially in the marvel seriesmilitaryfunded marvel movies like iron man iron man 2 captain america the winter soldier and captain marvel were each made from scripts approved by the us department of defense in the first three of these films global military conflict was framed either a status quo for american forces to respond to or as flames stoked by outside actors for selfish motives rather than something america had a hand in in civil war however the first villain the avengers face has a personal grudge against captain america from the perspective of brock rumlow a suicide bomber steve rogers is the reason hes scarred and exists without a country later in the film primary villain helmut zemo daniel brühl is revealed to have a similar vendetta against the avengers zemos family was collateral damage to the avengers reckless interventionismcaptain america isnt keen on being supervised not out of some vaguely jingoistic notion of freedom but because hes seen the american agenda change over time both in the avengers and in captain america the winter soldier this leaves him in an interesting position he is at once opposed to the us governments idea of militarism as well as its very embodiment ready to go to war at a moments noticerogers opposes the corruption and duplicitousness that often drive foreign intervention while still adhering to its core methodology in prior films steve rogers was never given a clear ideological enemy and so his own outlook was never allowed to grow beyond the broad strokes of power here as if to finally coursecorrect this omission the series uses his divestment from ideology as a dramatic question who does captain america truly fight for if not interests he and he alone deems worthy like steve rogers tony stark robert downey jr a former arms supplier comes back around to embodying an element of the us military apparatus but where rogers represents interventionism stark now represents the government control to which he himself was once so thoroughly opposedtime and time again stark has seen his technology misused in his previous appearance avengers age of ultron he created an antagonistic ai that nearly destroyed the world ultron was defeated but not everyone got out of sokovia alive when confronted with the death of one such individual  charles spencer a young american on a mission to build affordable housing  starks guilt finally forces his handno more private militarization no more unilateral intervention the avengers need oversight  but under whose authority should they be placed the group wouldnt be needed in an ideal world the kind of world that has been starks objective since age of ultron but the old world of war and misery is one he helped create in the first placefor steve rogers doing the right thing means refusing to compromise on his moral outlook for tony stark doing the right thing means correcting his mistakes the overlap between these objectives is where the films conflict is born both men were reminded of their missions by their dying mentors  abraham erskine in captain america the first avenger ho yinsen in iron man  and those missions which now form the core of who they are have finally collidedrogers once loyal to the structures of western government has been forced to turn against the very idea of structured power stark once a man obsessed with his own unchecked might now believes its time for governments to take charge not only have rogers and stark seen the folly of their ways  having faced the most dangerous parts of blind loyalty and deregulation respectively  they now see the worst parts of their own past decisions within one another per the words of the late peggy carter hayley atwell steve rogers must remain an uncompromising protector and respond to those telling him to move with a resounding no you move a line taken straight from the civil war comics when black panther chadwick boseman tells rogers to move in germany he refuses when iron man tells him to move in siberia he refuses once morein either case rogers is protecting his best friend bucky barnes sebastian stan whose crimes both recent and in the past may not be his own rogers uncompromising loyalty to barnes however is a character flaw that functions the same way blind nationalism would captain america may no longer serve the stars and stripes but hes shackled by the same emotional instinctsrogers knows that people need to be protected and he refuses to wait for their safety to be debated by committee this is his overarching political outlook as it pertains to the accords but its rooted entirely in personal bias he took similar unilateral action to save barnes during world war ii and he carries this lesson forward in a more complicated world he doesnt fully understand he could be right about circumventing approval to save lives but he may be right for all the wrong reasonsfor tony stark a man trapped by traumas and past mistakes the guilt of his actions has become too much to bear no matter how many times relives the past through virtual reality  like his final conversation with his parents  hes unable to change it the only results of his obsession are a broken relationship and an electromagnetic headache that he nurses with pills when confronted by the mother of charles spencer who blames him for her sons death he has no choice but to try and fix the future though his reasons arent so forwardthinkingthe accords arent just a political document for stark theyre a means for him to prevent more damage to his soul not long ago stark was americas military industrial complex now hes a protector unable to move past his own destructiongetting the avengers to sign the agreement may not prevent future tragedy  as rogers rightly asks what if the avengers arent where they need to be or intervene somewhere they shouldnt   but its a step that shifts the responsibility away from stark and his team its selfish but its exactly what stark needs though hes unprepared to admit it wanda maximoffs elizabeth olsen civilian casualties in the name of protection would have been equally tragic if the mission were approved by a governing body but at least stark would have a clear consciencewhere steve rogers political outlook is rooted in attachment to the past tony starks is grounded in his desire to detach himself from it when steve rogers is close to signing the accords hes forced out of his decision by factors that feel like personal affronts whether tony stark imprisoning wanda at the avengers compound or military forces going after his wrongly accused friend bucky barnes rogers knows barnes to be innocent both for prior crimes in which he was denied autonomy and for the recent un bombing that killed wakandas king signing the accords at first could result in rogers being sidelined and in lethal military force being used on barnes insteadif rogers waits to be taken in or if he waits for a committee to decide on whether to intervene in zemos apparent plan the reawakening of more winter soldiers the world could be at risk if stark doesnt stop rogers from his reckless mission the unstable malleable barnes could cause further harm and the avengers could be shut down for goodthis rift is why the massive airport fight ensues between those loyal to captain america  barnes wanda the falcon anthony mackie hawkeye clint barton and antman paul rudd  and those who have fallen in line with iron man and the accords  black panther war machine don cheadle the vision paul bettany black widow scarlett johansson and spiderman tom holland both parties are right in that theyre justified from their own perspectives which makes the ideological conflict between the two factions engaging additionally captain america is the films protagonist and so we the audience have the same information he does about zemos plan  information iron mans team does notthis lapse in information adds stakes to the narrative over and above the enjoyable cognitive dissonance of good guys squaring off however the setpiece itself while a fun reprieve from the conflict and some of marvels most enjoyable action since the avengers remains disconnected from the rest of the film lighthearted though it may be it feels halfhearted too its laden with marvels signature quips and riproaring action beats but dramatizing interpersonal conflict through action might have been a more suitable choice the avengers fight but nobody really seems in danger  hawkeye and black widow even joke about pulling their punches  which works in opposition to the films own premise about the consequences of these battlesthe scene does eventually shift toward a more serious tone while setting up the climax  an untrained vision accidentally injures war machine thus solidifying starks position  but the scene lacks any real emotional punch until that point the airport sequence fun as it may be is at odds with what follows its immensely rewatchable on its own but incontext its lacking  the films ensuing rugpull reveals that both sides were factually wrong in effect they arent fighting for the people anymore theyre just fighting as they were in the civil war comics though their battle on the page carries far more weight than their battle onscreen the futility of their violence in the film is overshadowed by the fact that it feels like an enjoyable field tripthankfully the film proceeds to foreground its emotional heft in the scenes that follow as the story is reframed in a manner that makes the next battle between heroes  iron man and captain america  feel appropriately harrowing by shifting its major setpiece to the middle of the film civil war also sidesteps a climax steeped in marvels signature previsualized action the kind often divorced from story instead the film narrows its spotlight to focus on a tale of deeply personal conflict helmut zemos mission is complicated it depends on dozens of moving parts and on the avengers making precisely predicted decisions zemo claims to have studied the avengers closely so his place in the narrative is as much a scorned antagonist as it is an invisible metatextual hand your mileage may vary his scheme feels improbable in the realworld but guiding the avengers to these specific outcomes feels less like plot contrivance and more like catalyzing that which was already narratively inevitableevery decision zemo orchestrates is rooted character set up not only during captain america civil war but across multiple films he convinces tony stark with his newfound sense of authority to believe hes the only one who can stop a dangerous fugitive he also makes steve rogers believe his friend bucky barnes the very mention of whom blinds rogers decisionmaking is in grave danger he makes captain americas side of antiestablishment gungho freedom fighters

magnifies and accelerates what was already under the surface bringing the avengers to conclusions that feel like logical outcomes of who they arebut barnes is not the real terrorist and zemo has no

Dec 3 2019,positive, the marvel war party presses on overrunning the multiplexes this spring with captain america civil war a movie so stuffed to the gills with characters that naming it after steve rogers alterego is a bit of a misnomer rather than unifying to fight against a common enemy the avengers are fractured one faction led by captain america chris evans doesnt want to answer to the government while the other headed by iron man robert downey jr feels responsible for the bystanders who have died during past battles it doesnt really make too much sense and the sides feel randomly drawn but at least we get some really cool fight sequences when all our heroes have a go at one another clashes featuring superheroonsuperhero action have long been a staple of the avenger wing of the mcu films the first avengers movie felt more like a capcom video game than an actual film of substance this is why captain america winter soldier stands as one of the better films in the mcu instead of figuring out innovative ways for thor to battle the hulk directors anthony and joe russo crafted an action movie dedicated to just one character and the moral quandaries that come with protecting a friend who has clearly done wrong the russo brothers are back in the director seats again but civil war feels much more akin to age of ultron in its multifarious characters plots and locales than the focused narrative of winter soldier ive always taken issue with the scenes of mass destruction that rip through comic book films usually at the climax so many landmarks and buildings have been destroyed yet we never feel the human cost that comes with so much devastation in civil war screenwriters christopher markus and stephen mcfeely predicate their story on the innocents who become collateral damage when superheroes and villains fight when the us government mandates that the avengers adhere to the united nations captain america worries that kowtowing to bureaucrats will destroy the avengers tony stark however wracked with sadness after more civilians are killed in a botched operation in lagos wants to work with the un enter captain americas old friend bucky sebastian stan the winter soldier who has been brainwashed by the russians to do horrible things with his loyalty torn between the avengers and bucky rogers chooses to go rogue in an effort to clear his friends name tensions escalate and then its allout war as a litany of marvel heroes show up to fight one another for some reason we dont get thor or the hulk yet antman paul rudd and the new spiderman tom holland join the melee at least new hero black panther chadwick boseman is here for a reason and hollands spirited performance gives us something to look forward to next summer when marvel reboots the web slingers franchise yet again though civil war teases a climactic battle with five fearsome new villains markus and mcfeely never follow through with this new threat instead the climax comes when rogers and bucky must battle an enraged iron man the russos definitely know how to stage an action scene yet the final showdown is a bit of a letdown especially when the hintedat melee against these five new villains never materializes but who cares right we want to see folks like the scarlet witch elizabeth olsen black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner go at it rather than some nameless baddies it all comes back to that climactic fight where the avengers try to kill one another at an airport its a noholdsbarred throwdown where each character gets to flaunt his or her superpower yet like everything in these comic book movies there is absolutely nothing at stake even when one character plummets to the ground you know he isnt toast there are too many different franchises involved to kill anyone off and even if they did how many movies would it take for them to be resurrected early water doesnt have much of an arc  after all its a rehearsal tape but it does have a surprisingly plentiful array of textures and transitions within its somewhat narrow parameters 
Nov 19 2019,positive, on the heels of avengers age of ultron the marvel heroes are left frowned upon by much of the world after all it was tony starks fault that ultron was created in the first place now back in the united states captain america finds himself being governed into not being a hero at will his biggest objection to this comes from the need to help his best friend bucky barnes after he is accused of a horrible crime stark on the other hand feels the weight of his actions in sokovia on very intimate levels and sides with the government at no point during captain america civil war does one character seem more right than the other and its a remarkable achievement everything the filmmakers and cast members said about audiences being truly divided turns out to be true captain america is not only fighting for something he believes in but what he believes in is credible and organic to the films story the same can be said for iron man when the fights begin the action is second to none despite being thirteen movies in marvels team found ways to innovate the action packed scenes by capitalizing on each characters abilities and chemistry with one another for impressively creative sequences the team has worked together for a while now both in an onscreen and behindthescenes capacity and it is clearly conveyed on the big screen speaking of the team having almost the entire ensemble cast of heroes together minus hulk and thor is something to be admired the russo brothers had previously directed the acclaimed winter soldier edition of the captain america trilogy but that effort was much less dense this time around they were burdened with bringing in over a dozen already established characters while also introducing two new major heroes each character though is given their own arc none are forgotten or overlooked while some are larger than others it is equally delightful to see scarlet witch and visions relationship explored as it is to see captain america break the rules in an internal struggle even though civil war packs a lot of characters into its runtime it is still very much a captain america film another filmmaker promise made good it takes the points of the first avenger and the winter soldier that were left openended and builds upon them that said the film also does a great job telling iron mans story the last time we saw iron man outside of an avengers movie he blew up his suits for his girlfriend pepper the consequences of not following through on that promise going back and continuing to make new ones are thoroughly displayed here the characters many fans are both most curious and most excited about going into civil war are the newcomers black panther and spiderman chadwick boseman steps into the tchalla role and tom holland jumps gleefully in as peter parker the two couldnt possibly be more welcome additions to the marvel cinematic universe black panthers arc is the most complete and noteworthy of the film spiderman in action is the best its ever been the two characters were handled masterfully and fit right into the mix of characters without standing in anyones shadow in fact there are times when they may put our existing avengers into shadows of their own the character who was unfortunately given the short end of the stick in civil war was daniel bruhls baron zemo while bruhl clearly poured himself into the role the villain was the least interesting part of the film as the momentum built between the heroes audiences are taken to completely different locations to see what the manipulative menace is up to only to wish they were still seeing whats going on between cap and the tin man as far as marvel villains go zemo is arguably the darkest shades of batman v supermans lex luthor can certainly be seen here the villain is cruel his methods are more brutal than typically seen in the traditional marvel studios film raising the stakes as a whole captain america civil war is the darkest marvel movie to date that doesnt mean it gets serious and gritty throughout  the one liners and boat loads of fun are still there  but it tackles issues and emotional moments like no film before it everything that worked in the winter soldier is emphasized and exploited the emotional beats never missed there are moments that will have audiences audibly gasping there are themes of friendship love heartbreak and fear which are blended seamlessly for the comic fans civil war will certainly satisfy while its far from an exact adaptation of the original marvel comics its not too far to see its roots there are beats from the pages splashed right across the silver screen and anyone thinking the movie needed more heroes to do the story justice was wrong the airport battle scene teased in the trailers could be watched on a loop for three hours and still be worth the price of admission its quite possibly the pinnacle representation of where movies and technology stand today by its end captain america civil war alters the marvel cinematic universe more than any film before the avengers are truly left shattered heading into infinity war and the audience is left begging for more while its hard to compare to the most unique film which is guardians of the galaxy captain america civil war fights its way to be the best marvel movie so far as the studio continues to find ways to outdo themselves in emotion action and character did you see captain america civil war want a chance to win a hot toys 16th scale captain america figure from the movie head on over to the

Nov 3 2019,positive, to the horror of many of my colleagues in the press and evoking a chorus of gasps and boos from them at the recent press junket for captain america civil war although paul rudd cheered and kevin feige lit up like a christmas tree i dared to say that which apparently should not be said captain america civil war is better than star wars the force awakens i said it then ive said it since and i say it again now while the force awakens is a global phenomena filled with touchstones of the past 40 years that tap into and tug at every fiber of ones being the puzzle pieces are not as integrated within the film as a whole as those in captain america civil war hands down captain america civil war is not only better than the force awakens but the best film in the marvel cinematic universe and the best film of the year thus far screenwriters christopher markus and stephen mcfeely who have been with the series since captain america the first avenger know this world and the characters intimately and take advantage of that going deeper with exploration into the psyche and emotions of each expounding on andor introducing backstories that are interwoven within the films fabric while developing situations and storylines that allow for exploration of themes that challenge the limits and boundaries of not only themselves but their individual and collective places in an everchanging world akin to the united states own civil war here we have brother against brother friend against friend as markus and mcfeely together with directors joe russo and anthony russo delve into the ideals of free will the ability to choose responsibility selfsacrifice selfsatisfaction vengeance forgiveness and redemption addressing an uncompromising code of ethics within steve rogers captain america himself there is no longer a clear cut right or wrong a maturity permeates the film and each character as we see each grow up although there are still enough smartaleck oneliners bandied about they are scaled back in number and tempered most notably within robert downey jrs iron man replaced with thoughtful questioning and selfexamination these characters the collective avengers have long gone beyond being comic book heroes there is a real sense of humanity now embedded in the onscreen fabric of reality and life as we know it with each avenger facing the same crisis of conscience and selfquestioning as each of us resulting in friction and conflict that serves as the catalyst to the brother against brother civil war character arcs are fully developed and engrossing the script is intricately and brilliantly written making us not only think but entertain us at the same time much of that entertainment factor beyond the characters themselves comes by way of action and not just action sequences for the sake of action and set pieces the action in captain america civil war is much like the song and dance sequences in mgm musicals during the arthur freed years it is a component part of the script and the story flowing with the dialogue and story for a completely cohesive and synergistic meld of story and action and yes while there is the much ballyhooed airport sequence that brings spiderman antman and black panther into the fold with civil war the russos bring us more intimate and inventive fight choreography and sequencing that not only mirrors the emotional and moral battles between brothers and sisters but which is also executed in closer quarters metaphorically intensifying how personal the fight has now become for each captain america civil war begins with a 1991 flashback to james bucky buchanan as he is released from his cryogenic state by soviet soldiers and programmed for duty as the winter soldier we witness the pain of the psychologic transformation and gain better understanding of who this mankilling machine is we see the man we feel his pain and then we see the twisted result of science fast forward to the present and we meet up with steve rogerscaptain america natasha romanoffblack widow wanda maximoffscarlet witch and sam wilsonfalcon as they attempt to capture brock rumlowcrossbones rumored to have survived his last encounter with the avengers and now involved in some of sort of terrorism in the country of lagos although successful in their intended mission things go more than awry with explosions destruction and mass civilian casualties called back to washington for a meeting with secretary of state thaddeus ross and an unusually quiet tony stark the team  including lt james rhodeswar machine and vision  is being strongarmed to agree to the sokovia accords which would place the avengers under the jurisdiction of the united nations 147 countries have signed the accords believing that the avengers need to be put in check after what happened in sokovia new york and washington dc and tony stark already facing his own crisis of conscience having lost pepper potts thanks to his obsessive and difficult nature as a boyfriend has been pushed into agreeing with the accords once racked with guilt after a confrontation with the mother of a young man killed in sokovia not surprisingly rhodes is backing stark also in agreement is vision natasha and wanda understand the reason behind the accords and will agree to them but are not jumping for joy the holdout is steve rogers he looks beyond the immediate rush to judgment and sees the totality of the circumstances the what if factor what if there is a threat that must be immediately addressed but the avengers cant act without a un resolution what if they need to jump into action but for political reasons they are precluded from so doing no steve rogers will not sign the accords rogers becomes even more resolute in his position when the meeting of the un world leaders in vienna to celebrate and sign the accords is attacked leaving hundreds dead and even more injured with all fingers pointing at bucky barneswinter soldier as the masked man who detonated the building something rogers refuses to believe he knows bucky he knows the humanity is still within him he knows bucky isnt responsible for this heinous attack so while there is an all points bulletin to capture and kill bucky rogers determines to find his friend and save him making him even more determined is the death of peggy carter and some words of wisdom in a eulogy delivered at peggys funeral by her niece sharon carter the same sharon who was watching over rogers while undercover for shield and standing by rogers side is sam wilson but its going to take more than captain america and falcon to save bucky especially once the pieces start coming together and a new villain is in the mix zemo a villain who knows the best way to bring down an empire is from within with battle lines drawn the teams start amassing  team iron man and team cap joining iron man is war machine black widow vision and newcomer black panther aka tchalla the king of wakanda who is seeking revenge against bucky for killing his father in the vienna explosion of course always on the lookout for new talent tony stark discovers a young man slinging webs and swinging across rooftops and elicits his help that young webslinger is spiderman all now deemed criminals for violating the accords team cap is led by captain america with bucky buchanan falcon scarlet witch and hawkeye who comes out of retirement and doing activities with his kids to stand by scarlet witch and cap by his side and thanks to falcon whos got a guy who knows a guy antman joins in the fracas and while team cap and team iron man are facing off zemo is putting the final touches on his plan for the ultimate destruction of the avengers theres no denying robert downey jr don cheadle chris evans anthony mackie jeremy renner and scarlett johansson know their characters inside out interesting is watching the growth of each character and the subtleties each actor brings to play notable is johanssons performance as she imbues an ambiguity within natasha that is so authentic we see conflict on her face and in hesitant tentative movements mackie easily picks up the mantle of having some of the lighter dialogue which we might normally expect from downey mackie brings more of a humorous touch as opposed to biting sarcasm which works extremely well within the story construct here however downey gives one of his finest dramatic scenes in the franchise thanks to a revelation that will blow your mind this goround we get to discover more about bucky and as a result we see more of sebastian stan and what he brings to the table stan has a brooding questioning intensity that is riveting as we like cap must always wonder which bucky are we seeing stan does a delicate dance vacillating between his personalities similarly elizabeth olsen demonstrates what a fine dramatic actress she is becoming as wanda constantly questions herself olsen plays the inquisitive selfexamination beautifully particularly opposite paul bettanys vision as we wonder just whats up with those two bettany also adds a questioning pragmatism to vision who is still learning the ropes as a new being as black panther chadwick boseman makes a more than impressive entrance into the mcu and without giving any spoilers creates more than enough interest and excitement for whats to come for black panther although weve already seen and love paul rudd as antman it doesnt take away from the joy of seeing his comedic antics and timing of dialogue delivery as he mixes it up with the avengers tossing in tongueincheek oneliners that are especially effective when expressing his childlike glee at meeting each and every one of them and speaking of childlike glee look no further than the first perfectly cast spiderman with tom holland scenestealing wideeyed eager holland is everything you hope to see in a young super hero testing the waters with his super hero gimmick watching holland and downey at their initial meeting is hilarious as you see the 17year old downey come out in full force as he taunts holland and the two go back and forth like on a playground as with rudds antman the russos and scribes markus and mcfeely also infuse spiderman with his own giddy glee at meeting the avengers again a very human touch nice to see emily vancamps sharon carter expanded here and to see vancamp embrace the performance with a freedom that is welcoming but also with nuance similar to that of johansson daniel bruhl is perfection as zemo with a baby face and performance texture that speaks anything but villain it falls to subtlety and dialogue delivery to inform the character a talent which bruhl turns on and off with ease he fascinates and be on the lookout for a very fun trip down memory lane as maria tomei reteams with her 1994 only you costar robert downey jr as spidermans aunt mae meets tony stark the action is unparalleled not only in its incorporation as part of the scripted dialogue but in its execution switching up lensing styles from intimate handheld to crane dolly widescreen we are immersed in each moment while feeling the stakes of each battle thanks to the meld of story and action as described to me by joe russo action is very important to us these movies are about action the characters express themselves through action action has to have storytelling to enforce it  youll get tired of an action sequence if its not either defining a character or moving the story forward in some way and it takes an incredible amount of effort crediting kevin feige and the writers who can work with us and keep us honest in terms of the storytelling as well as the cast who are also the caretakers of the characters in a way that we never could do melding story and action is by far and away the hardest thing to do on a film reflecting on the filmmaking process russo notes the easiest thing to do on a film is when you have a soderbergh level cast like this to put down the dramatic scenes on camera especially with actors of this caliber who have been playing these parts for this long those are some of the easiest things we do so the hardest thing we do is executing the action and as comes as no surprise for russo the toughest sequence in the film was the airport sequence its filled with a lot of moving parts a lot of different characters you want to move each character forward you want to make sure youre not leaving anybody behind i think we went well into the post process still reshaping and rethinking and reconfiguring that sequence to make sure that it had its maximum storytelling thrust to it there is a conviction of purpose that infuses every aspect of captain america civil war be it within the characters or the script or the lensing confidence in purpose abounds at every turn as sure as tony stark is in his beliefs and as certain as steve rogers is in his there is never a wavering in the investment of showing both sides of the coin and the overall package the bar has been set the battles lines drawn be it team cap or team iron man captain america civil war is better than star wars the force awakens the best of the mcu and dare i say it the best movie of the year
Oct 27 2019,positive, not only does the film juggle a dozen major superheroes pretty seamlessly but it somehow manages to tell a cohesive story while not making the film feel too stuffed or overcomplicated after a nyc screening of civil war ended monday evening the man on my right declared that this was the movie bvs director zack snyder thought he made now thats not easy for me to say i love batman and while i did not detest warner bros big budget batman v superman movie as much as most critics i couldnt shake the feeling that civil war was the movie warner bros wanted to make  the superheroes deal with the fallout of their previous big action flick man of steelavengers age of ultron after one more mishap the government gets involved to enforce superhero regulation as a result the superheroes are pit against each other for the entire movie only to learn in the third act that a madman mastermind orchestrated everything with the intention of the heroes tearing each other apart batman v superman was about playing catch up to marvels big cinematic universe in doing so a lot was thrown into the film some things worked like ben afflecks batman many others  doomsday the insertion of extraneous superheroes for future films and that random bathtub scene with a nude lois lane  didnt civil war did everything bvs tried to do in a big superhero film pretty effortlessly and while catering to a larger rotating cast of characters when you put a group of beloved superheroes on a large stage together you shouldnt just have them fighting each other for the sake of fighting as a viewer you want to see characters who dont know each other meet for the first time what would it be like if spiderman met iron man how would antman get along with hawkeye civil war answers those questions and more where bvs failed to deliver fun witty dialogue between its trinity of heroes in costume civil war succeeds tenfold paul rudds antman fanboys over meeting captain america chris evans antman messes with iron man robert downey jr and spiderman tom holland comments on the logic of captains shield falcon and bucky barnesthe winter soldier sebastian stan also have a fun lovehate relationship at one point the two are seated in a hilariously tiny beetle they look hilarious in it when bucky asks falcon if he can move his seat up without looking at him falcon adamantly says no that received the biggest laugh at my screening civil war is about more than just superheroes going to battle and its not all fun and games it becomes a question of whether superheroes should be granted unlimited freedom to act without government supervision when captain americas former best friend bucky is wanted for a crime he didnt commit he sides with him against a majority of the avengers the question for him becomes how far do you go for a friend what are you willing to risk for something that you believe in  your freedom your reputation the avengers really dont want to go to battle because the people on each of the two sides see each other as an extended family of sorts they care about each other whether theyll admit it or not thats evident when steve rogers asks tony stark about his uncertain relationship with pepper potts and when black widow and hawkeye are facing off the two friends dont try to kill one another they dont even give it their all and scarlet witch elizabeth olsen calls hawkeye out on that where the film really pays off is with its big action sequences though weve seen a majority of them teased in trailers and television spots they are some of the best of any marvel movie pretty much every review talks about the big airport scene teased in the films trailers that was handsdown the most satisfying scene of any marvel movie ive ever watched others have said this but i would watch that scene on loop several times over and it would still not be enough im not even going to say anything more about it because it should just be experienced in theaters and thats not the only large fight sequence to get excited about there are multiple superhero team ups and takedowns throughout the film for fans to enjoy including a showdown between iron man captain america and the winter soldier chadwick bosemans black panther is a commanding presence any time hes on screen as the prince of the fictional african nation of wakanda hell be getting his own standalone movie in 2018 and once again vision paul bettany is a wonderful comedic relief for whatever reason his ai wears a few sweaters in the film whoever thought to put clothes on the ai bravo its so distractingly delightful the overall scene stealer is tom hollands spiderman the film wastes no time trying to tell the webslingers backstory hes just inserted into the fray and it works after five spiderman films since 2002 if you dont know his origin story by now bitten by a radioactive spider gets spiderlike abilities then youve probably been living under a rock but unlike the previous men in the role tobey maguire andrew garfield peter parker  whos a teen when he gets his powers in the comics  is finally being played by you guessed it a teen and he refreshingly acts like a young kid with superpowers would unlike the other heroes hes overly chatty in fight sequences his rapport with downey jrs tony stark on screen is the kicker stark refers to him as spiderling and spiderboy while inquiring about his hot aunt may marisa tomei i would watch an entire movie with those two together good news well get to see them together again in a new spiderman a close second is robert downey jr if this wasnt a captain america movie it could easily be an iron man movie with starks snarky quips and one liners however beneath the billionaires haughty ego civil war reveals a vulnerable layer of emotional depth to starks character you probably werent expecting to receive in a big ensemble picture civil war isnt the best superhero movie ever or marvels best movie yet as many critics have said its up there but i think joss whedons the avengers and guardians of the galaxy are better the film starts off a bit slow wading us through the uns plan to get all of the enhanced humans to sign some paperwork approved by 117 countries to relinquish their rights as free avengers up until the hour mark youre watching tony stark chase down steve rogers trying to convince him to sign said papers thrilling stuff if youve watched the trailers youre just waiting around to see the heroes join sides with captain america or iron man once you get past the one hour mark its all actionpacked smooth sailing one of the other complaints i have about the film is the main villain while the character himself is a longstanding avengers comic villain in the film he doesnt appear to be much more than a mere mortal if youre a casual viewer you may leave the film going that guy was able to pull one over on the avengers if a superpowerless man is able to turn the avengers against themselves i fear what an alien like thanos who has been hinted since 2012s the avengers can do to the team its not looking so good  the film itself has too much location jumping as well there are over half a dozen location changes across the film which seems a bit unnecessary its not a subtle transition either thanks to the giant lettering that crowds the screen any time the film swaps venues it was rather distracting and took you out of the film for a few seconds every time civil war may not be a perfect film but its a grand illustration of what makes marvels superhero movies so successful  theyre fun relatable and easily accessible for general audiences who have never picked up a comic book as the other studios try to play catchup with marvels cinematic universe on the big screen they should take note
Oct 21 2019,positive,its hard to get all the characters involved without making it confusing but directors anthony russo and joe russo did their homework and a pretty good job
Oct 21 2019,positive, captain america civil war opens too wide release this weekend have we finally reached superhero saturation or will civil war directors the russo brothers keep audiences crazy and clamoring for more cinema siren has the answer for you let me start with not so much a warning as a tease captain america civil war is not really a captain america movie its an avengers movie standing behind a starred shield while cap is the central figure he is so only by small margin its a story comic book fans know and love and its interpretation for the screen has been much anticipated as the name implies the central storyline of civil war is that our favorite costumed characters once friends are now at odds being asked to allow oversight by the powersthatbe has lead to a rift captain america leads one side and iron man leads the other they enlist a whopping 10 other superheroes to their teams colossal clashes ensue there are battles who is on what team and why does the idea of two major comic book creations tussling while politicians cry for more control sound somewhat familiar indeed in that way captain america civil war shares more than just a passing similarity to batman v superman so what any comic book fan knows there are many shared themes and stories with that in mind why cant marvel and dc coexist and even dare i say intermingle in the hearts of fans that being said captain america civil war benefits greatly and keeps their audiences in thrall leveraging the basic marvel trait shared by most of its characters a snarky sense of humor or perhaps we should say a starky one there is no shortage of darkness death and destruction in this film but comedic touches offer welcome shifts in mood in that directors anthony and joe russo create a nearly perfect balance kudos also to the screenwriters who somehow divvy up just the right amount of screen time to heroes we know such as cap iron man and black widow those we want to know better like war machine vision scarlet witch and antman and those we meet for the first time with cheers often erupting when onscreen black panther as played by chadwick boseman and spiderman ably embodied by tom holland nearly steal the entire film and both beg for their own features there are some strong surprising character arcs especially for steve rogers which is as it should be chris evans has made the character so his own its hard to imagine any other actor donning his shield downey jr himself is quite a standout in the film we learn a great deal about starks backstory and the personal demons that plague him and as usual the actor is up to the challenge with this many characters and aspects to story its possibly inevitable that things get a bit unnecessarily convoluted especially with regards to the villains and even several of the heroes motivations these are forgivable trifles in the face of such entertainment and spectacle captain america civil war has thrown down the gauntlet for any other wouldbe blockbuster released in 2016 i pity any film regardless of genre opening in the next four weeks it would be easy to nitpick about confusing plot lines and an over abundance of characters that would mean unfairly discrediting the colossal job of successfully integrating so many superheroes while maintaining distinct personalities and points of view ultimately captain america civil war is fun  exciting and will make even more fans if thats even possible for the avengers franchise

Aug 29 2019,positive, the russo brothers joe and anthony did such a killer job on winter soldier that marvel not only gave them civil war but also gave them the nod for the next avengers infinity war  part 1  2 in the vein of batman v superman dawn of justice but a masterclass smackdown on how to do it properly captain america civil war pits superhero against superhero upping the ante tenfold by making it plural and making it the avengers more superpower more firepower but most importantly more brainpower makes this not just a far superior superhero move but a far superior movie full stop so simply put and spoilerfree here we have captain america on a mission to do the right thing by his old mate bucky except this time not everyone agrees well mostly iron man doesnt agree and tony stark is used to getting his own way while i know youre one click away from knowing each and everyone of them what they do who plays them when theyre next in their own movie and what their favourite colour is let me remind you how much more fun movies are the less you know about them as usual with the russo brothers the fight and action scenes both intimate handtohand and allin ground and air brawls are outstanding in imax 3d especially they are stunningly immersive and glorious to watch but tying all the action together is a tight cohesive superbly told story infused with comedy and heart a story which allowed each of the characters to play their part without ever overshadowing the ensemble  two viewings in there is plenty of time for civil war to take on winter soldier as my favourite marvel ever  its already a close contest
Jul 9 2019,positive, at the end of the first iron man when nick fury samuel l jackson popped up to mention the avengers initiative it launched what can only be described as the most massive collective nerdgasm in this or any quantum parallel reality since then there have been minor nerdquake aftershocks seeing the team together for the first time hearing captain america chris evans first bark out orders the insane sidescrolling action shot in age of ultron but twice during captain america civil war i thought the audience was going to have the first recorded joyous nerdshart well get to them just wait for it unlike batman v superman i told you that was going to suck which was allegedly a sequel to man of steel but was really two hours of hilariously overwrought dude brooding civil war is honestly a sequel to captain america winter soldier hell it harkens all the way back to the first solo captain america movie in a meaningful way cap is looking for the winter soldier sebastian stan who everyone sees as a terrorist menace who needs to be put down except cap who wants his friend back this leads into a bigger divide when government agents decide that superheroes need more supervision iron man robert downey jr agrees admitting that even he deserved oversight that would have possibly prevented the deaths of thousands when he accidentally invented ultron when the winter soldier under brainwashed duress is involved in another act of mass terror the battle lines get drawn explicitly team cap boasts hawkeye jeremy renner the winter soldier falcon anthony mackie antman paul rudd and the scarlet witch elizabeth olsen team iron man is war machine don cheadle black widow scarlett johansson vision paul bettany and most nerdshartly black panther chadwick boseman and spiderman tom holland then everybody fights and for anyone who has ever before loved a comic book we see the face of god to say that boseman and holland reinvigorated the franchise is a horrifyingly irresponsible understatement the rock was once called franchise viagra injected as an actor into sequels to give some more pep boseman and holland are like giving viagra some viagra from squeeinducing moments like watching spidey web up captain america to hilarious asides like iron man macking on aunt may marisa tomei to the black panther shrugging off 50 caliber bullets fired from a helicopter and being treated as inarguably the most important supporting character in terms of plot and consequence everything works everything this is the true culmination of the grand marvel experiment its not over as the ending still leaves wounds and unanswered questions but two major missing elements spiderman and a superpowered person of color helped finished the mythical mosaic theyve been slowly artfully and playfully crafting for a decade its perfectly acceptable to not like captain america civil war it simply means you care not for this particular genre because in any way i can think to analyze it represents its zenith
May 10 2019,positive,the action and the introduction of some pivotal new characters are enough to satisfy most expectations
May 6 2019,positive, while in la last month i got to be one of the first people to see captain america civil war  almost a month before it hit theaters which is today to say i was blown away is an understatement most of you know how big of a marvel fan i am so i have been looking forward to this film for a long time i knew going in that it most likely would vary from the comic books which is a good thing because i like to be surprised and joe russo one of the directors agrees with me but i was surprised by just how much it was like watching a whole new story and i loved the way they did it captain america civil war is full of action drama and even some romance i always promise no spoilers so i wont give anything away but i will say that this is my favorite marvel movie yet yes it even trumps guardians of the galaxy vol 1 as my alltime favorite the tension between captain america and iron man is done perfectly it is a story about politics and each of them is doing what they truly feel deep down is the right thing to do in the comic books i am one thousand percent teamironman but with the movie version i honestly cannot choose they both make some very valid points and i just dont know which way is the best answer i love every character in this film but the addition of tom holland as spiderman was brilliant he is incredible as peter parker he has the humor the youth and the excitement i loved watching him on the big screen as one of the most iconic superheroes out there some of you guys have asked me if stan lee makes another cameo in this film i wont say anything but has he ever missed a marvel movie before the battle scenes in this film are amazing but i will be honest it is strange to watch some of my favorite heroes fighting each other and not a common villain even though i knew this was coming it was intense to watch the airport scene is probably my favorite of the whole movie this is one really cool thing that happens that i cannot talk about because i dont want to ruin it for you guys  but watch antman closely i may have shed a tear or two during the movie as well it is truly full of emotion  there is a huge reveal at the end that had me sad and mad for one of my favorite characters you really do not want to miss this movie as with all marvel movies there are some postcredit scenes i got to see one  and there is a second one as well so i plan to go see captain america civil war for a second time this weekend for many reasons but one is to see that second scene to help celebrate the release of captain america civil war disneystorecom has lots of personalization items i could have spent hours looking through them all  but i finally settled on a black widow shirt and a scarlet witch shirt with my daughters names on the back those are two pretty strong and pretty amazing women from the film and i want my girls to have great role models the process was easy i could have put their names anywhere on the shirts and i could change color and size of the lettering as well as color of the shirt too and decided to put them on the back we are eagerly awaiting them and i cannot wait for my daughters to represent the women of civil war and show off their awesome shirts thanks to disney store check out the personalization shop here marvels captain america civil war finds steve rogers leading the newly formed team of avengers in their continued efforts to safeguard humanity but after another incident involving the avengers results in collateral damage political pressure mounts to install a system of accountability headed by a governing body to oversee and direct the team the new status quo fractures the avengers resulting in two campsone led by steve rogers and his desire for the avengers to remain free to defend humanity without government interference and the other following tony starks surprising decision to support government oversight and accountability the opinions expressed here are that of mama smiths only while the products in this post were given complimentary unless otherwise stated for me to review that does not alter my opinion of the products mentioned this post may contain sponsored links and affiliate links which will be stated at the beginning of the post tessa smith is a rotten tomatoes tomatometerapproved film and tv critic she is also a freelance writer tessa has been in the entertainment writing business for ten years and is a member of several critics associations including the critics choice association and the greater western new york film critics association
Apr 19 2019,positive,it is at its heart about a very personal clash between friends and i think thats what sets civil war apart in the marvel cinematic universe canon
Apr 12 2019,positive,earthy and visceral
Apr 3 2019,positive, civil war assembles the avengers for an allout allstar battle with newcomers black panther and spiderman offering showstealing highlights appetites are left whetted for the future rather than teased for the upcoming meal the film pulls many emotional punches holding back for the sake of those same upcoming films and the intellectual battle is increasingly shaky with captain america at his least heroic yet the pace cant keep its gallop and the fights cant keep their wallop but as a convergence and dispersion of all which has come before civil war is a resounding victory civil war is agrade filmmaking as confident as it is competent and a shiny stone in marvels gauntlet the series future is safe in the russo brothers hands moonlighting as a reviewer and editor im more at home with recent films than golden oldies and enjoy appreciating the technical achievements as much as the escapism of the movies happy to try any film once if only for fifteen minutes i also volunteer with medicinema  a charity which every film fan should look into if they dont already know about
Mar 11 2019,positive, the buzz over the latest marvel blockbuster has been through the roof its already made over 200 mil internationally before it even opened here in the us so no doubt it will wipe out any competition here this weekend i have to say that despite my increasing superhero fatigue i was still looking forward to this one mostly because i love the first two captain america films and i have faith in the russo brothers direction like zack snyder with batman v superman anthony  joe russo had the tricky task of not only continuing the thread of the avenger story pulling off a large ensemble cast and help launchintroduce individual standalone films black panther spiderman suffice to say the russos did a much much better job than snyder in delivering an entertaining summer blockbuster thats actually has depth and thoughtprovoking ideas interesting that the avengers and superman share a similar predicament in their effort to safeguard humanity and how the dc and marvel tentpole movies are dealing with the issue of accountability the civil war in the title stems from an ideological conflict about what should be done in that issue of accountability and collateral damage and whether a governing body in this case the un should oversee them now the fact that the perceived common enemy happens to be steve rogers chris evans bff bucky aka the winter soldier sebastian stan its easy to see which side the cap is on the events in the winter soldier has undoubtedly made cap wary of big government and how a centralized power could be manipulative and corrupt so it makes sense that he wont be so easily persuaded to sign something like the sokovia accords thatd essentially put the avengers under un control natasha romanoffblack widow just because its the path of least resistance doesnt mean its the wrong path staying together is more important than how we stay together  whilst the motive behind captain firmly believing in selfregulation is more clear cut im not as convinced why tony stark would support it with little resistance a cameo by alfre woodard briefly reveals the burden of guilt on tonys part as the stark companies supplies most of the weaponry including captain himself who was created in the lab of his dad howard but still id think hed be more apprehensive about government interference in the avengers i have to say that the film has a pretty slow start i understand theyd have to establish the conflict and a reason for all the fighting but it went on a bit too long for my liking and frankly it all feels a bit tedious thankfully things do pick up as soon as an incident happens at the un meeting and before you know it captain becomes a hunted man wanted by the government along with bucky its there that we meet new marvel cinematic universe mcus member black panther chadwick boseman and he certainly looks the part this is perhaps one of the most diverse cast in a marvel film aside from the xmen franchise i think the fact that the same writers christopher markus and stephen mcfeely are involved in the captain america trilogy so far makes the film flow nicely and has a cohesive storyline they also did a decent job showing the events in previous films to viewers who might not be familiar with the avengers story ie the battle in the fictional eastern european country sokovia in avenger age of ultron that caused massive collateral damage marvel fans would especially enjoy the references and inside jokes especially during the actual civil war battle involving a dozen mcu superheroes this is also the first time we see the new spiderman tom holland as part of mcu and hes definitely a highlight spidey is supposed to be a wisecrackin teenager and hollands captured that all his comments as hes fighting the other heroes like referencing empire strikes back and saluting cap before he fights him are a hoot the intro to the appropriatelyaged character is full of good humor as hes fanboying over iron man who somehow still has time to flirt with aunt may marisa tomei robert downey jrs costar in the romcom only you despite a brief 36hour deadline to arrest cap theres a lot of fanboying going on in this movie thats so hilarious my fave part is when antman the immensely affable paul rudd meets cap which got one of the biggest laughs in the theater captain america civil war is commendable for having the right balance of story character emotion humor and highoctane action the fight scenes are wellchoreographed that you can actually see the action despite the sheer number of people fighting it wasnt so bombastic that its headacheinducing the story never feels cartoonish even with so many characters involved and the battles feel sprightly and fun without being frivolous or silly when one character is injured we feel the emotion of fellow team members and the sense of solidarity is definitely there the captain america trilogy benefits from the strong base of stevebucky relationship established in the first film i totally believe why cap would go to such length to protect his best friend and stand by his side regardless of what hes done and i think bucky wouldve done the same if the situation were reversed i love evans and stan even more as they become more at ease in their respective roles and anthony mackie is always so charming and fun as falcon i also have to mention how i appreciate scarlett johanssons black widow more and more and the fact that shes undeniably torn between the two sides is a testament to her intriguing character arc the key in making a huge ensemble cast work is they have to have a reason for us to care for the characters its getting immensely tricky here but i think keeping the focus on just a small group helps the final battle between cap iron man  winter soldier is not only cool to watch but it also carries a certain emotional weight because theres something personal that affects the three of them its perhaps one of the most compelling dramatic moments from rdj that ive seen in all the iron man  avengers movies so far that said i dont think this film is perfect and i dont think its the greatest mcu film so far as many critics have said ive mentioned about the rather sluggish start but there are also moments that dont really work daniel brühl is a perfectly capable actor but he barely makes a dent here amongst an ocean of characters though i think the characters motive is a pretty decent one the romance between cap and sharon carter also feels so obligatory and the lack of chemistry between evans and emily vancamp doesnt help oh how i miss hayley atwells agent carter whos such a strong female character who doesnt need any superpowers to make a difference i also find the music unmemorable as i barely remember any of it which is odd given i love what henry jackman did with the winter soldier all in all its a very good film that ties all three captain american movies superbly well and would rank amongst the best film trilogies after this im even more confident in the russo brothers directing talent and mcu is definitely in capable hands if they continue to make marvel movies i love the end credits of the first two captain america movies and they did an excellent job here as well in terms of replayability value this one ranks third after the winter soldier and the first avenger both of which i actually just rewatched last night and i still enjoyed them immensely i saw the film earlier today as i scored the last ticket for the morning show and i had fun as did the audience i watched it with  antman black panther and spiderman  they were a blast  i think they hit paydirt with boseman as black panther as he really became the character and im glad hes going to get his own film  tom holland for me now is the best peter parkerspiderman  he gets it right  he is very funny but also kinda nerdy and hes so impossible to dislike theres a lot of other things in the film i like such as natasha being torn as it is obvious how close she is with steve and was there for him during that moment where he is filled with loss  i also enjoyed elizabeth olsens performance as wanda maximoffscarlet witch as someone who is trying to find her footing but also has some guilt where that little she has with rogers i thought was a nice touch where i think steve sees her as a little sister of sorts and can comfort her  it was a lot better than i thought it would be while i also found myself laughing a lot  including the moments between falcon and bucky as i could watch those 2 banter at each other  heres my review btw hi steven ill check out your review latre today yes i think boseman and holland were great additions to mcu i love how regal boseman was and how nerdy holland was which was appropriate for the character yes i really like natasha being torn i think that her scene w bucky cap  black panther was one of the highlights of the film as well i really love the trio of bucky cap and falcon saw it last night and loved it i didnt mind the slow build up in the first half reminded me of the older bond films in fact this one feels even more like a espionage film with all those different locations im going to see it again next week at the imax theater so far its a toss up between this one and the winter soldier as the best film in the marvel universe im surprised that not too many people mention black panther as one of the highlights seems like spiderman and antman are getting more love but to me black panther got my attention and looking forward to his solo film i love the climatic battle between the three characters too i thought for sure theyll team up and fight those other winter soldiers and a super villain will show up glad they didnt pull a batman vs superman trick and kept the focus on the conflicts between iron man and capt hi ted i thought you had seen it at imax already i dont know yet if id have time to see it again i still think the winter soldier has more of the suspense of an espionage film and frankly im not crazy about the way they introduced the different locations in cw w those huge fonts its like theyre screaming at you or something i like both black panther and spiderman though the latter is a lot more fun to watch i guess because hes inherently funny yes i think keeping the focus on just iron man  capt w bucky in the middle is wise because ultimately its their battle the rest are their allies no i saw it at the icon atmos theater friday night mostly because of the reserved vip seats you can reserve seats at the imax theater now but i know its going to be packed and didnt want to sit next to a lot of people i usually go to a matinee showing at the imax theater because its not that busy during the day nice i know youre not into superhero movies jordan but the captain america films are so good and even the second film felt more like espionage films than a straight superhero movie oh you have seen that one glad to hear it jordan this one is by the same duo directors and has a similar espionage feel to it but it does have a boatload more superheroes thats why i still prefer winter soldier to this third one hmmm its raining like all hell massive winds and the cinema around the corner is of course playing it i might go see it just to get away from the wind rattling everything in my house and cos it is by the same directors that is what has me interested so often franchises are directed by a different guy each time around oh man that sounds nasty i remember those torrential rains back when i still live in jakarta hey watching civil war sounds like a perfect way to escape from nasty weather yes i think its always a good idea to have the same director direct an entire franchise thats why the nolan dark knight trilogy is so good that said i did like the first captain america film and its decidedly retro look and feel i havent seen the first one only winter soldier and the first avengers movie which i didnt like at all so i dont think ill get lost and i must admit that there were parts of winter soldier that i liked a lot what i really hate though is the almost obligatory city being smashed to bits using cgi in the final act even deadpool had that ahah special powers too funny well i only suggest this one to you as you like winter soldier id think youd be curious what happens to well the winter soldier himself aka bucky i like the first captain america and no city was blown to bits in that one  i agree its irritating when they do that i know youd absolutely hate man of steel and dawn of justice because the destruction is even more atrocious  hey ruth great review as always  i agree with a lot of what you say about civil war  id rate it as one of the best of the marvel films it does get off to a slowish start but im just glad in the end a decent balance between story character and action was achieved black panther was certainly a highlight as was spidey although i did miss andrew garfield a little but tom holland did a great job and i had the same thoughts about henry jackmans score like you i loved the winter soldier soundtrack but there werent any standout musical elements in cw hehe nice to see your name commenting on my captain america review for obvious reasons  this one is definitely one of the best mcu films but i still think the winter soldier as my fave i just rewatched the first two this weekend actually i dont miss the previous spidey actors though by no means am i clamoring to see the new spidey movies i do think holland fits the role of a teenage peter parker very well funny they went w another brit again for the role this ones going to be interesting to watch once the bluray comes along and people get to really pull the film apart i think the film plays better to a large cinema audience than it does at home alone with peter parkers introduction scene coming out of nowhere and bringing the film to a complete halt that said i did enjoy this one a lot and cant wait to delve deeper into it i thought the russos did an amazing job considering all the balls they had in the air with this project i dont envy their task ahead in infinity war thats for sure and the film balanced comicgeek action with subtle character direction something sadly lacking from the bombast of batman v superman a film i did enjoy despite its flaws  best bit for me the moment of comprehension between panther and  on the ice tundra toward the end of the film where tchalla comes to understand that his revenge would only ever be a hollow victory a great quiet wonderful character beat between two characters both diametrically opposed and uniquely similar and it summed up the entire film in a single scene for me hi rodney interesting perspective about spidey intro i dont think it brought the film to a halt though there was a slight pause in the film as the entire cast was looking at him but i think hes a fun addition to the avengers yes very true the russos had so much juggling act to do w this one and infinity war i hope itll be eons better than age of ultron ah yes that scene w black panther  bruhls character is a good one the quiet moment still had as much power as the bombastic one and thats a testament to the great acting and direction i dont have superhero fatigue but am getting pretty close to marvel fatigue until civil war which was a blast almost from start to finish i think i preferred the winter soldier but not by much i agree with you that iron mans motivations were a little unclear and from everything i know about the characters i feel like iron man should have been fighting against the accord and captain america should have been towing the company line i actually have more of a dc fatigue than marvel because dawn of justice made me even less interested in seeing all those individual movies like the flash aquaman etc the only one im still excited about is wonder woman for obvious reasons yeah i thought the reverse pov of the two characters might throw off some people but i think w cap the events in winter soldier w hydra infiltrating shield made him distrustful of big government so it makes sense oh i still have hope for dc batman and superman have been wellcast and im hoping the flash and aquaman standalone films will be good since zach snyder wont be making them great review i loved this film so much im glad you pointed out the lack of chemistry between vancamp and evans because that entire relationship was the low point for me bruhl was underused but i didnt mind because the conflict wasnt really about him he was just the puppeteer and i wouldve be surprised if he returned for infinity wars hi brittani glad to hear you love this too i never liked vancamp even from winter soldier i think the fact that peggy had just died made it weird that cap was kissing her so soon i think bruhls bound to be underused considering there are just way too many characters already but i think he still did a good job i love the cap movies its my second fave superhero trilogy now after nolans dark knight i never wouldve predicted that given that initially i wasnt even excited for a captain america movie i really enjoyed this one i dont want to say its the best mcu movie because i just saw it but i am having a hard time thinking of a better one for my money there are only 3 other contenders for that crown the avengers the winter soldier and guardians of the galaxy i think our divergence on this can be traced to the start i didnt find it tedious at all but i did on the winter soldier glad we agree that it is excellent overall i dont know if its the best mcu though its right up there im glad you love winter soldier too dell thatll be in my top 3 marvel movies for sure oh really thats too bad i love the captain america movies even though initially i didnt even care for the character as i dont read the comics but the trilogy is now my favorite give it a shot who knows you might end up liking it too so youre saying you havent even seen the first avenger i actually rewatched the first two movies after i saw civil war and still love both of them the winter soldier still tops it for me though but only by a small margin nah ive seen all the avengers film age of ultronive just missed a few here and there not sure if id get what was going on because i was really confused in age of ultron  i dont like ultron either too much going on jumbled together thats why i like the cap movies as the story is more focused and i love the capbucky friendship that drives the conflict hello zoë oh i still prefer the first two cap movies to civil war i think the fact that there are less characters in those made me like it more i didnt care for the last avengers either but the first one is ok perhaps theres that novelty factor as wed just seen all of those marvel superheroes in one movie for the first time oh will do but even before reading it im totally ok if you rip it to shreds man ill still be reading your blog  btw i did review an indie movie last friday that i think you would enjoy in fact i cant wait to rewatch it again film is in my blood love movies of all genres from jane austen to james bond official blogger for the twin cities film fest tcff ive written and produced my first short film  hearts want in 2017 and currently working on developing the full story as a feature film
Mar 2 2019,positive, whose side are you on  the phrase attached to the marketing campaign around captain america civil war which im going to alternately title the marvel clash of the titans is something ive been spending wayyyyy too long thinking about after having my entire face blown off by almost nonstop 3d action at the imax  most of civil war is spent with those characters chasing each other in cars kicking each other in the throat and smashing each other into concrete that 15 is good though   props to having a villain that uses brains instead of brute strength or you know mystical powers acquired from an alien object and the way the division of the teams happens is pretty boss too thats all im going to say about that plot just because i think its a better film if you dont know everything i will say though that one of the best things about civil war is that it introduces two more heroes in pretty great ways  1 black panther who in my opinion kind of stole the show and 2 yet another reboot of spiderman which i actually think they finally got right that fx though fucking incredible like it must have taken them forever to get all that stuff just right that point is really hammered home after you sit through the approx 1 million fx artists listed in the credits to view the second postcredit sequence so whose side am i on teamcap or teamironman um teamscarletwitch obvs because shes a fucking badass i was super stoked to see both her and black widow get as much screen time as they did and taking out at least as many bad guys as the boys speaking of  hey marvel when are we gonna get standalone movies about black widow  scarlet witch followed up by a widowwitch team sequel
Feb 21 2019,positive, in large part what made joe and andrew russos captain america the winter soldier such a successful and somewhat transcendent superhero movie was that its going concern wasnt a global or even galactic catastrophe but a personal one the friendship between brooklyn bros steve rogers chris evans and james buchanan bucky barnes sebastian stan threatened to fall apart over the course of the films explosive events though in the end their lifelong bond endured im with you to the end of the line captain rogers says to his brainwashed killingmachine friend at the close of winter soldier in a chilling melodramatic declaration of brotherly love their bond is once again the beating heart of the story in the russos followup captain america civil war and its the key ingredient that makes marvel studios latest offering their best yet unlike last years avengers age of ultron civil war is an ensemble superhero movie whose heroes dont get lost in all the asskicking commotion sure theres more than enough asskicking to satisfy even the most rabid mcu fan more on that later but the impressive thing is that each character has an emotional arc thats at once affecting and easy to keep track of take for example elizabeth olsens scarlet witch in age of ultron we learned that her parents were killed in a cityleveling act of war at the outset of civil war we see her on the other side of that scenario as we watch her inadvertently kill innocents during an avengers mission in nigeria the wicked irony of the situation leaves her in an awful state of mind but she finds solace in the arms of her otherworldly android teammate vision paul bettany whos feeling romantic butterflies in his semisynthetic belly for the first time youll find simple affecting side stories like this running throughout the movie but the going concern is the moral divide between steve rogers and tony stark robert downey jr following the destructive events in nigeria the governments of the world decide its time for the avengers to answer to a higher power stripping them of the liberty to choose when and where to act tony tormented by guilt the lives lost in nigeria new york and sokovia as a result of the avengers gigantic battles hang over his head like the sword of damocles is in favor of the proposal steve still feels the world is safest in the avengers unshackled hands some of the heroes vote with tony like vision his best buddy war machine don cheadle and the painfully conflicted black widow scarlet johansson falcon anthony mackie goes into hiding with his captain and they finally track down bucky the everelusive winter soldier whos deemed public enemy number one when hes framed for recent deadly terrorist attacks when steve uncovers that the person responsible for the attacks is a man named zemo daniel bruhl he gathers fresh recruits to help him stop the mad bomber including scarlet witch antman paul rudd and hawkeye jeremy renner tonys counter move is to recruit two new faces to the mcu the black panther chadwick boseman and a bright superpowered teenager from the bronx named peter parker tom holland yes spidermans mcu debut is as amazing no pun intended as anyone could have hoped the ensuing clash between team stark and team rogers taking place in an evacuated leipzighalle airport is the most gloriously nerdy thing ive ever seen its so fun i wanted to burst with the russos giving each of the heroes an incredibly cool moment or two to flex their powers in strange and inventive ways what really puts things over the top is the dialogue which showcases each characters colorful personality in an economic wildly entertaining way spiderman is fascinated by buckys metal arm holland is terrific antman is still getting used to the abilities he gained in his solo movie he even breaks out a new trick and black widow and hawkeye discuss how bizarre it is to be fighting each other as they pull their punches  the airport showdown shot in glorious imax is hard to top but the climactic oneonone battle between iron man and captain america with poor bucky caught in the middle raises the stakes to new levels of tearjerking high drama the unexpected star of the show here is rdj who gives not just his best performance as stark but one of the best performances of his career civil war is as much his movie as it is evans and the emotional rollercoaster he takes us on is unpredictable and utterly heartbreaking civil war is the best thing marvel studios has produced not only does it work well as the third act of the ballad of steve and bucky but it sets up the future of the mcu brilliantly i cant wait to see how the odd mentorpupil relationship between tony and young peter parker develops in next years spiderman homecoming and the romance between scarlet witch and vision is so strange and delightful that it may be one of the main reasons people will shell out even more dough when we arrive at avengers infinity war or whatever theyre calling it these days then theres black panther whose forthcoming solo movie will mark the first minorityled and directed entry for marvel studios somehow eight years in the future of the everexpanding mcu looks brighter than ever
Feb 3 2019,positive, so im going to watch avengers infinity war tomorrow or today when this review goes up but i didnt really have the time to watch a lot of mcu films leading up to it in fact i just squeezed this one in but still lets have a look at civil war the film that could be argued as the real avengers 3 though i feel thats unfair given the focus is still very much on captain america rather than the ensemble of heroes around him its also the film that introduces us to both the mcus spiderman and black panther the latter of whoms solo film would turn out to be more successful than the former which no one would have guessed a few years ago so lets dive in its scenes like this that make me appreciate how far the mcu has come i mean antman and scarlet witch are in the same scene and both are just as legitimate a character as cap crazy but great times helmut zemo daniel bruhl  zemos wife child and father were killed in the sokovia incident since then he has been blinded by thoughts of vengeance against the socalled heroes he deems solely responsible scott lang  antman paul rudd  lang is a thief who believes he can become a hero now he has the power of hank pyms suit and particles well its time to put that to the test before we get the more obvious actionoriented bit i want to praise the job this film does balancing the cast and giving the large cast so much to do captain america is still very much himself sticking to his principles and his allies and tony stark is still very much arrogant but also afraid and racked with guilt over things hes done and once again hes taking command and throwing what he can at the problem to make it go away this is why their break up works bucky is somewhere in between his old self and the winter soldier but by the end of the film hes back to being like an old ally to cap again which makes it all the more heartbreaking when his past comes back to haunt him once again right at the end just when everyone found common ground tony finds out bucky killed his parents and then thats it all bets are off the harsh words and brutal fight between cap and iron man at the end of the film is great and dramatic and the very end when tony demands steve leave the shield behind because my father made that for you is a proper hit in the gut and really makes you believe that there friendship is irreversibly damaged then theres the fact that while doing all this the film also introduces both black panther and spiderman to the mcu handily skipping the origin stories for their respective solo films and still by the time the big airport fight scene happens you feel theyre just as part of the cast as the characters who have been around since film 1 tom holland just owns the role from scene one and bosemans black panther and his slip to hatred and vengeance followed by his redemption is a great story arc thats a true credit to both the writing and the acting that all that happens in the middle of a captain america vs iron man film and it still fits to top it all off you have some great scenes with black widow being torn as to which side to pick you have some really pleasant scenes between vision and scarlet witch and even some of the other side characters like falcon war machine and antman have at least a few funny or dramatic scenes each its no wonder the russos were chosen to juggle the infinity war cast they clearly have the knack so now lets get to the obvious the aforementioned airport fight that must have been a pain in the arse to plan and film but hats off to them because its quite the amazing show some funny moments mostly from spiderman tom holland just nails the funny midbattle quips the character is known for straight away there some dramatic moments but mostly there is just great heroonhero action antman may steal the show for me though not just for the scene when he enlarges himself ooer but i still laughed out loud in this rewatch when he gets cap to enlarge a fuel truck he had shrank and tossed only to wince when it explodes and say oh i thought that was a water truck sorry that being said some of the other fight scenes are right up there cap and winter soldier escaping the swat team has some really well shot fight scenes both using caps shield and buckys metal arm likewise the car chase straight after involving black panther is pulsepounding and winter soldiers later escape from capture that sees him outmartialarting thats not a correct phrase but whatever a bunch of characters in some short but brutal fight scenes are all really good fun to watch i also like the bit of continuity as to why wakanda is suddenly in the spotlight vibranium stolen from them was used to create ultrons superhard body so feeling responsible they started to send out humanitarian missions one of which happened to get caught up in the crossbones explosion leading to wakanda spearheading the want to put heroes under control and take part in a global conference about it it works well and makes the fact that they were a nonevent up until now make perfect sense mcu films often have the problem of a poor villain but civil war doesnt really have this problem as you can kind of argue that iron man is the lead villain that being said he and cap are manipulated into fighting by zemo so really he is the lead antagonist and while he doesnt suffer from the same problems as a lot of the other bad guys hes not perfect i mean hes nothing like the comics zemo but i dont think anyone was expecting him to walk around with a purple balaclava stuck on his face due to adhesive x so i didnt mind that in fact i like the fact he was a broken man his entire family wiped out but he knew full well he couldnt actually take the avengers in any kind of fight so instead used his intelligence to get them to take each other out instead so why is he in the bad section then his plan makes no sense it relies far to heavily on coincidence to actually be planned think about it if iron man hadnt gone to the prison to visit falcon and managed to convince him to tell him where cap and bucky were he wouldnt have been there to see the video of his parents death and turn on them i know the film is called civil war and all that but if he had just locked cap and bucky and coincidentally iron man when he turned up in a room and unleashed the five or six other superpowered winter soldiers on them it would have been a more realistic plan if not a bit more clichéd captain america civil war is jampacked full of action and great character moments dialogue and debuts yet still manages to tell a story focused on captain america on what makes him tick and his loyalty to his friends with one plothole that doesnt really derail the film its hard not to just applaud it for being able to juggle so much and still make it a satisfying film top stuff

Jan 15 2019,positive, this installment sees the avengers facing pressure to be policed by a united nation task force in light of an incident that results in collateral damage  as marvel comic entries go captain america civil war falls somewhere in the middle of the pack given the track record of success that isnt exactly a bad thing  with civil war providing what fans have come to expect while also delving into some darker territory this installment sees the avengers facing pressure to be policed by a united nation task force in light of an incident that results in collateral damage  captain americasteve rogers chris evans wants the avengers to remain free to defend without government assistance while tony starkiron man robert downey jr believes it is time that the avengers are put in check this leads to conflict between the two with fellow avengers taking sides things escalate further when a friend from rogers past emerges as the key suspect in the latest terrorist attack with rogers determined to clear his friends name following along the same lines as batman v superman civil war provides an interesting starting point  debating the pros and cons of what these superheroes do and if their actions that result in destructions of cities and some casualties are really worth it civil war seems even more invested in this premise than batman v superman making this one of the darker marvel films in the recent franchise i found the tone refreshing although some may be put off by all the chattiness and debate in a movie that is nearly twoandahalf hours long thats not to say there isnt action as well culminating in the sequence most fans anticipated  the throw down between a dozen avengers its a sequence that delivers a fun excursion that keeps the proceedings from getting too dark and heavy then there is the introduction into the disney marvel world of spiderman tom holland which breathes more life and fun into the franchise post credits tease future adventures for the web slinger which judging by his appearance here is something i am looking forward to as well captain america civil war may not be quite up to the same level as the previous captain america the winter soldier but it is still a satisfying entry into a universe that continues to expand comedy centrals jordan peele and keeganmichael key make a pretty good transition from small screen to big screen in this comedy that is a bit uneven at times but when it fires its as funny and smart as anything in recent memory peele and key play rell and clarence cousins who set out to recover rells kitten after he is kidnapped while rescuing the cat they are mistaken for ruthless killers and soon find themselves right in the middle of a gang war ive never seen the duos sketch comedy show so i cant compare this film to what fans have come to expect as an outsider however i can say that i found their chemistry quite enjoyable  and their humor worked pretty well in a feature film peele cowrote the screenplay which plays with a lot of absurd ideas one being how this kitten can basically make even the most hardened criminal turn to putty there is some really smart social commentary at times with the script taking some very nice chances at getting laughs in uncomfortable places not every joke sticks however with some bits not as inspired as the rest for every misfire though there is something pretty brilliant my favorite involving clarence imagining himself in the middle of the iconic george michael music video faith during a druginduced haze i may not have laughed at everything in keanu but i laughed enough to truly enjoy myself keanu is rated r for violence language throughout drug use and sexualitynudity and is now playing at the regal bowling green stadium 10 and highland cinemas in glasgow
Jan 9 2019,positive, one of the biggest problems with superhero teamup movies is making sure that they dont feel like a paintbynumbers action kaboom where the only benefit is familiar characters and the main way to make sure that doesnt happen is to make said familiar characters emotionally invested in the current conflicts outcome beyond the whole wemustwintheday schtick what im saying is this movie should really be titled captain america help we are all full of feelings and thats a very good thing its frankly astounding that any film can contain so many separate distinct character arcs and still come out clean that said civil war doesnt quite feel like a single story more a series of vignettes interspersed with some very imaginative action sequences thats not to say that the film lacks cohesion only that any film with this many main characters usually ends up with a slight love actually vibe i just compared a marvel movie to love actually apparently anything is possible in this bizarre universe we live in for those who are familiar with the comics the narrative of the movie might come as something of a surprise rather than a registration act that requires superheroes to give up their secret identities something of a redundancy in the mcu when so many of them dont bother the government regulation that our heroes are asked to consider is at the behest of the united nations who would like control of when and how the avengers are deployed tony thinks this is a good idea steve does not then peggy carter passes away and her niece sharon shares a quote from her aunt at the funeralone that advises a young sharon to compromise until she cannot and then stand firm and make the world bend to her needless to say steve takes that advice to heart joss whedon had initially said that he wanted the second avengers film to be a deeply personal affair and many comics fans assumed that he was going to tackle the civil war arc as a result instead we got age of ultron which was enjoyable in some aspects a bit of a mess in others and not anywhere near as personal as we might have expected now we have captain america civil war a film in which every single character decision is deeply personal deeply emotional whats impressive about the undertaking is how everyones points of view are entertained and while there might be certain characters you agree with overall no one is depicted as entirely unsympathetic or even entirely wrong its an inevitable step between a team full of vastly opposing personalities but a painful one at the core of this fight are captain america and iron man and deciding whose team youre on is a far woollier choice than audiences might have expected its easy to blame tony stark for these proceedings because tony is egotistical and arrogant even when he means well and that makes him appear at fault more often than not but the film is good at showing the places where steve rogers is uniquely unbendable places where he could compromise and chooses not to places where his righteousness is less appealing the truth of the matter is that steve doesnt want the avengers under un control because steve rogers doesnt trust anyone in response to idea of these sokovia accords he feels obligated to point out that every member every country has their own agenda which is a fair point but fails to include the fact that all people generally do himself included captain america doesnt really trust the will of the peoplehe thinks its far safer for the avengers to use their own judgment on what missions they take this is in keeping with steves development in the mcu particularly as it pertains to winter soldier when he tried to put his trust in the system it turned out that hydra was behind that system all along on the other side of this we have tony stark who despite being overlyinsistent that all problems are his problems is mainly desperate to keep his friends safe that is his primary motivation throughout the entire process a motivation that makes more sense when we learn that his relationship with pepper potts hasnt been working out on the one hand im hardly surprised given his recent activities on the other hand no you take it back these are the only people that tony stark has in the whole world but he doesnt know how to get that across or rather he chooses not to get that across because most of his personal relationships end in abnegation death or you know attempted murder thanks obadiah to his credit these are problems that he is clearly trying to work through at the outset we discover that tony has developed an immersive virtual reality therapy app of sorts one that allows people to reach into their memories and relive traumatic events with better outcomes to receive closure he shows an entire room of students his final memory of his parents and manages to tell his father that he loves him before howard and maria drive to their deaths both tony and steve have viable reasons for thinking that theyre doing the right thing both of them make serious errors in judgment as a result tony puts wanda under house arrest and steve causes a fair share of collateral damage in effort to help bucky escape capture both of them wish they could compromise their way out of this but both of them have wildly different ideas about what compromise should entail and then bucky is hijacked and steve is useless for negotiations from that point forwardparticularly once bucky tells him that their current enemy col helmut zemo daniel brühl seems to be after the other five winter soldiers programmed by hydra steve rogerss fight with hydra has been a fascinating sticking point for the character throughout these films because they turned out to be the power behind shield the protective organization that howard stark and peggy carter built and also behind buckys brainwashing into the winter soldier captain americas stake in dismantling hydra is personal beyond his role in fighting them during wwii bucky is most personal of all these offenses steves only living link to his past once peggy is gone his best friend throughout the majority of his life which makes it all the more interesting that even bucky calls steve on his devotion by the end of the film positing that hes not worth so much trouble of course from a personal standpoint bucky is but his comment could almost be read an in indictment of steves unwillingness to take pause and think where his best friend is concerned from the springboard of tony and steve we come to the other avengers who all have different stakes in this fight sam wilson has been on board with helping cap find his pal since day one but having the winter soldier in the back of their getaway car turns out to be even less enjoyable than he imagined the prickly camaraderie that develops between bucky and sam is easily one of the highlights of the film rhodey is on tonys side due less to their long friendship than to his respect for chain of command every inch the respectable soldierlets be honest regulation is everything hes been asking for from tony since iron man 2 vision believes there is a correlation in the escalation of threats to the multitude of super peoples and believes that oversight could only help hawkeye backs steve because hes never been tonys biggest fan in the first place and nothing defines clint barton so well as being a perpetual underdog antman joins cap because hes just jazzed to be there also hank pym isnt exactly a fan of the stark family black widow plays her cards close as always but the truth is easy to discern in the few words she chooses to say the avengers have become her family all she really wants is for that family to stay whole even if it means being regulated but once she realizes that steve wont be won over she backs off giving up on the hope that the conflict will be resolved easily the person in this film who feels most done wrong by is wanda maximoff on both a realworld level and a storytelling level she is badly treated once the conflict is underway because of her nearunlimited and dangerous powers a treatment made worse for the fact that visionthe one supervising her house arrestappears to have a crush on her on the one hand vision is young by existence standards making it easy to read his attentions as boyish and harmless on the other hand its discomfiting that wanda should be held at bay by someone harboring such feelings and these attentions make vision seem manipulative and controlling at the very least she gets the last word telling him that she cannot control the fear she instills in others only her own fear but it doesnt change the fact that the movie seems at a loss for what to do with wandas power and that alone feels circumspect in a universe harboring figures like thor and the hulk in the midst of these characters that we know we are gifted two new facestchalla of wakanda and peter parker of queens black panthers arrival to the mcu is a long time coming and chadwick boseman plays him with incredible poise and grace we get all of two minutes introduction to him and his father and the position of wakanda in this world and thats really all we need to get invested though we obviously want much more because tchalla believes that bucky is responsible for his fathers death it seems as though were in for a standard revenge plot yet it is black panther alone who is able to put aside his allconsuming desire for vengeance and step away before it is too late it is a perfect introductory arc in keeping with what comics fans know of tchalla a man known for his intelligence and consideration its going to be hard to wait for that solo film now our surprise package comes in the form of a brand new spiderman which confused a fair share of viewers leading up to the films release seeing as he was being played by andrew garfield only two years ago but tom hollands take on parker is finally as young as spiderman was at his inception a teenager being played by an actual teenager for the record peter is supposed to be fifteen years old and holland was seventeen when he was cast whats more this is the first version of spiderman who appears to come from a visibly lower class bracket he lives in an old crowded building in queens his room is cramped and awkwardly shaped and nothing that he owns looks new hollands awkwardness lends peter an authenticity that audiences have never seen on screen spidermans oneliners are more a product of nervousness than true wit and tonys first meeting with the wonder kid makes it abundantly clear that they have a future as mentor and apprenticenot only is tony the right guy to upgrade peters equipment but they have something key in common they both chose to become superheroes due to an overpowering sense of guilt peter tells tony than when someone with his kind of powers chooses not to use them people get hurt an obvious reference to the death of uncle ben the avengersonavengers remix battle is one of the most entertaining fight sequences that a marvel movie has ever produced and thats mostly down to a sharp balance of levity and pain this has a lot to do with the fact that very few of these people are personally angry with each other and a few of them have no emotional investment in the fight whatsoever antman merely does whats asked of him with no particular upset toward anyone who knocks him down a peg spiderman is going on tonys orders and only aims to capture never to wound hawkeye and widow are basically playfighting to the point where wanda tosses natasha out of the way because clint was pulling his punches for all the real fear bound up in this fight theres an equal amount of love that simply cant be quashed that all comes to a close when cap and bucky get away on the avengers jet with war machine and falcon in pursuit tony orders vision to take down falcon but hes distracted by wandas injuries and misses hitting rhodey instead and sending him into a free fall watching him hit the ground as iron man and falcon struggle to reach him is sickening and while rhodey survives the fall his immobilizing injuries make him the true casualty of this war ever the soldier he later tells tony that he stands by the choices that he made that he has always known the risks of combat and continued to do his job its an absolution of sorts but not one that tony stark is likely to take to heart the final act comes when tony receives the information he needs to confirm caps story proof that bucky was not responsible for the un bombing that killed tchallas father but the extra information that steve and bucky were going on proves to be a red herring zemo an oddly silent villain through the tales proceedings has killed off the remaining winter soldiers and offers up something else insteadfootage of a mission taken on by the winter soldier in 1991 footage of james buchanan barnes murdering tonys parents and when tony asks the most important question of allwhether or not steve knew bucky had done thissteve rogers is not able to give his usually noble answer instead he has to admit that he protected his friend and has known all along all superhero villains tend to be more interesting when they have a real personal connection to the people they are trying to destroy its the reason why ronan and ultron are ultimately less engaging than loki and the mandarin in zemo we have someone who is not acting out of a desire for power or glory but a man who simply wants to ruin the avengers lives for ruining his and in his strange wisdom he knows precisely how to do it he knows exactly what buttons to push he knows that tony stark will want to kill bucky barnes for murdering his mother not his parents not his father his mother and he knows that steve rogers will never allow that to happen and while tonys revelation is immediate and horrific it is steve that were to watch because the movie isnt called iron man civil war is it its not even called avengers civil war its got captain americas name on it because this movie is ultimately here to teach us something about him what we haveas we always didis a beautifully unique rendition of a character who would have been easy to paint in a stale dull hue this version of captain america postulates that the true way to be the greatest american is to be an individualist albeit a truly empathetic one steve rogers really isnt much of a team player in a universal sense hes not a good little soldier hes only a good leader when backed by a crew that is wellsuited to his particular way of doing things hes antiestablishment at a fundamental level which is a refreshing thing to reinforce in a hero whose origins are bound up in nationalism so he fights to rescue his best friendwho deserves a second chanceat the expense of every other relationship he has forged because its the right thing to do when tony tells steve that he doesnt deserve the captain america shield steve chooses to discard it and this seems to work on two levels first off tony has conflated the image of captain america with the man steve rogers which is to be expected given how howard built the man up to his son as a figure to emulate secondly steve has no difficulty casting aside the symbol that is captain america particularly in that moment if it means saving buckys life and this is central to everything that makes steve the man who can wear that uniform in the first placeas the saying goes no one who is capable of getting themselves elected president should be allowed to do the job and by the end of the film steve pointedly understands that as well the letter he leaves tony is half apology half selfrealization he acknowledges that withholding information on the death of tonys parents was a selfish move on his part he acknowledges that he has always been a man apart from others and that in this capacity the avengers belong more to tony than they ever have to him but he also acknowledges that he cannot walk away from tony stark or their friends that he cannot leave the role of captain america he can only pause his portrayal of it so he gathers their team and tells tony that they will wait for his call emmet asherperrin had so much excess adrenaline after watching that movie she probably could have stopped a moving car too you can bug her on twitter and tumblr and

Dec 8 2018,positive, last month i was severely disappointed with the meeting of two comicbook titans on the screen batman v superman shot big but missed  with film trailers pointing to a rich philosophical divide between bruce  clark culminating in what could have been the battle royale of all things geekdom instead the film was a mess one failing at the heavy task of worldbuilding multiple franchises for warner bros while trying to build a coherent narrative worthy of the timeless heroes  i dont want to make this review a comparison piece because im sure youll find many of those on the internet formally written as articles or scribbled on random comment threads  however this instinct to bring up bvs is no accident nor is it unfair to draw a comparison as at one time both films were set to open the same day  im glad they didnt because the space of time between their releases has given me time to realize all the things that could have gone wrong with captain america civil war and im glad to say that it looks like it escaped such things wow what a fantastic film overall the two movies deal with similar themes a philosophical impasse between two heroes each being manipulated by circumstances agendas and gutfeelings  its potentially powerful material and with the vast histories of the dc  marvel universes even though both films were almost explicitly marketed as adaptations of popular story arcs dc comics the dark knight returns  marvels civil war each film plotted its own course  i believe it was the wisest course for both  still as i alluded too bvs crumbled under too many plotlines unconventional takes on longestablished characters and the burden of establishing so many new films stemming from it  civil war does not i should say this early on civil war is not avengers 25 but it is  at the heart of this film we find cap  bucky even though arguably it made a better avengers film than avengers age of ultron  we know his guilt over buckys death in captain america the first avenger almost stopped him from being the hero and guilt over what bucky had become in captain america the winter soldier warred on him as well  still in this film we see one friend who wont give up on another even when all goes against them  the war between loyalties yes is stretched between all the heroes featured in the film but at the center we see cap choose his belief in bucky even over tony stark  i would be remiss to say that our golden boy doesnt keep his shine throughout the film  i felt a real palpable shift in my own allegiance of who was right in the film when all is known in the end  my takeaway from it all in the effort to avoid spoilers is that relationships are messy and when there is a competition for loyalties someone will lose out even and especially when we do our best to not hurt them and it will have a rippling effect throughout our lives just like avengers age of ultron we get another jetsetting adventure  i lost count of how many times a city or country was plastered across the screen signalling a transition in location but we go all over here  still i didnt ever feel lost  the plot moved along at a pace that never slogged and even after a 147minute runtime i wasnt looking for it to end  crowdpleasing isnt always said as a compliment in all circles but here i can share that the theater i was in cheered laughed and awed throughout  there are some great surprises for general audiences within this film but nothing that comicbuff couldnt see coming while i could go into a lengthy dissection of all characters and their loyalties ill try to be brief in what needs to be said  someone who wont get mentioned much in many reviews but who brought the goods was william hurt returning as thaddeus ross now secretary of state  seeing him without the hulk and nary much mention of him at all was a little strange but ive always respected hurt as an actor and he didnt disappoint here acting as the face of the catalyst for dealing with the heroes recurring collateral damage through the sokovia accords a global response initiative aimed at keeping the heroes on call and in check by the world governments  this legislation is brought about alongside news of a terrorist incident implicating bucky barnes also known as the former soviet assassin the winter soldier all of this together unsettles captain america and stirs him to resist and several fall in line behind him for various reasons through the preceding marvel films we have seen these heroes witness a corrupted shield organization and they feel reason to defy the directives if on nothing else but the idea of precedence alone  on the other side we see iron man who feels guilt for the damage he and others have caused  falling in line among others behind him we have two new heroes black panther  spiderman  black panther played by chadwick boseman was probably my favorite aspect of the film his power presence and sense of duty were incredible  from his story arc we get a powerful lesson on seeking justice before vengeance merciful in ways but just as resolute  retaliation can often bring other hurts into our own lives and seeing his story spoke the most powerful lesson in the film to me spiderman on the other hand was just pure glee  hes absolutely incredible to see alongside all the others weve known in the marvel cinematic universe and his adolescent nature brought out wonderfully by tom holland made him feel unique as he played with the adults  i cant wait to see more from both characters moving forward civil war never felt beholden to world building of establishing the many films that will be following however it did feel richly constructed upon the many films made prior which is more than great  one could argue that much of the moviegoing public is spending time engrossed in multiseason storylines via streaming on netflix and amazon prime so relying upon what came before isnt the problem it could have been in years past with other properties  dont expect handholding as an audience here  youll go from scenes featuring a multicolored floating android to a man who can change his size at will  its now expected you saw all the films that preceded and if you did i believe youll be witnessing something special in the entertainment landscape serialized blockbusters where characters can drop in and out of narratives with little thought against it by the audience  im excited for all that is possible now in the marvel cinematic universe and this film just proves the quality hasnt quit yet
Nov 19 2018,positive,overall civil war is the most adult and realized film in the marvel cinematic universe and it comes highly recommended
Nov 14 2018,positive, i am slowly trying to calm myself after watching this movie inserts standing ovation and shia lebouf clap marvel shocked us all when they announced a special fan screening of captain americacivil war three weeks prior to the movie coming out normally most studios only show high profile screenings a few days before the movie launches i have to say this is probably one of the best films in the marvel universe if not the best one yet which makes sense as to why they decided to screen the movie so early cacw is also trending high on rotten tomatoes with a 100 score pre release now 92 this movie gives you more of what you were missing from avengers age of ultron in the sequel to the last captain america winter soldier in cacw we are starting to see the destruction the avengers have left behind in their plan to keep the world safe though their intentions are good many innocent people have died from the many battles of the avengers in this movie you see the toil this has taken on characters like wanda maximoff tony stark and bucky barnes to name a few this movie has a different feel from the others since despite the amazing action sequences we will talk about this later it really relied on the characters to showcase their amazing acting capabilities you see a reversal of characters between stark and rogers stark who is atoning for the wrong his weapons and his role in the avengers has made to rogers who is taking a stand for what he truly believes in and allowing himself to break the law and stand against the united nations we also see bucky who is not the evil winter soldier we saw in the first captain america movie to now a tortured sole who is remembering all of the terrible acts he has committed we finally see the once tight knit avengers take sides in who they believe is right should they stand with iron man who believes that they should be in check by the united nations or captain america who feels that the united nations serves their own agenda which might not align with saving the world for the right reasons this puts many of the avengers on opposing sides which leads to an epic showdown of our beloved heroes at an airport one of the great things about cacw is that they truly paired each opposing hero up very well which led to a realistic and glorious fight sequence in addition to our normal heroes we are introduced to two exciting new additions into the marvel cinematic universe black panther and spiderman i believe that these two characters truly stole the show chadwick boseman did a superb job as portraying black panther and does not disappoint in his action scenes the 19 year old newcomer tom holland left the audience in laughter and excitement as he did a great job of holding his own in the movie and keeping marvel fans excited for the new spiderman returning home to marvel with a great storyline and amazing special effects and actions scenes many fans will forget about the bad taste batman vs superman left in their mouths and will be excited for the new installments of marvel movies to come dc comics should be worried because civil war has definitely set the bar high and comic book fans across the world will not be disappointed
Nov 9 2018,positive, well another supersized marvel comics superhero saga hits the big screen with the selected saviour captain america taking the top billing on the marquee thus the pulsating popcorn pleaser captain america civil war arrives on the scene to giddy audiences that have been loyal and fixated on the successful spring of mighty marvel heroes that have been paraded to viewers throughout the last few years thankfully captain america civil war carries on the tradition of spry superherostudded spectacles that have been glorious and adventurous from the stable of marvelbased movies guaranteed to win over the enthusiastic hearts of avid comicbook fanboys everywhere joyously overstuffed and convincingly extensive with a superteam armed with crimefighting excess civil war seizes the moment to introduce a noteworthy twist two factions of rescuing superpowers engaging in some explosive inhouse fighting led by two of marvel comics main standouts in chris evanss captain america and robert downey jrs iron man codirectors anthony russo and rene russo were instinctively crafty to link the overly successful iron man film franchise to the captain america civil war inner circle to ensure an even more treasured toxic atmosphere superhero fans will get a thrill of witnessing the extra addons concerning other dynamic titans to join the actionpacked festivities involving team captain america versus team iron man true civil war has its share of flaws but that does not take away from this heroesincrisis flick demonstrating its ambitious overtones so what has caused the bad blood among the great and grand good guys known for protecting the world from evil dominance and destruction essentially the theme of collateral damage the involvement regarding civilianrelated deaths and injuries plus the worldwide backlash has created a controversy pitted against the avengers specifically captain america aka steve rogers and scarlet witchwanda maximoff elizabeth olsen  are responsible for the boisterous battle that caused such negative sensation resulting in political turmoil avengers head honcho iron man aka tony stark is dealing with his own personal regrets in the illadvised creation of the unpredictable ultron the political authority want to hold iron man secondincommand captain america and the rest of the avengers accountable for the global devastation that have taking its toll when trying to oversee the potential harm wreaking havoc on humanity leading the charge in putting a watchful eye on the labeled reckless avengers is secretary of state thaddeus ross william hurt that suggests the supergroup be monitored by the united nations naturally friction develops between the superheroes that either agree with rosss un restriction policies or disagree with being placed under a microscope that threatens to handcuff their freewheeling heroic duties all these contrasting beliefs eventually turn into epic backandforth confrontations where the raging avengers are at odds with each other for starkiron mans stance he is willing to toe the line and ultimately agree that his crew needs to tone down their tenacious tactics as crimestoppers iron mans consciousness particularly in the case of a disillusioned mother alfre woodward making him feel guiltridden over her sons death during an intense battle of sokovia is probably the main factor behind his decision to have his team reigned in a bit from the political watchdogs siding with iron mans viewpoint are the likes of black widow scarlett johansson vision paul bettany and war machine don cheadle as for rogerscaptain america he is not too thrilled being put in check by the intrusive governmental pencilpushers that want to scrutinise the teams every move standing with captain america firmly are falcon anthony mackie and the aforementioned scarlet witch on top of captain americas current avengersoriented strife in his contentious mingling with iron man and his ardent backers he now finds himself trying to defend his old buddyturnedwanted man winter soldier sebastian stan who is accused of killing civilians iron man believes in winter soldiers innocence and goes so far as to help him escape yeswinter soldier does come with more baggage attached to him mainly in the form of the menacing zemo daniel bruhl the russos and screenwriters christopher marckus and stephen mcfeely all attached to the previous captain america winter soldier provide the eyeful visual effects that predictably stimulate and effectively add to the overload of frenzied frolicking  in this boisterous blockbuster certainly the deepened angst among this bombastic bunch works far more solidly than what was displayed in the stiffened and problematic batman v superman the notion that the entire globe and its leaders are weary of all the collective chaos at the hands of the avengers trying to save their hides is a bit ridiculous besides why are not the foes of the avengers put on the hot coals for the societal ruination it seems rather counterproductive to chastise the noble superpowers offering the safety of mankind yet the detractors not being grateful for the services that the avengers bring to the table it is somewhat convoluted to think that the global community are sour on our heralded heroes or that the heat generated within the walls will completely destroy the avengers and their colourful capable colleagues the movies aptly entitled civil war does invite more punch to the proceedings especially when a whos who of superhero showstoppers join the feisty fray at hand the noted inclusion of defiant dogooders are packed with the likes of spiderman tom holland the retired returnee hawkeye jeremy renner antman paul rudd and nifty newcomer black panther chadwick boseman no doubt captain america civil war is the impish and energising launch pad for upcoming marvelinduced movies waiting to make their future distinctive arrival on the big screen although evans steady and charismatic captain america more than holds his own as the solo act billed in the films title one cannot overlook downeys compelling iron man as the reliable source that lifts the profile of evanss masked wonder this is indeed a collaborative big score for the glorified costumed cast but special kudos are reserved for stans killing culprit as well as bosemans african president assuming the slick and resourceful black panther yeah captain america civil war is true to its frenetic form as revved up entertainment preparing moviegoers for the upcoming summertime sizzle at the box office after all

Nov 1 2018,positive,armed with the confidence that can only come from an unprecedented record of sustained success thats without comparison in this genre civil war emerges as as the strongest offering yet from marvel studios
Nov 1 2018,neutral, with batman v superman proving unsatisfactory to many audience members craving to see their favourite heroes beat the crap out of each other all eyes are now on marvel studios to see if they can accomplish what dc fumbled but the two films have more than just duelling superegos in common both are crammed with characters from across their respective universes both are establishing groundwork for the immediate future both take inspiration from classic stories from the source material and both are really really long but whilst dawn of justice strained under the weight of its ambitions barely making it to the finish line in one piece captain america civil war balances all of its moving parts effortlessly to craft what could easily be the mcus grandest adventure yet those expecting a beatforbeat adaptation of mark millars original civil war storyline are going to be disappointed but given the state of the marvel universe right now and the companys lack of key comic book characters that was never going to happen instead the film lifts key elements whilst mostly telling its own story and in the process has turned what was originally just an excuse to force heroes into conflict into a legitimately gripping war of ethics whilst this is still caps story and his views are generally portrayed as the correct ones the film does a good job of justifying the other pointofview nobody feels drastically out of character like some did in the comics the story has a grand scope as it hops around the world and brings in so many characters old and new but unlike the competition it never feels disorienting or poorly developed even with its many disparate parts every piece is under control and everything important is kept in the foreground its this kind of thoughtful design that makes the films epic runtime breeze by and even though certain characters do have smaller parts they never feel shortchanged there is never a moment where a scene was cut too short or moment was left to drag everything is in perfect order it is however not without fault the film does blow its wad in the scale department a little too early following whats easily the most fantastic fight sequence in superhero movie history with an admittedly more emotional but less impressive final battle and the films big thirdact reveal feels a little too telegraphed and is mainly just there to reinforce conflict but the film does have a strong open ending leaving the universe in an uncertain state of flux much like the winter soldier did but again it never feels like theyre forcefully teasing future movies every other character in the marvel cinematic universe makes an appearance in this movie so covering everyone is just going to be redundant long story short every returning player is as good as ever and all are given just the right amount of screen time to shine the tempestuous relationship between chris evans cap and robert downey jrs iron man takes centre stage here and what began in the avengers as playful bickering has evolved into a true conflict of ideals but even within all their clashing they never forget that theyre usually allies and they both understand and even somewhat respect the others point of view again their motivations never feel skewed just to force hostility but within all of that are also great little character moments for the other recurring characters its great to see the antman geek out over meeting the avengers falcon and winter solider exchange barbs about leg room in a car or the burgeoning relationship between vision and scarlet witch its also fun to see william hurt return as thunderbolt ross finally connecting the incredible hulk back into the overarching story in a meaningful way now we just need abomination and leader to become relevant again but even with all that audiences are sure to be talking all about the movies fantastic introductions to black panther and spiderman chadwick boseman makes for an excellent panther balancing the characters honour and pride with a lust for vengeance turning what could have easily been yet another piece of marvel crosspromotion into a key piece of the films thematic conflict tom hollands performance as the third cinematic web slinger finally embraces the characters potential on screen creating a spiderman that is optimistic and the butt of many jokes but one who can still stand toetotoe with these powerhouses of the universe hollands screen time may be brief and it could be argued his story is superfluous to the plot but everything about his scenes is executed flawlessly and i cant wait to see him take centre stage in his own movie next summer if there is a weak link in the cast its daniel bruhl as the villainous mastermind zemo bruhl puts in a strong performance as the character but the film doesnt do a great job of explaining his motives giving only the vaguest of hints before dumping it all on us right before the end hes like a living embodiment of forced conflict everything he does accomplishes nothing but getting characters to the point of hostility that all results in some absolutely amazing fights but its still an obvious ploy nonetheless on a spectacle level civil war blows all of the other mcu movies out of the water every action sequence in this movie is absolutely onpoint and given that the second unit directors are the guys who brought you john wick that should be no surprise it really feels like the filmmakers explored every possible way these characters could utilize their powers in combat and took advantage of that creating for some truly outstanding mashups that are as imaginatively conceived as they are choreographed the camerawork and editing is fast and frenetic but never in a way that obscures the action instead it amplifies the intensity of the conflict making every blow impactful and aweinspiring the visual effects arent always completely convincing but because of how light and fantastical the film looks it manages to get away with it what they lack in believability they more than make up for in ingenuity crafting incredible moments that could have only been accomplished digitally captain america civil war delivers on all its promises to be a fantastic ride and then some proving that complex superhero movies packed with story threads and characters can be made if done with care it improves on its source material by making the conflict feel more natural and with better parallels to realworld issues rather than falling prey to petty squabbles that go against previous character development its a near flawless piece of blockbuster entertainment one that probably wont convert anyone uninterested in the franchise so far but for all us true believers invested in this universe its an absolute treat all i can now ask is this how the hell is infinity war going to top it
Nov 1 2018,positive, awhile back highlander the series show runner david abramowitz described that enterprise as a talmudic discussion with asskicking that assessment frequently springs to mind while watching captain america civil war the movie the latest in marvels cinematic universe aka the mcu unfolds with reasonable logic after the events of 2015s avengers age of ultron the world is already troubled by the fact that the avengers although they saved more people than they harmed still racked up substantial civilian casualties when the country of sekovia became unmoored from the rest of planet earth on a mission in nigeria to stop a terrorist frank grillo seeking to get his hands on a bioweapon steve rogerscaptain america chris evans and his team accidentally take out a building the united nations including the us think some oversight is in order that august body wants the avengers to sign accords that are essentially a contract saying the superheroes will deploy at the behest of the un and only then tony starkiron man robert downey jr who wasnt in nigeria is negotiating his own guilt over sekovia and after a lifetime of rebellion is thinking it might be time to let someone else make the tough choices steve who has been accustomed to siding with the government sees how this could go terribly wrong when another tragedy strikes and steves old friend bucky barnesthe winter soldier sebastian stan is the key suspect the only way for cap to keep his pal alive and find out whats really going on is for him to go rogue tony and some of the other avengers are afraid steve will get himself killed while another set of avengers agree with the captain a few extra superheroes join the fray for good measure the stakes keep climbing though one of the high points of captain america civil war is a fight among friends who are simply trying to contain one another rather than do real harm  its an intentional hoot that also addresses a multitude of those matchup questions whod win if iron man fought captain america etc etc still that whole whoisgoingtowindupversuswhom issue requires some obvious labor we can see the wheels turning with a little too much effort to get some of the challengers into position what will be intriguing to some and annoying to others is that the movie is genuinely interested in its topic captain america civil war is something like a fantasy version of eye in the sky with people who have real power debating issues that are the fantasy equivalent of drone strikes  who should get to call them and when if ever and under what circumstances are they justifiable do the agents of force know their own strength and are they the best judges of when to use it unfortunately for those of us who are invested in the talmudic discussion asskicking included the film has to shift some gears to get to the climax it wants so that the resolution winds up hinging on a different type of moral matter it seems there might also be more to be made of steve and tony winding up not only on different sides from one another but taking positions counter to their personal norms then again theres only so much that can be fit into the 146minute running time standouts in the sizable cast are evans a thoughtful downey and a charismatic chadwick boseman as an african prince who has his own superhero identity the action is usually inventive and impressive though the most startling and aweinspiring special effect is somehow getting downey to appear to be in his teens for an extended fantasy flashback sequence captain america civil war expects a certain amount of familiarity with the marvel comics universe mythos if someone happens to wander in off the street theyll still be able to follow whats going on but it helps to come in caring about these people the movie does wander offtopic just a bit at moments but for the most part this is a superhero epic with something real on its mind and the chops to present it well
Oct 31 2018,positive, its a longstanding convention in comics to pit superheroes against each other its possibly the only thing more exciting than sending a superhero off to battle the latest megalomanical villain bent on world domination but it can also be a highly problematic narrative device if its not handled properly when a hero goes after the bad guy there tends to be a clearcut reason why save the world save a friend save the whales whatever is most convenient when heroes square off against each other though there better be a damn good reason for it because there guys are all supposed to be fighting on the same side thats the heart of captain america civil war the 13th film in the marvel cinematic universe and one that not only offers heroonhero combat of the best possible kind but also gives a compelling reason why that combat should happen in the first place taking place a year after the events of age of ultron captain america chris evans and the avengers have been brought to task for the collateral damage theyve caused in their previous exploits including an opening set piece in lagos that results in the side of a populated building being blown to smithereens the united nations calls on the avengers to sign an accord limiting their authority and removing their ability to act unilaterally they would only act when sanction by an international oversight committee cap is against the idea believing it to be a hindrance to doing whats right instead of whats politically expedient while tony starkiron man robert downey jr believes its necessary to prevent more collateral damage when events involving a person from caps past result in more casualties cap and his allies go rogue in an effort to find out whos behind things while also trying to evade tony and his team who have been ordered to arrest them for going vigilante that basic plot description though doesnt truly begin to plumb the depth of the complex web of emotions and motivations that drive the film and drive allies against each other in the most dramatic of ways much like capitan america the winter soldier was much a political thriller as it was a traditional superhero film so too is civil war much more than just a 147minute menintights slugfest its an examination of not only the myth of the superhero but how or even if a superhero should operate on the same level and under the same rules as nonpowered humanity boasting the same creative team as the previous two captain america films  directors anthony and joe russo screenwriters christopher markus and stephen mcfeely  civil war is an assured confident conclusion to a trilogy that builds organically upon its established elements  a large part of what makes the film work so well is the dedication of its players nearly all of whom seem to fully inhabit their roles chris evans perfectly embodies the captains unflinching devotion to the greater good while robert downey jr is still the sarcastic egocentric flipside of that same devotion both men play the characters as more subdued this time with downey jr even bringing new and exciting facets to starks character that were only ever previously hinted at the supporting cast of the film is so large that this almost feels like a third avengers film but none of the characters seem extraneous and each one contributes to the tangled mass of humanity that makes up the films core conceit of the other heroes its the women who seem to be doing some of the heaviest lifting scarlett johansson once again beautifully underplays natasha romonoffblack widow as someone always looking for a new angle and new opportunity  even more impressive is elizabeth olsen as wanda maximoffscarlet witch one of the most damaged and vulnerable heroes but also potentially the most powerful member of the cast shes the only hero with inherent superpowers that defy basic scientific laws and because of that shes more a subject of fear and derision than any of the other avengers a fear that shes deeply internalized just dont call her a mutant unless you want to hear from 20th century foxs lawyers when she comes into her own during the climatic battle however its exciting to behold after she telekinetically separates a dueling black widow and hakweye jeremy renner she calmly reprimands hawkeye with youre pulling your punches in a way thats almost terrifying in its complete lack of emotion of course what would a marvel film be if we didnt introduce a couple new heroes and thanks to the trailers there arent any surprises as to who those are the first is black panther played with savage grace by chadwick boseman one of marvels oldest heroes and one of the few african heroes to grace superhero films panther is a potent mix of nobility and primal energy his calm almost stoic public identity is a sharp contrast to the furious noholdsbarred warrior he becomes while in his indestructible supersuit the other new addition is a littleknown hero called spiderman here played by tom holland while sony has rightly been criticized for rebooting spiderman for the third time since 2002  and for giving us yet another iteration of peter parker instead of someone like miles morales  at least they hired an actor who fully connects with the giddy whizbang attitude the webslinger is supposed to have for the first time a teenaged peter parker is played by an actual teenager and holland perfectly captures both the geeky egghead side of peter parker as well as the wow cool side of a kid suddenly getting to fight alongside the worlds biggest heroes characters aside a film like this largely lives or dies by its action sequences after all thats the main hook of the whole thing it was the beall and endall of this years batman v superman but while that film seemed intent to lean solely on a couple of growling comic book titans punching each other repeatedly for twoandahalf joyless hours the fights in civil war often come close to pure comic book excitement and unlike that film the screen is full of actual colors and plenty of light the teamonteam faceoff that makes up the end of the second act is a sprawling epic smackdown that never feels too long or too confusing and grabs hold of the audiences attention right from the start all the fights in the film are wellchoreographed and each hero is given a very specific style and move set from black widows brutal luchalibre leg holds to black panthers wirefu leaps and spin kicks if anything else the mere fact that a fight with this many diverse combatants could be staged at all is impressive in and of itself  sadly when the film steps away from the fights and away from the team capteam iron man conflict driving them things do tend to slow down significantly theres an actual villain beyond any of the heroes but hes thinlydrawn and remarkable shallow with the actor playing him giving a flat performance that doesnt even try to add any depth instead of focusing completely on the pro and antiauthority sides of the intraavengers conflict the film tries to marry that story to a different plot thread featuring a different threat and it doesnt always work well that also means that after the huge secondact team battle any fights afterward seem that much more less exciting no matter how wellstaged they are likewise it takes a while to get to the point where the avengers have no choice but to fight each other and the firstact leadup to that is uncharacteristically rough and slightly unfocused sometimes bouncing from scene to scene with the same jarring transitions that marred batman v superman once the seeds of the team conflict are planted the film finds a perfect pace and balance but the leadup is certainly a bit of a bumpy ride  the films other setback is one it also shares with batman v superman in that it can be a tad impenetrable to people outside the comic book fandom while there arent quite as many easter eggs or fanservice moments the film does assume that youve kept up with the marvel cinematic universe since the first iron man although it doesnt really reference anything in any of the hulk or thor solo films while the fight scenes and setpieces are certainly enjoyable regardless a lot of the character drama and narrative heart of the film is lost if you arent invested in the characters given the mcus massive reach and popularity it may seem like an odd criticism but its still warranted at least a little bit the scarlet witchs personal story arc in particular loses a lot of heft if you havent seen her previous appearances for instance even with these criticisms its hard not to be thrilled and captivated by civil war a film that continues marvels history of not only making exciting enjoyable films but also ones that ask deeper questions and explore themes beyond fisticuffs the heroes in marvel films are with perhaps one or two exceptions real human beings with real human motivations its telling that aside from the captain himself and the vision paul bettany the characters are almost never referred to by their code names but by their actual names when the avengers try to find their place in the world its something many of us can sympathize with because they face recognizable problems even if they face those problems with extraordinary abilities a scene where the captain tries to keep a helicopter from taking off with his bare hands is not only visually captivating because of chris evans straining every bulging muscle in his pumpedup body it also contains a surprising amount of honestlywon drama and empathy not only built up over the course of the film itself but over years of careful worldbulding and character development marvel has proven time and again that its possible to make a film thats not only as exciting and fantastical as any comic book but also as downtoearth and compelling as any character drama and civil war is certainly no exception im just like any modern woman trying to have it all loving husband a family its just i wish i had more time to seek out the dark forces and join their hellish crusade
Sep 5 2018,positive,it manages to capture the super hero team as its only ever been done in animated series its next to impossible to get this kind of emotional connectedness in a few hours
Aug 30 2018,positive,this is marvel studios best film to date bar none
Aug 27 2018,positive, those of us who have been complaining that the stakes in superhero movies have gotten ridiculously high that its always the end of the world will be relieved that captain america civil war brings things back down to earth there are no aliens no artificial intelligences no angry gods or malignant outside forces directed by joe and anthony russo civil war opens with a gorgeously choreographed set piece that ties off one of several dangling threads from winter soldier 2014 the second installment in marvels captain america franchise working gloriously as a team the avengers solve the immediate problem but create another an explosion kills people in a nearby building combine that with the grieving mother who confronts tony stark robert downey jr and the movies point seems clear all that collateral damage youve been complaining about in age of ultron and man of steel and the like it has to stop but should this team control itself or instead be placed under outside supervision stark offered an external way to put his arrogance in check basically says yes please stop me from hurting anyone else and keep my friends from getting hurt steve rogers chris evans for reasons also involving his friends disagrees the team splits and they cause a lot more collateral damage fighting about it  you get the picture except the oversight argument isnt really the point if it were there would be some gesture toward a serious argument about the good the avengers have done civil war nods to its political parallels but then focuses on the way ego fear and love drive a persons choices the divide between tony stark and steve rogers turns the movie into a sort of rorschach test do you side with cocky troubled stark who cant express his emotions but is burning up with ptsd and guilt or with rogers who doesnt trust the authorities after what happened in the previous movie that bore his name personally im for team wanda elizabeth olsen with thor and hulk absent this reformed baddie is easily the most powerful human on the team and the movie doesnt know what to do with her  an unfortunately apt statement on women in the marvel cinematic universe in general a few good black widow moments notwithstanding tony puts wanda under house arrest with vision paul bettany whose crush on her makes the entire situation extra creepy she gets another pep talk from clint jeremy renner but mostly shes there as an object of the disagreement however accidentally wanda killed people in this new enlightened world and must do the time for all of them civil war is essentially a nasty disagreement among friends that degenerates into a poweredup slap fight one of the filmmakers best choices is to have the fights collapse along with the arguments the last blowup has nothing of the opening sequences grace at least these superfriends can still crack a joke ive never been more grateful for anthony mackies light touch and for all its seriousness civil war sustains a muchneeded sense of humor
Aug 27 2018,positive,most of the films pleasures come from dorky pipsqueak tom holland taking up the mantle of spiderman and joining the fight between avengers factions
Aug 23 2018,positive,with swift pacing a generally wellrounded story and fantastic action sequences civil war is not to be missed
Aug 22 2018,positive, one of my biggest concerns about superhero movies is that the main characters zip around crashing and bashing bad guys and leave a trail of collateral damage and decimated cities in their wake no one seems to address thatuntil now in fact taking responsibility for the casualties is the very essence of captain america  civil war and the humanity in that is what makes this film one of the best marvel comic movies yet since steve rogerscaptain america chiselprofiled chris evans is a wwii hero we expect more good oldfashioned values from him and less tech which makes his clash with iron man robert downey jr all the more interesting here it seems the world powersthatbe are concerned about the heroes taking justice into their own hands without being held accountable for the lives and property lost in the process so this league of nations has come up with a pact to regulate and oversee the superheroes actions at that point it becomes all about those marvels who wish to submit to the pact versus those who dont and if you dont already know whos on which side im not going to tell you because half the fun is seeing how the heroes align also great fun is the recruitment of other superheroes from the marvel universe to bolster each side even antman paul rudd joins the fray as does spiderman tom holland i can just imagine the legal finagling it took to borrow the webbed wonder from sony which owns that particular franchise many characters are back from avengers age of ultron and the previous two captain america flicks so if you want to be on top of things you might want to take a few minutes to quickly review those films or at least look up vision winter soldier and scarlet witch even if you dont youll catch on soon enough and still have a rollicking good time this is one for the whole family and even worth the extra investment to see it in imax 3d yes you will flinch as captain america throws his mighty shield and while you might find some of the scenes a bit stretched out the film is almost twoandahalfhours long youll certainly get your moneys worth products recommended by at home in hollywood are selected by our editorial team we often receive free samples of these products some of our features include affiliate or sponsored links if you buy something through one of these links we may earn an affiliate commission or other compensation
Aug 22 2018,neutral, the newest superhero movie batman v superman  um i mean captain america civil war  is truly just a duplicate plot with different faces this begs the question are dc detective comics and marvel writers actually friends do they hang out and pitch ideas to one another one would think so after seeing both of these rather dull comic book representations there is however a difference with captain america civil war  the film has a dizzying number of superheroes to keep track of and include in the story line clocking in at two hours and 26 monotonous minutes it seems the end never will be in sight bombarded by nonstop nauseating handtohand combat and 3d special effects captain america civil war finds an ethical barrier to crime fighting and protecting the world as the avengers band together to get the bad guy an errant fireball tossed by scarlet witch elizabeth olsen kills hundreds of people well it seems that this isnt the first time these crime fighters have killed a few dozen innocent people in their attempts to protect the world from evildoers now the united nations feels compelled to put their foot down and reign in this out of control group captain america chris evans wants nothing to do with being told who to kill and who to save but iron man robert downey jr sees the logic the two part ways with their minions scurrying behind them until the two teams are pitted against one another sound familiar see batman v superman review from the opening scene there is nonstop action its not highintensity action though its slowmotion framebyframe action that creates a visually disturbing blur of images the feeling is similar to stopmotion as you watch the fighting it sometimes becomes confusing as to whos fighting for whom and why unless you are an avid fan doom and gloom is the dramatic and repetitious story line and unfortunately there is very little levity in the dialogue the writers address the absence of thor and the incredible hulk giving them an acceptable excuse for not being a part of this film and for all you scarlett johansson fans you wont be disappointed as the minutes tick by it isnt until ant man paul rudd and the new spider man tom holland enter the scene with some snappy dialogue that wakes you up overall the lack of ingenuity makes for a lackluster story in need of major content editing this film is definitely geared toward the comic book fans the cinematography although creating discomfort gives the feeling of the graphic artwork coming to life the precision editing creates action and combat scenes that are out of this world pairing this with spectacular stunts and meticulous choreography will catapult graphic novel fans into stratospheric happiness the special effects also are quite mesmerizing as you witness the hyperlapsing metamorphosis of iron mans body armor or a teen tony stark and the zipping and whirring of flying objects its no secret that in general i am not a comic book film fan with a few exceptions conceding this my guess is that captain america civil war will entertain fans of the marvel universe theres plenty of action many of your favorite heroes special effects and innumerable fight scenes fans go see it the rest of us can find better things to do with our time and money

Jun 13 2018,positive, first and foremost lemme talk my shit right now lemme talk that shit on captain america civil war yall out here talkin bout batman has the best movies fuck bruce wayne the silver screen game is steve rogers right now the silver screen game is red white and blue steve rogers out here giving yall hits giving yall more cameos than a wutang album yall bout to give steve the super soldier serum rogers the respeck on his name off the strength ima tell you like it is captain america civil war is the best comic book adaptation of a major comic book event i aint stutter civil war was the comic book event that separated marvel from the pack and flexed how innovative they still were the translation from page to big screen is of course different as the marvel cinematic universe mcu has subtle differences making it an alternative to the marvel616 universe in marvel616 civil war started when a school was blown up during a fight between teen heroes new warriors and some villains in the mcu the event that initiates the divide within the team actually occurs over seas where their help only makes things worse the united nations steps in to put the avengers in check bringing an argument based on a real issue  should superheroes be registered agents of the government thereby being sanctioned and told where to go tony stark robert downey jr believes so adamantly captain america chris evans does not as governments usually have their own agendas and what they deem as right may not necessarily be the right thing the crisis overseas is what gets wakanda involved in this drive towards registration we are introduced to tchalla chadwick boseman this guy is as smooth as tchalla man the homie is confident smooth has the expected generic im from a nonspecific african country accent but his demeanor with it so trill boseman represents tchalla perfectly as the man blessed by bast himself the black panther i dont want to spoil how the winter soldier sebastian comes into play but just know it makes perfect sense and is a deviation from the comic book that you wont mind it further adds to the avengers story line captain america civil war focuses on the approach of superheroes to whats right and whats wrong this movie makes you pick a side because both have very valid points chris evans and rdj do incredible jobs of representing the friendship between captain america and iron man as well as the frustrations between the two steve is a man from the past holding fast to morals and not willing to compromise them when the right thing to do is so blatantly clear tony stark is a futurist thats always adapting with the time and playing the political game in order to keep things together you really feel for both of these characters if youve been privy to the movies before hand you feel it even more as its been a long road headed toward this divide now we got the plot going down emotions are high can we just talk about the action though my god i said good gawd how many movies is black widow scarlett johansson going to have to steal the scene in fight wise before marvel blesses us with a movie of her own black widow is in the streets doing the most yet again as to be expected we see a lot of team work between captain america and bucky which is a throwback to the last captain america movie and their friendship thats for all yall that said it was a weak movie it was a set up damn it plus we got sam wilson anthony mackie taking charge antman paul rudd bringing in the humor and showing us some new tricks and hawkeye jeremy renner with his much needed cynicism there also scarlet witch elizabeth olsen who comes out as the rookie of the year over on starks side he brought the heaviest hitter of them all along in war machine don cheadle along with the vision paul bettany and who am i forgetting hmm oh yeah spider god damn man tom holland lemme tell yall something tom holland is peter parker i dont think yall hear me i said tom holland is peter parker the voice the mannerisms the jokes the movement the reactions everything this kid will remind you of the spiderman cartoon and he sounds just how you would imagine teen peter parker to sound spiderman gets worked in fast but you gotta thank marvel for introducing him off the strength of his name on some yall already know who the fuck he is lets get to the webs on webs on webs already the way the teams interact with one another and against one another is my favorite part of this film anthony mackie really shines as sam wilson the loyal friend and thrower of all the snark when you see him interact with tchalla and winter soldier youre going to instantly be reminded of the friend you have that acts just like sam wilson now i could tell you how baron zemo daniel brühl plays his role very calculated in this movie but its best if i dont brühl does an incredible job of keeping the audience guessing his intentions and displaying his calculated methods i really have to say again this is the best comic book adaptation to film in the game you can complain i know i would about things changed but it truly makes sense for this film civil war really outdid captain america winter soldier but its still a strong film you wonder how they are going to top this one aye man its fucking marvel cinema baby you know theyre going to do it justice imma leave yall with this little hint about the movie get comfortable waiting for the post credit scenes cause you gonna get hit with the most delicious twopiece marvel just needs to give the russo brothers a lifetime contract this movie had so much hype and it exceeded all expectations everyone was on they a plus game this movie was epic
Mar 21 2018,positive,at the heart of captain america civil war is an amazing shapeshifting ability it is a film that confronts the consequences of superheroic intervention while also providing a popcornworthy bangpow experience
Mar 2 2018,positive,there are a lot of superheroes in this they found the right amount of time for each superhero everyone feels right with the amount of time that they are in this moviethis feels like an avengers movie everyone shines in this
Feb 7 2018,positive, eight years ago the arrival of iron man in theaters kickstarted both marvel studios cinematic universe and four years of heated debate regarding the likelihood of marvel  or any studio for that matter  pulling off the sort of ambitious interconnected movie plan the studio had envisioned for its films in the years and films that followed marvel not only proved skeptics wrong but also managed to change the conversation around its films these days its no longer a question of whether marvel can pull it off but how long the studio can keep their wildly successful franchise rolling along if theres an answer to be found in captain america civil war the latest film in the studios cinematic universe and the 13th movie overall its that the marvel movie train isnt showing any signs of slowing down any time soon written by christopher markus and stephen mcfeely and directed by brothers joe and anthony russo the same teams responsible for 2014s captain america the winter soldier captain america civil war has marvels superheroes dealing with the ramifications of their actions throughout all of the previous films and facing the deadly toll that their superpowered battles take on the innocent people around them the avengers soon find their loyalties fractured when the world demands that the team answer to government agencies and the divide grows even greater when a terrorist attack implicates captain americas old friend james bucky barnes  the former assassin known as the winter soldier it almost seems disingenuous to frame civil war as part of the captain america solo franchise more so than any of the previous films in marvels movieverse civil war is an ensemble piece jampacked with just about every costumed character introduced in the studios universe so far with the exception of chris hemsworths thor and mark ruffalos hulk and masterfully balancing out their screen time so no one feels neglected sure the philosophical war at the heart of civil war is primarily waged between chris evans soldierturnedsuperhero steve rogers aka captain america and robert downey jrs playboy industrialist tony stark iron man but nearly everyone seems to have their own unique perspective on both whats at stake and the best way to handle it to its credit theres actually a surprising amount of depth in the supporting characters of civil war and what could easily have been a film in which characters get smashed together under weak pretenses a la batman v superman dawn of justice ends up being a remarkably nuanced presentation of some complicated perspectives on personal accountability collateral damage and the balance between freedom and security both evans and downey articulate their  positions well  possibly even better than their characters did in the civil war comic book series that inspired the film  and most of the supporting characters who ally themselves with one hero or the other offer up some convincing arguments for doing so each of the primary teamup films in marvels cinematic universe so far have raised the bar when it comes to ensemble action sequences from the novelty of seeing them interact in the avengers to the impressive coordination of their efforts in films like the winter soldier and last years avengers age of ultron the same holds true for civil war which boasts some of the best visually thrilling chase and fightsequences of any film produced by marvel so far where age of ultron upped the ante when it came to the scale of the ensemble sequences and how much cooperative choreography it asked of its hero characters civil war takes things to the next level by relying on scenes in which the characters battle each other instead of hordes of digitally created robot villains given the characters powers those battles unfold in the air and on the ground and occasionally at a miniature level frequently shifting between both environments on the fly pun totally intended and transitioning certain matchups from the background to the foreground as the characters trade off opponents the end result is a wildly entertaining celebration of both hyperdetailed fight choreography and the creative teams deep understanding of the characters and the unique ways each character moves and acts among the returning cast for the film are the aforementioned evans and downey as well as much of the cast from both age of ultron and the winter soldier paul rudds antman character scott lang is also thrown into the mix while thats all well and good and rudd is particularly good in the role he plays its the newcomers to the franchise that have been generating the lions share of buzz leading up to the films release  and they more than live up to the hype in his debut as the new spiderman actor tom holland hits all the right notes and plays off downey and the rest of the cast well tonally he captures the best parts of former spiderman actor andrew garfields underappreciated portrayal of the character offering an endless commentary on everything happening around him and bringing a lighthearted tone to the scenes he appears in the transition into marvels cinematic universe appears to have been a smooth one for the famous webslinger and his surprisingly ample amount of screen time should leave fans feeling good about his future at marvel theres also a lot to like about 42 actor chadwick bosemans introduction as black panther the popular african superhero over the course of civil war although the title of the film suggests that its captain americas movie bosemans black panther and scarlett johanssons spy superhero natasha romanoff aka black widow seem positioned to be the moral centers of the narrative both johansson and boseman do a nice job of conveying their respective characters uncertainty about the events transpiring around them and the opposing rigid positions taken by each sides leader its an interesting  and clever  juxtaposition with black panther offering an outsiders perspective while black widow is too deeply entrenched to fully commit to either side its a difference that both actors seem well aware of in their performances and adds another layer to the story being told in the film as the first installment in phase three of marvels cinematic universe captain america civil war does an excellent job of establishing a new status quo for the avengers and the world they inhabit and leaves the audience craving more without relying on a cliffhanger its not an easy feat and the film succeeds where so many other projects envisioned as chapters in a larger overarching story fall short at a time when the failings of batman v superman seem to have opened the door once again to discussion of superhero fatigue captain america civil war offers a strong argument that the best is yet to come in the superhero movie genre zack snyders rebel moon has hit netflix this week and people are already making comparisons between it and other

Jan 24 2018,positive,the new characters totally live up to their new expectationsprobably the best live action spiderman i have ever seen
Dec 5 2017,positive, directed by joe russo  anthony russo starring chris evans robert downey jr scarlett johansson sebastian stan anthony mackie don cheadle elizabeth olsen paul rudd jeremy renner william hurt emily vancamp tom holland martin freeman chadwick boseman daniel brühl paul bettany marissa tomei john kani john slattery hope davis frank grillo and stan lee captain america civil war isnt perfect and may have an overstuffed narrative but your satisfaction detector is beyond busted if you arent having fun with this supersized latest entry into the marvel cinematic universe by the time the opposing teams of captain america and iron man race towards each other full speed at an airfield hangar with the sole intention of kicking each others asses thats the exact moment you can pinpoint that this movie is everything a superhero blockbuster should be and more this movie right here is the perfect example of why everyone from young children to teenagers to adults and even old people willingly choose to spend hot summer days inside of a dark room with images being projected onto a screen captain america civil war is the ultimate hollywood blockbuster taking a dozen superheroes and giving them all highlighted moments in bombastic creative action sequences isnt the only reason i am gushing over what anthony and joe russo have brought to the table this is their followup to 2014s highly excellent captain america the winter soldier but how the teams are established and the fact that everyone has a pretty good reason for choosing whichever side they prefer elizabeth olsen returns playing scarlet witch and even with limited screen time she has an arc written that sees her character going somewhere its a testament to their talent that the russo brothers went in with a clear plan of how to juggle a whopping amount of beloved heroes and heroines the movie is chaos but its controlled chaos it is the new characters that steal captain america civil war though specifically speaking tom hollands fresh rendition of spiderman not only is the actor actually a teenager this time around but holland also excels at delivering quips midfight and generally being amusing while also showcasing the kids typical awkward personality and chadwick bosemans black panther who essentially plays both sides in the growing conflict for his own personal reasons most importantly the crucial reason that these characters are considered a massive success is that people will be salivating for their upcoming solo movies by the time the civil war credits roll both have fully intriguing personalities to explore while also being responsible for some of the most memorable pieces of action found within the whole movie not to say that captain america civil war is a major success because of one scene but its hard to imagine anyone not wanting to revisit that airfield spectacle it is like someone taking your inner childs affection for superheroes battling each other and realizing it on screen with utter perfection going into captain america civil war the consensus seemed to be that because the central focus of the movie would be spent exploring the conflict of captain america and iron man unable to come to an agreement on how the government should oversee their actions with some winter soldier drama for good measure all of the secondary characters would be wasted afterthoughts not necessarily adding much to the plot this is still true to some degree but nowhere near as bad as some may have anticipated when it comes down to it captain america civil war will be remembered for being a movie that really doesnt solve much but rather is just one big excuse to create as many superhero dream battles as possible thats not to say the movie isnt well written because it is and i will get to that but that the pure satisfaction that comes from seeing a hilariously awesome sequence such as antman shrinking himself to tinker around inside iron mans suit are moments that comic book and movie fans alike have dreamed of at the very inception of the marvel cinematic universe there is a villain outside of captain america and iron man i suppose that technically the one you disagree with could be viewed as an antagonist but i actually think the less said about him is to the benefit of anyone reading this review he knows how to pull the strings of both captain america and iron man turning them against each other but his motives are surprisingly compelling making him more than your generic disposable marvel villain that is hellbent on taking over the world because apparently the villain 101 guidebook says thats what youre supposed to do there are red herrings and much more going on then what initially appears on the surface with daniel bruhl obviously being a fantastic actor managing to make a despicable human being somewhat empathetic in a strange way the only real problems with captain america civil war come from the first hour occasionally getting lost transitioning from scene to scene without spoiling too much theres a funeral scene towards the beginning that just kind of happens very quickly not really leaving a lasting impression due to how sudden it arises its the kind of plot point that feels like it should be explored in a more selfcontained captain america flick not something that is essentially avengers 25 the same also applies for captain america basically getting a new girlfriend the movie is called captain america civil war and captain america might be the most poorly written thing about it how is that for irony random plot points aside its at least understandable why both captain america and iron man take up the stances they choose to vehemently fight for the core of the narrative is well written enough to the point where neither superhero is necessarily wrong if anything you will probably flipflop whose side you are on a few times throughout the movie and for everyone that cant take a position they still get to chew on some very interesting themes exploring the consequences of every action and whatever the reaction may be its really a movie about cause and effect but with lots and lots of explosions and people in suits using their own unique abilities to smack each other around as a quick side note no one character fights the same ensuring that all of the battles feel refreshing a lot could have went wrong with captain america civil war some actually did considering the first hour is a bit shaky with the actual ending leaving something to be desired but once the teams are assembled the movie falls into a groove the action quickly becomes the most impressive we have seen in a film from the marvel cinematic universe while also trekking down some unpredictable emotional beats that fill out the extravaganza as the total blockbuster package if we can continue to get movies as good as captain america civil war comic book adaptations are not a bubble about to burst were entering a golden age where everything is firing on all cylinders
Nov 16 2017,positive, with captain america civil war the marvel miniseries that had huge ramifications across the universe finally comes to the big screen however its not quite the same as the original comic book series given that fox owns the rights to xmen and fantastic four that said its still a really awesome film just as in the comics steve rogers captain america chris evans is pitted against tony starks iron man robert downey jr  cap is backed by sam wilson anthony mackie bucky barnes sebastian stan hawkeye jeremy renner antman paul rudd and scarlet witch elizabeth olsen  tony is joined by black widow scarlet johansson war machine don cheadle vision paul bettany and black panther chadwick boseman following tony stark tom holland  stark also has one peter parker up his sleeve as spiderman finally joins the marvel cinematic universe the stamford incident in the comics is replaced by an incident in lagos  the scarlet witch uses her telekinesis to prevent a bomb from going off  she ends up killing hundreds of people in the process  unfortunately she was unable to prevent the blast from destroying a building  this soon leads to the united nations passing the sokovia accords  the only question is just how many avengers will sign on and abide by the accords meanwhile at a conference to ratify the accords in vienna someone that appears to look like bucky barnes lets off a bomb that kills wakandan king tchaka his son tchalla boseman vows to kill the person responsible unfortunately for him its the wrong person as bucky was framed by helmet zero daniel brühl who used to work for sokovian intelligence  some sokovians dont forget what happened some time prior when the avengers faced off against ultron what we know during the end of the movie cap breaks his team out of the raft prison and mails a phone to tony stark delivered by the great stan lee  black widow is in hiding  bucky goes into stasis at a facility in wakanda  james rhodes is paralyzed but tony provides him with braces that allow him to walk again  thor and hulk are not in the movie as the next thor movie is said to be taking place around the same time and mostly in the cosmos that being said the events of this movie will impact the marvel cinematic universe for years to come there are a lot of players in captain america civil war but it never really feels like its too crowded its just crowded enough to be an enjoyable film danielle solzman is native of louisville ky and holds a ba in public relations from northern kentucky university and a ma in media communications from webster university she roots for her beloved kentucky wildcats st louis cardinals indianapolis colts and boston celtics living less than a mile away from wrigley field in chicago she is an active reader sportsentertainmenthistorybiographiesselect fiction and involved with the chicago improv scene she also sees many movies and reviews them she has previously written for redbird rants wildcat blue nation and hidden remoteflicksided from april 2016 through may 2017 her film reviews can be found on creators
Nov 5 2017,positive, well kids with the release of captain america civil war were officially soaking in the marvel cinematic universes phase three  and boy do directors joe and anthony russo open the third block of superhero films in a killer kickass fashion just like their previous film captain america the winter soldier the brothers give ethical conflicts just as much pathos as the calibrated action while its immensely entertaining and has a biting sense of humor to boot the film feels more like an avengers series film than a standalone cap pic the spoilerfree plot our favorite band of tightknit heroes is divided over the sokovia accords a peace treaty government action that puts the avengers under the command of all nations half the squad sides with iron man tony stark robert downey jr in begrudgingly accepting the new checks on their considerable power teamironman includes james rhodes war machine don cheadle vision paul bettany and black widow scarlett johansson the other half led by captain america steve rogers chris evans is determined to retain the groups independence those teamcap dissenters include sam wilson falcon anthony mackie wanda maximoff scarlet witch elizabeth olsen and clint barton hawkeye jeremy renner the latter group is forced to go rogue to combat an emerging threat brought on by caps bestie bucky barnes the winter soldier sebastian stan and a mysterious baddie daniel brühl its sort of funny that civil war is the second film this year about the fallout caused by the collateral damage from superhero battles after batman v superman dawn of justice the marvel entry is far better but still its almost as if dc and marvel both read the same nerdblogger think piece and decided to address said moral ethical conundrums however this is a conceit forged from the comics the ship er helicarrier has been headed in that direction the entire time        unlike the prior avengers film we saw last summer new characters and their backgrounds are worked in far more effortlessly than ultrons hamhanded kitchen sink approach there are no tangential storylines or overarching lore like those stupid infinity stones clumsily shoehorned into the narrative thats not to say theres not a lot going on there is and it can be a wee bit difficult to track it all we get to take our time with meow tchalla black panther chadwick boseman and peter parker spidermans tom holland introductions panthers arc got me revved up to see what his standalone film will entail this spiderman is guaranteed to wash out the bad taste in your mouth from the amazing spiderman series baddie bruhl proves to be a formidable foe even in a smaller role crossbones frank grillo impresses plus its wonderful to see another strong female character further develop her own voice  in this case sharon carter emily van camp perhaps the best most memorable part of the film comes late in the second act  and its where the movie really takes flight marvel superfan or not i dare you not to have a slaphappy look on your face during the abandoned airport sequence where all the superheroes whose dividing line is literally scorched into the earth earning an oh honey for nonsubtlety face off against each other its the best use of wellestablished characters blending with the new crew and its freaking awesome the russos capture the mounting action character development and humor in a coherent way particularly well here otherwise the chase through the marketplace looks like bourne generic shakeycam as does the hypercranked quality in the almost hitchcockianinspired parkourinfused reverse raid sequence with cap in buckys bucharest hovel it might be too soon to tell but i think marvels third phase has already corrected itself on using death and reincarnation as dramatic devices it seems to break the rules to make up new ones  and im more than okay with a little shakeup of their formula
Oct 24 2017,negative, two years ago anthony and joe russo were responsible for what  for my money  is one of the best superhero films ever made  captain america the winter soldier was a fivestar delight from beginning to end with a clever script a neat line in repartee and a nearperfect mix of oldfashioned stunt work and seamlesslooking cgi captain america civil war is very much a sequel to winter soldier but regrettably too long tryingly complicated and it takes the best part of 75 minutes before it breaks into anything resembling comic exuberance apparently she and tony stark  aka iron man  are currently on a break a fact that reduces the potential for sexual undercurrents by about 90 per cent despite the presence of both scarlett johansson  back as natasha romanoffblack widow  and emily vancamp after a heavy hint that the winter soldier is still alive we catch up with chris evans as steve rogers the once cryogenically suspended captain america plus a hefty slice of the avengers gang as they battle a terrorist attack on a bioresearch lab in lagos of course  after a lengthy and moderately spectacular battle  they prevail but in the process are accidentally responsible for a great many innocent deaths  secretary of state thaddeus ross  played with sinister relish by william hurt  believes the avengers have gone from being guardians of the world to vigilantes he wants them under the control of the un which becomes a lot more complicated after a special session of the un in vienna is devastated by a huge explosion cctv captures a grainy picture of the man responsible yes it seems the winter soldier  who those paying attention will know was once rogers former wartime buddy bucky barnes until hydra got their deadly hands on him  really is alive that being that the avengers disagree on whether they should be under un control iron man  perhaps aware of what a mess he made of things in avengers age of ultron  thinks they should which is why its such a relief when stark jets off to queens to find a teenage peter parker spiderman graces an avengers film for the first time oh the excitement and the captain recruits arguably the silliest character in the marvel universe the pintsized antman paul rudd  captain america was created in 1940 by artists joe simon and jack kirby who wanted to encourage the us to enter ww2 he was portrayed punching hitler on the cover of the first issue  at last some real comicbook fun at last some real spectacle until at least it all gets a bit supersized and silly at an airport one of the slightly unfair problems civil war faces is that the russos raised the bar so high last time that whatever follows had to disappoint  most of the vital humour arrives dangerously late courtesy of the overdelayed arrival of spidey nicely underplayed by young brit tom holland and antman while in the absence of the lovely pepper efforts to introduce some hints of romantic and sexual tension are hampered by the fact that johansson seems to have run out of superheroes with whom to flirt lets hope the next round of avengers films  the infinity wars movies are due out in 2018 and 2019  are better than this son of saul 15  which won the 2016 oscar for best film in a foreign language will be one of the most powerful and harrowing films youll see all year set amid the horrors of auschwitz in 1944 and directed by the hungarian filmmaker laszlo nemes its the story of saul a hungarian jew forced to become a member of the socalled sonderkommando  its members prisoners themselves were forced to work for their nazi captors for a few short months herding new arrivals to the gas chambers stripping them of their belongings valuables and jewellery and dragging away the pieces as the dead bodies are known before being executed themselves saul who witnesses the killing has already decided that the boy is his son  rightly or wrongly its never made clear  and determines that his body will be buried according to jewish tradition  however saul played here with an unflagging intensity by geza rohrig  will not be swayed regardless of the cost to himself or indeed to his doomed fellow prisoners from the moment saul stumbles out of a blurry background into what feels like the sharpest focus youve ever seen the appalling horrors of the concentration camp are either just out of focus or just out of shot  the multilayered sound design by tamas zanyi is outstanding too  at times powerfully bringing to life atrocities that we cant see at others adding to the atmosphere of horror demolition 15  is a strange film about grief directed by jeanmarc vallée director of dallas buyers club and starring jake gyllenhaal as davis a new york investment banker grieving for his wife who died in a car crash  diy sos presenter nick knowles is the unexpected force behind golden years 12a  a wouldbe ealingstyle comedy about an elderly bristol couple bernard hill and virginia mckenna who when faced with mounting pension problems decide to take up bank robbery and prove surprisingly successful at it its a lovely idea but the execution falls short on every count hampered by some strange casting hill is only 71 while mckenna is 84 some seriously misfiring comedy and a screenplay  cowritten by knowles  that suggests on this evidence that he should stick to the day job
Oct 16 2017,positive,good luck picking a favorite fight because every action scene is incredible
Sep 20 2017,positive, after last years bloated and dull avengers age of ultron along with the fun but unessential antman one could be forgiven for thinking the wheels were close to falling off the marvel wagon well anthony and joe russo the same guys that made 2014s captain america winter soldier one of the smartest superhero flicks are back  and they have improved on the formula in this the united nations want to take over the avengers too many innocent people have died in the course of them saving the day tony stark aka iron man is all for having accountability steve rogers aka captain america sees it as a leash the issue breaks up the band a bit of a nobrainer to say this is better than batman v superman dawn of yawn but the plots are cut from similar cloth  aside from having two big name heroes duke it out that is writ big here you defeat the bad guy but did you really save the day if a building fell on top of a crowd not that anyone was hoping for this to fail outside of the dc comics crew but considering how many characters are involved the huge fights plus the need to introduce black panther and spiderman this romps along the only character that is an odd is paul bettanys vision the bright red guy in green may work in comics  or could work with guardians of the galaxy  but here hey marvel are you totally committed to the idea of bumbly cumberpatchs dr strange it feels like an unnecessary diversion after civil war really 2017s spiderman film cannot arrive soon enough if you thought hes just a cameo here think again you get a lot of web for your buck plus a very smart workaround to avoid yet another origin story welcome tom holland  possibly already the best cinema spiderman yet and we have to wait until 2018 for black panther chadwick boseman is so definite in the role youd think its his third sequel that we have to wait that long for his first solo adventure just feels mean this could be the most serious of all marvels films to date yet  and this is where zack snyder may want to pay attention  it isnt without humour despite this being the film where the cost of heroics in ordinary lives is brought to bear on our heroes it remembers that they are human too its also interesting that the fear factor here is not that its the end of the world to quote every mother when the kids are playing up  if they dont behave someones going to get hurt this must be a rare case of the men serving as eyecandy more than the women and theres no more a humbling sight for the average bloke than chris evans in his basic grey tshirt there are some highly gratuitous scenes of the gun show on display with some very blatant flexing going on in a struggle with a helicopter then again if youve got them flaunt them but for every other guy you may hear the dumbbells calling sure choose teamcap or teamironman we are firmly teamrusso so far out of 13 movies they are the only directors that are two for two jon favreau stumbled and stepped out after iron man 2 joss whedon  the king of the ensemble  fell at the hands of ultron and studio heads according to him only the russo brothers have knocked it out of the park twice this is the film with everything great then that they are back in 2018 for avengers infinity war  though given how grounded civil war is it will be interesting to see how they manage with more fantastical fare
Sep 12 2017,positive, truth be told we should have seen this coming forget the fact that in the comic book universe marvel had already given readers a grand civil war event crossing over damn near every superhero title in their brand with captain america as the heart and soul of the conflict pitting him against his chief rival and avengers cofounder iron man in that vast graphic landscape complete with seemingly endless characters the stakes had an undeniably personal dimension it was a battle over identity  secret identities  which if you think about it verges on a question of civil rights and civil liberties as a hero should you be forced to register with the government placing those you hold dear at risk simply because every crackpot with a beef against you would now have access to your family and friends at any time the books with the full complement of characters unbroken by the corporate interests seen on the film side also had equally fracturing concerns over mutant registration too in the evolving cinematic universe and in the morethancapable hands of directors anthony and joe russo returning after their triumphant debut with captain america the winter soldier marvel works under several constraints that would seem to hinder the impact of this bigscreen version of the civil war storyline but all is not lost because despite not having access to mutants in this realm and the decadeslong history of the print narratives the central figures remain on each side and they are no less compelling here than in those handdrawn frames captain america chris evans aka steve rogers is the endearing and enduring symbol of liberty weve come to love hes a great white savior who again due to a tragic twist of fate became a man out of time frozen in ice and thawed out decades in the future  a strange and quite brave new world with technology shadowy bureaucracies and a growing collection of villains staging a new assault on freedom and justice able assistance arrives in the form of tony stark robert downey jr the son of a brilliant scientist and compatriot of captain americas from back in the day but much like his father the younger stark proves to be a bit of a wild card the flamboyantly wealthy playboy with the ability to create such destructive toys fashioned himself as the ultimate deterrent to war thanks to his iron man armor which he believed only he should control that is until personal guilt and greater authoritative forces convinced him that some oversight might be necessary but who should watch over the emerging gammamad brutes the alien gods the nevermiss sharpshooters the iron men and the highflying birds of prey so caught up in the corporate branding of phases developing storylines into the foreseeable future and managing multiple distribution formats marvel has somehow been able to maintain a strong focus on the characters and the interpersonal interactions between them in order to create a sense of camaraderie and the inevitable tension that fuels the fire in an explosive civil war civil war the third installment in the ongoing saga of steve rogers continues the fascinating narrative of the most fully realized character in the marvel cinematic universe from his nostalgicallyrendered origin and the slambam espionage tale in winter soldier to the superherostuffed sandwich that is civil war rogers and his bedrock relationship with his best friend bucky sebastian stan has served as the moral compass everpointing to true north all of the old avengers standbys are here except thor chris hemsworth hulk mark ruffalo and antman paul rudd and theres the embarrassment of riches with the inclusion of the new spiderman tom holland and black panther chadwick boseman each of whom get more than enough opportunity to shine but in a movie packed to the gills with heroes civil war never loses track of the fact that it is a captain america story the love loss and life of steve rogers ground every scene there is an intimacy here that does not exist in the avengers movies
Aug 25 2017,negative,actually instead of captain america civil war a more appropriate title might be captain america cap and iron man get their iddybiddy feewings hurt
Aug 17 2017,positive,emotionally satisfying in a way that most other mcu movies can only dream of being
Aug 14 2017,positive,captain america civil war is a movie about faith  in each other in leaders in an ethos  in a universe that is becoming increasingly secular
Aug 3 2017,positive, so says iron man aka tony stark in captain america civil war perhaps one of the most politically nuanced films ever released as a tentpole in a blockbuster franchise this is a movie with a distinct social message one that merits detailed analysis but in order for that to happen ill need to give away key plot points from the film as a result major spoilers follow this paragraph back to stark captain america civil war tells the story of an international agreement known as the sokovia accords that requires superheroes to register with the government and operate only when and if a united nations panel deems it necessary captain america aka steve rogers immediately opposes this on the grounds that it violates their civil liberties while iron man supports it because he believes that as another character puts it victory at the expense of the innocent is no victory at all because superheroes often cause significant loss of life and property the argument for accountability makes a great deal of sense  indeed its practically selfevident yet by the end of captain america civil war the plot has decisively sided with captain america and forced iron man to come around to his position  in this writers opinion incorrectly so this isnt to say that captain america civil war is a bad film very much to the contrary it is one of the best movies to ever come out of the marvel cinematic universe balancing engaging action set pieces and witty dialogue with intelligent character studies and ethical debates due to its political content and numerous superhero characters it invites comparison to batman v superman dawn of justice particularly when the latter discussed how in a democracy good is a conversation not a unilateral decision unlike bvs however the new captain america is wellwritten and a lot of fun which makes it much easier to recommend to casual moviegoing audiences it also does a commendable job of giving iron mans point of view a fair shake at one point the android vision who sides with iron man rebuts captain america by pointing out that our very strength invites challenge challenge incites conflict and conflict breeds catastrophe supervision is not something to be dismissed out of hand whats more there is an unavoidable democratic logic to the sokovia accords which is based on the premise that superheroes must be held to the same legal standards as nonsuperpowered human beings there are unsettling realworld implications to arguing that super people should be allowed to change the world as they see fit without being accountable for the harm caused by their actions even if said harm is unintentional such as when we see scarlet witch accidentally blow up a building in nigeria when captain america insists that i know were not perfect but the safest hands are still our own he actually flies in the face of the spirit of democracy subordinating the will of the people to a belief in his own superior virtue nevertheless the movie winds up siding with him and not only because his name is in the title obviously the superhero genre itself cant exist if its characters are forced to report to the government like glorified police officers so there are practical reasons for the marvel movies to maintain a comparatively anarchic universe on a more profound level though captain america civil war is the product of a culture that has been given excellent reasons to distrust state authority once the government gains power over superheroes it quickly deprives them of their civil liberties denying the arrested superheroes legal counsel interning scarlet witch without trial and ordering the assassination of a character the winter soldier whose innocence would save his life if only his civil liberties were being respected even when the government acts justly  such as when we see it imprison falcon hawkeye ant man and scarlet witch all of whom are undoubtedly guilty of breaking the law  its still discomfiting to see this in action we know these characters we like them and we recognize their good intentions so its painful to see them treated like criminals instead of heroes nevertheless if they existed in the real world they would be criminals so when iron man switches his views after seeing them incarcerated the change of heart seems shortsighted rather than noble its understandable why he would feel sympathy for his friends of course but by opposing government oversight simply because he feels badly for them he forgets that just because he knows them and the audience in a sense knows them doesnt mean that the billions of denizens in the marvel cinematic universe know them on the same personal level they are and remain unelected and unaccountable  and thanks to iron mans assistance in helping them escape at the end remain that way its worth noting that when i saw this movie with my friends two of us wound up getting involved in a heated debate on its political message immediately after the screening one of them firmly sided with captain america and the other had a decidedly mixed view on the films political subtext but both had deep reservations about the amount of power exercised by the state in this film my theory is that because our generation has seen our government violate individual liberties on a regular basis from the war on drugs and nsa spying to law enforcement persecution of racial minorities there is an instinctive distrust of state authority that is entirely reasonable when my friends adam and jorge identify with captain americas rhetoric on individual rights being the foundation of true justice theyre applying lessons that we have far too often seen be disregarded with terrible consequences it is entirely possible for intelligent and wellintentioned individuals to see the world the way that captain america does here the regrettable thing about captain america civil war is that instead of allowing iron man to remain resolute in his convictions as well it forces him to give way so that the plot can move forward while our world doesnt have superhumans it has many individuals who wield disproportionate power over the rest of us because of unearned privileges  wealth or being part of an empowered racial or gender group for example if we are going to create a free and just world these concentrations of social and economic power need to be confronted and remedied and just as a captain america must exist to remind us that their individual rights matter too so too is an iron man required to remind us that the freedom of the whole is infringed when the few can make themselves unaccountable to the rest if captain america civil war had been a truly insightful movie it would have aimed to strike a balance between both of these perspectives by ultimately siding with captain america over iron man it implicitly delegitimizes a valid and important perspective matthew rozsa is a staff writer at

Jun 26 2017,positive, as any marvels avengers appreciator can tell you a staple focus of each story is on team dynamics what does it take for a group of people with different agendas and backgrounds to effectively work together for good how does a team find common ground and account for each others strengths and weaknesses as anyone whos lived in christian community or worked in social justice knows these ideas come up as much in everyday life as they do when taking down a supervillain but what marvel hasnt looked at is the other side of intentional community  what happens when a team cant work the latest marvel release captain america civil war digs into these important questions what does it take to break up a team and what does the fallout look like civil war s conflict begins when tony stark robert downey jr aka iron man puts his support behind the sokovia accords a document created in response to the destruction at the end of avengers age of ultron the accords would place the avengers under the jurisdiction of the united nations putting them in combat only when the un deems it necessary the avengers who sign on will continue as part of the team the ones who dont will be forced into retirement predictably some of the avengers agree with stark believing the teams actions shouldnt be allowed to go unchecked others believe that this compromise is the only way theyll be able to continue doing meaningful work but a few particularly steve rogers chris evans aka captain america refuse to sign believing the best way to do their job is by putting faith in each other not institutions matters get complicated when a bomb goes off at the official signing of the accords killing several people blame for the incident falls on bucky barnes sebastian stan caps former best friend whos recovering from his stint as the brainwashed human weapon winter soldier already on starks bad side captain america and his allies battle with stark and the other avengers to protect bucky who they believe is innocent fortunately civil war is not the same painful nihilistic slog that this springs other superhero smackdown batman v superman dawn of justice was unlike zack snyders debacle civil war directors joe and anthony russo understand how to successfully portray the difference of beliefs that lead to the films big fight we know why iron man and captain america each feel the way they do  and crucially the film never positions either of them as clearly right or wrong of course civil war is also really fun it includes incredible action sequences and its stars have natural chemistry the addition of two new heroes to the ranks chadwick bosemans great black panther and tom hollands adorably dorky spiderman is exciting as is the return of paul rudd as the smartmouthed scrappy antman but its the balance of conflict at its core and the films willingness to expose and explore the deeprooted feelings of its characters that makes captain america civil war such a success just like us earths mightiest heroes disagree and get their feelings hurt sometimes but like any relationship worth saving we know theyll be reconciled whether youre battling mass incarceration or alien invaders fighting for the common good also means caring about the people fighting by your side we value your feedback on the articles we post please fill out the form below and a member of our online publication team will receive your message by submitting this form you consent to your comment being featured in our letters section   please do not include any nontext characters such as emojis or other nonstandard content into your submission  it may cause errors in submitting the form  thanks
Jun 1 2017,positive, more so than any other superhero movie captain america civil war prosecutes the very men and women were supposed to be grateful for it demands that these heroes take a look at the devastation theyve caused around the world face their guilt and admit that their existence may be more problematic for humanity than beneficial the movie is not a celebration of the superhero squad but a condemnation if the avengers was our introduction to what the team could do to protect their home from otherworldly threats civil war is the chilling reminder of the devastation and calamity that also comes with it in many ways civil war is marvels darkest and heaviest movie to date but thats part of what makes it the studios best after close to a decade of watching these heroes come into their own flying around earth and transporting themselves to different universes civil war is the first truly human movie about a team of superhuman individuals while civil war does present an actual villain for the team to take down the biggest battle in the movie is with each other over the level of freedom they have its not a question of physically taking that political freedom away but a moral dilemma over whether theyve abused their privileges and whether or not its time to admit that they might be causing more harm than good to the very population they swore to protect to be a superhero things must be sacrificed personal relationships a chance at a normal life or even just being able to take a vacation existing as an extraordinary being means giving up the ordinary aspects of life that many of us take for granted the tradeoff for living an isolating and burdenfilled life that comes with being a superhero is the protection and survival of the place they call home when theyre faced with the reality of the consequences of their actions however they begin to question everything they thought they knew its that internal struggle that eventually leads to the grand battle between themselves where the movie finds its heart despite the heaviness of the movie however the trademark humor and banter between the characters is still very much present throughout the film their obvious love for each other as a family of misfits bound together by their superhuman abilities just adds to the heartbreaking dissolution of their trust and kinship with each other captain america civil war is without question the best movie to come out of marvel studios in the past eight years and its hard to see how theyll top it going forward quasibased on the 2006 marvel comics crossover event of the same name theres a couple of different story arcs happening in civil war theres the continuation of bucky barnes also known as the winter solider complicated relationship with former best friend steve rogers aka captain america theres a new threat being posed to the avengers and in turn the rest of humanity by an unknown villain but the biggest storyline by far is the battle between captain america and iron man over whether or not to sign the sokovia accord similar to the superhuman registration act in mark millars comic the sokovia accord is a legally binding contract that would force the various superheroes around the world to operate as a branch of the united nations instead of being able to fly into any country they like attempting to take out dangerous men and women they would need proper clearance from the un as a ways of respecting and honoring the rules of sovereign states on one side of the debate over whether to sign the accord or not is tony stark iron man who after a particularly emotional conversation argues that having a thirdparty voice give their take on a dangerous situation could be beneficial its a thought echoed by vision paul bettany who preaches that in order to gain the respect and trust of normal people they must work with the agencies that those people have elected on the other side is rogers who stubbornly refuses to sign the accord in his opinion having their freedom taken away from them would lead to other sections of their lives being compromised like their right to privacy in his opinion signing the accord is fundamentally wrong and considering the tangled web his best friend bucky is caught up in he and tony realize they cant agree on what the best option is for the future of their team civil war feels like a political thriller full of espionage backstabbing and above all else rigid drama anthony and joe russo the directors behind the film know how to make something as dull as a team meeting over whether they should sign a contract immensely fascinating and emotionally draining every time these team members interact with each other theres an enormous amount of emotion behind their conversations while the action hasnt been sacrificed  there is an amazing chase scene that particularly stands out  its clear that the russo brothers dont need to rely on it the movie marks peter parkers debut in the cinematic universe and while the character has begun to feel played out tom hollands portrayal may be the best version yet tobey maguire and andrew garfield attempted to play a young nerdy peter parker and while they werent terrible in the roles there was something inauthentic about their portrayals holland on the other hand looks and sounds like a teenager the actor whos 19 in real life looks like hes in his freshman year of high school and theres a sensitive side to his take on the character that maguire and garfield never fully captured even more importantly however is how great his chemistry is with robert downey jr iron man is the superhero that parker most resonates with and as a result the two of them have the most interaction in the movie it was crucial that the two were able to pull off the mentorship vibe that marvel is obviously going for and they surpass all expectation hollands peter parker feels like the spiderman iteration that weve all been waiting for instead the russo brothers who understand how to properly use an ensemble cast as big as the one in civl war use the action sequences sparingly its clear the focus is on the moral dilemma and ethical drama thats been brewing since the last captain america movie winter soldier and on the growing distrust rogers has for the government the captain america series has always felt like the maturest of all the marvel properties and civil war is the defining moment of that maturity as marvel starts a new phase in its cinematic universe theres a shift in tone from the films that started it all in 2008 as its fans have grown so has the studio and after spending nearly a decade getting to know these characters civil war is the near perfect result of what can be accomplished if you can create a universe that people deeply invest themselves in this movie couldnt have worked before now because there wasnt enough reason to care that tony stark and steve rogers were going to fight over this type of issue we know these characters now however and their grievances with each other watching them beat each other to a bloody pulp is overwhelmingly afflicting the russo brothers understand how important the family dynamic is to this storyline and they not only manage to portray that in this film but use just enough personal banter on top of the intense drama to remind us that regardless of past arguments theyve always been a strong unit as a result everything that happens between the superhero collective becomes more devastating despite all the heaviness surrounding the movie those looking for a classic marvel experience wont be disappointed especially if youre banking on seeing some pretty incredible fight choreography its hard to talk about just how fantastic the fight scenes in civil war are compared to some of the bigger parts of the avengers movies without giving too much away so ill try to remain as vague as possible for those who dont want to know too much about it the fight scenes in civil war are broken down into a couple of different sections theres introductory fights new character dislikes another character and the two fight personal fights bucky taking on steve or tony taking on steve for example and then there are the blockbuster stylized fights which is essentially the team battles each type of fight has its own quirk but youre never bored by what youre seeing on screen sometimes fight choreography can get repetitive and monotonous theres only so many ways you can punch someone in the face after all but the russo brothers inject their own personality into each scene and the fights switch from rapidly placed punches and kicks to slowed down meticulous blows in many ways each sequence feels tailored made for each character and its an element of the movie that i particularly enjoyed fans of millars original series will also be happy to know that there are panels from the comic that make it into the film specifically during the fight scenes while civil war doesnt follow millars book directly there are certainly similar themes and events that present themselves throughout the movie and its clear that the russo brothers dug deep to find ways to honor his story as best as they could bettany downey jr paul rudd antman tom holland spiderman and anthony mackie falcon steal the show in that regard and provide the perfect amount of comic relief for a movie this tense the cathartic moments that appear in the movie although few and far between considering just how much is happening usually revolves around these characters and because of that they are utterly crucial the use of comedy as a major incentive to love these characters has always worked for marvel and i was concerned going into civil war that the comedic aspects would be sacrificed in order to tackle all the story arcs that had to be included its definitely there though and despite the movie dealing with pretty serious issues the guilt of its characters and the questionable future ahead it remains a fun watch this was the avengers movie that we were all waiting on this feels like the ultimate ensemble superhero movie and im worried that the more they try to pack into twoandahalf hours the less well get out of it if marvel can find a way to replicate this exact formula and use it for the rest of their big flagship films though its a universe ill never get tired of i went into civil war expecting a runofthemill marvel movie i left feeling more excited about the countless possibilities the studio has going forward and thats something i didnt think i would get back after the avengers
May 10 2017,positive, i have had my feet firmly planted in team cap ever since i heard that there would be a civil war film the captain america films have by far and away been my favourite superhero movies of recent times they are wordy tense noirlike and  lets be honest  they have chris evans bursting out of every tshirt he owns hey im only human so the premise of civil war is simple choose a side team cap or team iron man with a couple of disasters notched up the avengers are under intense political scrutiny the us government wants the assembled team of avengers to sign a bill stating that they will ultimately become accountable for their own actions this causes division within the team captain america chris evans believes superheroes should remain free to defend humanity without government interference iron man robert downey jr sharply disagrees and supports oversight as the debate escalates into a proper feud the rest of the superheroes must decide where their loyalties lie directors the russo brothers  the team behind captain america the winter soldier  have proved something almighty with their last two cinematic offerings superhero movies do not need to be dumbed down they do not need to be action heavy to be entertaining they can be quickwitted and dialogue heavy without feeling drawn out or glib thats not to say there isnt plenty of action in this latest marvel instalment there is of course one almighty battle sequence between the two sides but even that is peppered with oneliners moments of confusion and some of deep thought after all these two sides dont really want to be fighting each other the undoubted star of the show is the arrival of black panther chadwick boseman in his suit he prowls and leaps like his namesake and truly is a phenomenal foe for team cap his back story  an african prince and superhero  is an integral part to not only this film but his own eventual solo outing pencilled in for 2018 in case you missed it spiderman is also in this film yes marvel have reclaimed him from the deathby100terriblefilms sony were inflicting upon him hes back and hes team iron man the interesting thing about spiderman in this film is its the first time hes ever appeared on screen exactly how he is in the graphic novels peter parker tom holland is a young boy as in still in high school not a twentysomething newspaper photographer and with that age adjustment comes some genuinely funny moments he bounds through the fight sequence absolutely thrilled to meet everyone and not exactly sure how to control his own spideysuit there is also great humour from ant mans appearance and some quirky back and forths between the winter soldier sebastian stan and falcon anthony mackie of course robert downey jr has his usual eyerolls and sarcasm drenched delivery ultimately this is a captain america film and is therefore definitely more dialogue driven than a bogstandard blockbuster the one sticking point for me is the character of baron zemo when it was announced that daniel bruhl would be playing this character in the film twitter exploded everyone was buzzing with the news that this truly stellar actor would be joining the franchise except  he hasnt really the villain of the piece is entirely throwaway even the various avengers barely bat an eyelid at the mention of his name without his actions the characters would probably have developed in exactly the same way which sadly means there was ultimately very little point to his character however this is one of the best films marvel have produced it sets spiderman up beautifully for a series of films that the character deserves it also leaves a lot of options for where the rest of the avengers may be headed i would happily go and see this again
Apr 12 2017,positive,captain america civil war proves that marvel knows how to lay down a stunning foundation in order to detail an epic saga
Mar 23 2017,positive, coming out a month after the miserable bomb that was batman v superman has only helped to make marvels latest entry into the avengers franchise look like a damn classic in comparison captain america civil war isnt as instantly likeable as the first avengers movie was but its certainly a better night at the movies than watching batman and superman fight a battle in a bleak and murky hellscape and have no doubt this is more of an avengers movie than it is a captain america one with almost all of the avengers returning minus big hitters hulk and thor and with the addition of a few new members including spiderman tom holland and the black panther chadwick boseman to the team well actually teams as the central conflict pits the superheroes against each other the world has finally gotten a little fed up with the collective collateral damage inflicted by the avengers every time they save the world and after innocent lives are lost one again during the films opening battle thaddeus ross william hurt and his amazing wig and the un decide to force the avengers to sign an accord that would depending on how you look at it either completely limit their ability to act or put some much needed governance on their growing power somewhat ironically the renegade tony stark robert downey jr is for the signing of the accord while captain america chris evans is against it in both cases their reasoning is pretty selfish stark thinks stepping away from the avenging biz will result in the return of his beloved pepper potts who does not make an appearance in the movie while cap wants the freedom to help save his friend bucky aka the winter soldier sebastian stan who hes convinced has been wrongfully accused of a terrorist act as battle lines are drawn it comes down to a civil war with the avengers either joining team iron man or team captain and its this literal fight between them all that is the highlight of the movie once again i couldnt help but compare it to batman vs superman and its fight scenes which were dark depressing and ugly here we have a huge battle in broad daylight on a relatively uncluttered airfield fittingly devoid of people after all more innocent deaths are the last thing they need but more importantly the battle is fun seeing spiderman fight captain america is fun watching iron man fightinflight with falcon is fun watching hawkeye shoot arrows atwell ok watching hawkeye is never fun but the scene as a whole is still wildly entertaining culminating in a literal giant surprise while there is a villain in the story its not the usual invading alien hordes or omnipotent superbeing its just a dude with a grudge the avengers have a lot of death to answer to but in a clever way the movie also manages to indict us the audience for getting off on the massive destruction seen in all those previous films we should be ashamed of ourselves
Mar 7 2017,positive, both the films are similar on so many levels yet cannot be more different from each other as a whole while the dc movie was a sad reminder that superhero films can be a dull depressing and a horrible disappointment captain america civil war is a bright energetic and often hilarious celebration of the genre and a reassurance that superheroes despite their oversaturation in cinema screens can still be fun directed by the russo brothers who also made the previous captain america movie civil war is a sassy demonstration of marvel being at the very top of their game this is pretty much avengers 25 because almost everyone is in attendance and is way better than age of ultron and also more fun that the first avengers film in some ways if youve been following the marvel movies over the past few years you dont need the plot to be explained to you iron man downey jr and captain america evans have a disagreement  while the former wants the avengers to be regulated by a higher authority the latter doesnt believe in that because their mission is to simply save people and not indulge in bureaucracy but heres the thing  unlike in batman vs superman the conflict here is actually believable there is some genuine debate between iron man and captain america on the issue at hand and a fairly credible escalation of events that leads to a full on battle between the two most other marvel films are basically the same movie but this one is so different because it is bold enough to tread into bolder and intelligent themes the audience is presented with the interesting fact that the avengers should be answerable to someone and they should take responsibility for their actions all the pretty explosions you have been seeing are not just for show but they affect people in the movie universe houses are destroyed and people are killed there needs to be someone to watch the watchmen yes the problem that iron man and captain america have could be sorted if one of them simply told the other some vital information that someone is manipulating events but its easy to forget this contrivance when the pyrotechnics on screen are so damn good seriously civil war has some of the most amazing action sequences ever put on screen theres an insane scene at an airport that will leave your tongues wagging and dribble dropping on the floor the russos continue to incorporate the awesome tag team fight choreography where one superhero initiates his move on the bad guy and another superhero finishes off the baddie with his own move the best part of all this is that all the action takes place in broad daylight making the stuff happening on screen coherent whats more the movie has a whole bunch of laugh out loud moments a moment where captain scores a date and two of his friends nod in appreciation gets the whole theater roaring in laughter after watching the hilariously subversive deadpool i was convinced that i could never again take a straightforward superhero movie seriously captain america civil war undid my thought process just two months later the biggest takeaway from this film was that black panther looks sleek as hell and one just cant wait for the next slew of marvel superhero films like doctor strange so its not a question of whether you should see this movie its of which the biggest cinema screen in your city is and when the earliest show is
Feb 22 2017,positive, superhero films are seemingly a dime a dozen lately though only the beginning of may we have already seen the release of deadpool batman v superman dawn of justice and the current film captain america civil war with many more to come before the end of the year how to distinguish a film then in such an overcrowded world the russo brothers who also directed the exceptional winter soldier have somehow managed to do just that with some incredibly innovative action some deeper thoughtprovoking themes and a plethora of dynamic characters both old and new captain america civil war is among the very best of the marvel cinematic universethe buildup and confrontationcaptain america civil war is the next in the continuing series of the avengers now after several citywide destructions the avengers are under intense scrutiny by the government who will no longer tolerate their mostly supervisionfree organization the resulting clause called the sokovia accords would require the full permission of a governing body before they could intervene in any future worldwide incidents iron man robert downey jr still feeling guilty after his creation of the villainous ultron is completely in support of the accords while captain america chris evans is suspicious of the governments agenda preferring for the avengers to remain an independent organizationsource walt disney studios motion picturessuch conflicting points of view can seemingly only end in a fight yet its still not quite enough since this is a captain america movie it only makes sense for the conflict to mainly focus on his decisions which here are influenced by his past here the conflict comes in the form of bucky barnes aka the winter soldier sebastian stan who is a wanted fugitive for his war crimes though cap still supports him due to their history and also because bucky had been brainwashed while committing those crimesthe russo brothers really spent a great deal of effort to make the story of civil war believable though they had plenty of assistance from past films even as far back as the first avengers where captain america and iron man were always at odds they still needed to show some real depth to the story in order to make a film where two principal and likable superheroes fight one another the buildup from friend to enemy is slow but steady and by the conclusion their confrontation even becomes potentially one of the darker aspects of the entire marvel universecharacters new and oldits not just captain america and iron man who are fighting here either there are several superheroes who align with one or the other depending on their personal point of view on iron mans side is black widow scarlet johannson vision paul bettany war machine don cheadle and newcomers black panther chadwick boseman and spiderman tom holland and on caps side are the winter soldier in addition to falcon anthony mackie hawkeye jeremy renner antman paul rudd and scarlet witch elizabeth olsen such a numerous amount of superheroes could easily seem excessive yet the russo brothers manage to seamlessly weave their interactions and often in the least invasive way possibleonce again such an aspect is helped by past films which had already introduced nearly every character present with the exception of black panther and spiderman yet they needed to also move the arcs of existing characters in a way that was credible a character such as antman joining the captain america side makes sense due to his past life as a criminal while black panthers alliance with iron man is reasonable due to his life as the son of a king i had seen an interview with the russo brothers about this film in which they conceived of the story by running through the script with each character making sure that their arc from start to finish was engaging and never at odds with their previous motives the writers of batman v superman with its throwaway unlikable characters would have benefited from the same strategysource walt disney studios motion picturesas mentioned civil war is not only a captain america film but also a place to introduce further stories down the line the characters of black panther and spiderman were added to the story as a way to establish them before getting their own solo films black panther is coming in february 2018 while spiderman homecoming premieres next summer such an addition might have made civil war seem to be just another entry in a continuing franchise which is often one of the more criticized aspects of avengers age of ultron yet here they tackle the introductions with just the right amount of screentimechadwick boseman brings a confident strong screen presence as black panther both with and without the costume and despite only being introduced in this film he becomes one of the films most memorable characters also his costume is just too darn cool his screentime is limited but the russo brothers present just enough character development shrouded in mystery to make us interested in his upcoming filmi was also really looking forward to seeing spiderman who has long been my favorite comic character yet despite two separate film series he has never been properly presented on the big screen tobey maguire was decent as the nerdy peter parker but he was often stale and bland as the legendary superhero while andrew garfield was just the opposite playing spiderman well but a poor peter parker due to his suave manner how perfect then to finally see tom holland whose interpretation was a hybrid of these two aspects as a younger incarnation of spiderman he is juvenile spunky and clearly intelligent he is often the films comic relief which is necessary in a movie that sometimes gets almost too dark to handledark noirish tonethe marvel films are sometimes criticized for being too lighthearted with few dark themes out of fear of alienating a younger audience it was surprising to me then when greeted with the intensified action sequences of civil war with an emphasis on the final battle between iron man versus captain america and the winter soldier though the airport scene is the films climactic highlight this one dares to go even further into previously unseen territoryeven here though in a scene that could seem overly stressful due to the fiery emotions of the characters the russo brothers know when to hold back just enough to keep the film levelheaded an example is when captain america quotes the line i can do this all day a repeated quote that was part of his repertoire as far back as the first captain america film little callback aspects like this are really what help to distinguish civil war from the many superhero films out there which could easily have dwarfed it if not done precisely rightsource walt disney studios motion pictureshelmut zemo daniel brühl the films primary villain though motivated by an easily predictable motive also manages to further embellish the film with a deeper tone brühl who seems particularly wellsuited for playing the bad guy is very much marvels version of lex luthor though he is not a fighter on his own he is instead intent on simply setting plans in motion and then sitting back as the world comes apart before himzemo is one of the stronger marvel villains which makes the further addition of the character crossbones frank grillo dull in comparison a followup to his character in the winter soldier crossbones is all but wasted by the conclusion of the film really lending little to no impact on its events in a film with mostly fleshedout characters the character of crossbones is unfortunately one of its more forgettable aspectsintense beautifully choreographed actionat the end of the day though captain america civil war is a superhero film and as such there are numerous acts of adrenalinepumping action there are four main battle sequences in the film starting with the initial battle with the avengers and ending with the aforementioned iron man versus captain america and winter soldier fight the airport scene though is likely to be the one that people will think back on fondly in a scene that seems to stretch on for a great deal of time yet thankfully never wears out its welcome it features nearly every character from each side in its fightsource walt disney studios motion picturesthe tone here thankfully is dialed down lighter than the rest after all many of these characters are actually friends in person and as such they are not trying to kill one another some highlights here include the boyish attitude of spiderman the clawslashing attacks of black panther scarlet witchs strengthened abilities and without dropping any spoilers a huge moment for the character antman it is pure absolute unbridled entertainment which made me feel like a kid again watching cartoons on saturday mornings the russo brothers really understood the childlike wonderment of superheroes and they capture that in a scene that is rarely rivaled in the genreconclusioncaptain america civil war is easily amongst the very best in a mostly exceptional line of superhero films in the marvel cinematic universe with deeper themes and a darker tone it also manages to imbue some of the more wildly entertaining action scenes that i have yet to see in a comic book movie though the many characters may seem overwhelming and some of them appear wasted by the conclusion it mostly consists of an impressive array of both new and old and also contains quite possibly the best onscreen adaptation of the character spidermanin a year already piling up with superheroes captain america civil war is the most memorable thus far it manages to not only be a perfect conclusion for the captain america series but it also sets up films and stories in a way that makes me even more excited for the future of this franchisehighlightedp boxedfalse centerfalsehave you seen captain america civil war how would you rate it in terms of the

spiderman yet they needed to also move the arcs of existing characters in a way that was credible a character such as antman joining the captain america side makes sense due to his past life as a criminal while black panthers alliance with iron man is reasonable due to his life as the son of a king i had seen an interview with the russo brothers about this film in which they conceived of the

my favorite comic character yet despite two separate film series he has never been properly presented on the big screen tobey maguire was decent as the nerdy peter parker but he was often stale and bland as the legendary superhero while andrew garfield was just the opposite playing spiderman well but a poor peter parker due to his suave manner how perfect then to finally see tom holland whose interpretation was a hybrid of these two aspects as a younger incarnation of spiderman he is juvenile spunky and clearly intelligent he is often the films comic relief which is necessary in a movie that sometimes gets almost too dark to handledark noirish tonethe marvel films are sometimes criticized for being too lighthearted with few dark themes out of fear of alienating a younger audience it

airport scene is the films climactic highlight this one dares to go even further into previously unseen territoryeven here though in a scene that could seem overly stressful due to the fiery emotions

Feb 16 2017,positive,captain america civil war turns the avengers inside out forcing conflict between the characters while managing to stage big action set pieces and even bigger jokes
Feb 13 2017,positive, in  2014 captain america the winter soldier was released and changed the game for marvel films anthony and joe russo directed a film that felt different from any of its predecessors gone were the superhero cliches evil super villains and played out story lines instead the russo brothers chose to create an espionage thriller dealing with current event issues with a backdrop of an incredibly compelling relationship between the hero and the villain what resulted was perhaps the most complete and refreshing entry into the marvel collection and an overwhelming response for the russo brothers they were asked to direct the next two avengers films and also revisit the world of captain america with the latest entry into the franchise captain america civil war  captain america civil war is completely different from any other comic book movie the storyline of the film is something far greater than good vs evil both deal with very serious moral issues that are not black and white and there is no clear wrong or right side  winter soldier dealt with the use of unlimited power the main question that film raised was if the government had the potential to prevent any terrorist attack or threat to our safety should we allow that or would the access to that power become a threat to all of our well being in civil war the question that the russo brothers film brings up is how much power should the avengers be trusted with should they have complete unlimited power and does their power to protect us instead become a threat to all of us civil war works so well because of an incredible script and solid imaginative direction but it would be nothing without its cast the stellar writing of this film allow the actors to be people with emotions instead of walking talking costumes with superpowers the incredible additions to the cast shows the credibility of the script adding amazing talents of new and old such as william hurt martin freeman daniel bruhl and the fantastic chadwick boseman there also is the clever and incredibly hilarious addition of spiderman played by tom holland  it is hard to think of anything this film does wrong but there is one thing this film does better than any film i can ever remember   the line between good and evil is usually something so clearly drawn out in any film one goes to see there is typically right and wrong and the audience usually has a shared interest and a clear nudge in who and what to root for in civil war that is completely thrown out the marvel franchise has done such a beautiful job in creating so many characters we know and love they make us cheer they make us laugh and they can make us truly care for them in perhaps the greatest scene in any marvel film ever these characters square off against each other in a battle for what both sides believe is right and good  it is an incredible test of emotions for the viewer these are all people we love who are attacking the other people we love it is hard to imagine a similar moment in film where this was handled so eloquently and so well zack snyder could have learned so much from every frame of this film captain america civil war is the best comic book film since the dark knight this is due to the filmmakers choosing not to just make a great superhero movie but instead make a great film that blurs the line of what the world expects from them while the dark knight was an incredibly heavy film that felt more like a scorsese gangster classic with a man dressed as a bat civil war feels like a genre clash of all that is good it has moments that are very dark but it is so quick to follow up with fun surprises huge laughs and thrilling action sequences its nearly a perfect comic book film  the russo brothers are continuing to raise the bar for the avengers marvel and themselves it was hard to expect a better film than winter soldier and they somehow pulled it off over the next three years they will direct both additions to the avengers franchise with infinity war part i and part ii have they set the bar too high perhaps but if there was any two people to trust with taking the marvel franchise to an even higher high it is anthony and joe russo
Jan 1 2017,positive,  captain america civil war has by a conservative estimate 13 significant characters eleven of those characters have both birth names and superhero names not to mention superpowers and superaccessories every single one of those characters has a backstory  sometimes a lengthy and complex one  that helps drive the events of the plot   what this tells us is that tentpole films are no longer envisioned as selfenclosed stories geared to virgin viewers the marvelverse is a transmedia empire that encompasses theatrical films source comics multiple tv series and more and civil war assumes that viewers have a strong acquaintance with the previous films at the bare minimum if youve been sticking to the fullensemble avengers extravaganzas and didnt see antman for instance youre going to be mighty confused when paul rudd suddenly pops up and starts quipping   confused but not necessarily unhappy while civil war is as wide in scope and as informationoverloaded as last years avengers age of ultron its also more intimate and characterdriven and hence more compelling   thats because the plot pivots on two personal bonds one broken the other restored the broken bond is the one between the title character chris evans and iron mantony stark robert downey jr in the wake of ultrons devastation  for which stark bears the lions share of responsibility  the badboy inventor is ready to let the united nations step in and give marching orders to the superhero collective but captain americasteve rogers the unfrozen patriot is increasingly suspicious of the military brass and bureaucrats who want to control him   the other pivotal bond is between steve and his childhood friend bucky barnes sebastian stan who rose again as the brainwashed winter soldier in the film of that name when bucky is implicated in the assassination of an african monarch steve stands by his friend defying the un orders to take him down   captain americas renegade status splits the avengers in two camps and spirals into a conflict that culminates in an allout battle on an airfield with surprise guests like all the films action sequences this one is breathtakingly fast and cleverly staged by directors anthony and joe russo who also did the previous captain america installment   where the climax of batman v superman dawn of justice was positively wagnerian turning its battling superheroes into oddly similar icons the russos never let you forget youre watching comicbook characters they keep pausing the storm and fury for moments of bonding and bantering its a layering effect that works better with panels and speech balloons but the marvel team does it about as well as its possible to do onscreen more importantly all that character development pays off in the films eventual climax which feels less like a standard blockbuster blowout than a superpowered version of a pivotal cable drama episode   yes its all a bit much  by the films end not one but three characters have gone on tearful rampages fueled by the need to avenge a loved ones death besides bringing longsimmering conflicts to a boil civil war introduces players new to the movieverse such as chadwick boseman as the princely black panther and gives them conflicts of their own   for complete marvel neophytes its likely to be a baffling if loud and shiny experience but then that describes most blockbusters these days the good news about civil war is that those willing to bone up on the backstory will find characters they actually care about enough to root for neither steve nor tony is obviously wrong in his approach to the ageold problem of freedom and responsibility and both argue their cases with more grace than many figures on the current american electoral landscape civil wars get a lot less civil than this one   from 20142020 seven days allowed readers to comment on all stories posted on our website while weve appreciated the suggestions and insights right now seven days is prioritizing our core mission  producing highquality responsible local journalism  over moderating online debates between readers to criticize correct or praise our reporting please send us a letter to the editor or send us a tip well check it out and report the results online comments may return when we have better tech tools for managing them thanks for reading 
Dec 31 2016,positive,captain america civil war is without a doubt my new favorite superhero movie
Dec 30 2016,positive,when the big battle between two feuding factions of the avengers finally happens its a doozy
Dec 17 2016,negative, the simple task of a blockbuster director is to behave like a bargainbasement drug dealer supplying his convulsing frothing patient with the steady narcotic dripdrip all he needs to do is make sure the good stuff is coming through at sufficient a rate so everyone dutifully zombies their way back into the cinema when it is time for the next dose never mind if his stuff is cut with unbelievable dross if the acting is terrible the costumes are hideous if the wigs are preposterous and the codpieces are disappointingly flat loyal fans will still come back to be expertly fleeced  and screw everyone who hasnt watched the last umpteen films and has no idea whats going on
Dec 13 2016,positive, steve rogers aka captain america chris evans has a secret his best friend bucky barnes aka the winter soldier sebastian stan has managed to break his programming that keeps him an obedient soldier but he doesnt trust anyone and chooses to be left alone on the eve of the signing of the superhero registration act aka the sokovia accords named for the country age of ultron targeted cap and tony stark aka iron man robert downey jr are at odds over the implications mainly that politicians would decide who should and shouldnt be helped theyre both right in their own way but when bucky being fingered in a terrorist attack is offered as proof of needing such un legislation rogers decides to confront bucky himself and before he can be apprehended by iron man  that is if the black panther chadwick boseman doesnt kill the winter soldier first in an act of revenge most of the current marvel cinematic universe squares off in a throwdown over principles and secrets as lines are drawn and friendships are tested but who will pay the ultimate price for their convictions captain america the winter soldier directors the russo brothers twisted the mcu formula with a cold war spy thriller take on the superhero with civil war they dare not only to pit our heroes against one another but challenge them in the worst possible way sure comic book fans love to argue who can whip who in a fight but the trailers suggest theres no way civil war can end in anything but a downer while its pretty clear no one important dies in the mcu it sure looks like neither steve nor tony have any intention of backing down its also probably a good thing hulk and thor managed to steer clear of this hold onto your privates generals  while the big set piece is the superbrawl that ends the second act the third act is exactly what we expected hard to watch in the most dramatic way possible if youre the kind of viewer who wonders why name actors are picked for these parts instead of just any upandcoming thespian these are those moments for a geniusbillionaireplayboyphilanthropist robert downey jr knows how to bring the haunted painting tony stark as someone who never wanted the responsibility that goes with the limelight  heavy is the head that wears the crown in full contrast to the getitdonenow and grieve later attitude of steve rogers this is exactly what we asked for since he and tony squared off in the avengers but it is also not what we wanted  and thats a good thing there are consequences for actions and nothing here is black or white before the world went spiraling out of control however we are treated to some amazing moments as superheroes meet one another for the first time including the sonysanctioned debut of spiderman in the mcu due for his own feature film homecoming next summer the airport battle is a comic book doublesized issue full of combat goodness and much easier to follow than the age of ultron finale freeforall including all the fanboy reluctance of beating up fellow admired heroes and plenty of great oneliners the scene is what it is but it isnt all fun and games unlike dc where characters only appear to have one emotion at a time complexity is the order of the day and you never know wholl do what until it happens those invested in these characters may feel the need to scream at the screen a time or two yeah it does that its interesting that while this film was being made simultaneously as batman vs superman dawn of justice theres a sense of civil war being the right way to do this a bullet list of what can work and what shouldnt be done when heroes collide  its like they knew this isnt the kind of movie you buy to watch over and over again its the kind you know which scenes are you favorites to skip to and for watching all the makingof features to remind yourself its just a movie kudos to the russos for bringing the heat but lets not do this downer thing again for a while okay
