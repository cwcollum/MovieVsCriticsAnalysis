Jul 28 2023,positive, youd think that tacking on an additional 43 minutes to the threehour movie would be overkill but the extended version actually feels shorter than the theatrical release  possibly because it tells a more thorough story two towers continues where the fellowship of the ring left off with the fellowship splintered into two groups frodo and sam head for mordor to destroy the ring they are aided by gollum a mysterious creature who once was a hobbit but now may not be trusted meanwhile the trifecta of man elf and dwarf aragorn legolas gimli head to rohan to defend the last of a dying breed  human beings where the extended version enhances the original theatrical release is in its filling in of the details that director peter jackson had to cut out to ensure that moviegoers wouldnt leave theaters before the film was over anyone who saw two towers in theaters last winter will recognize that the films beginning is different before gollum confronts frodo and sam the pair is shown joking and pratfalling before they realize exactly how lost they are their always ravenous fellow hobbits merry and pippin also get extended play at one point floating through a sea of delectable treats we also learn that the studly warrior and wouldbe king aragorn actually is an old man of 87 the best back story though is that of boromir and his brother faramir boromir was killed in fellowship in the theatrical version of two towers we saw faramir as a rather heartless soldier who treated frodo and sam unkindly in the dvd version jackson shows how the brothers grew up  with their father favoring boromir and treating faramir as the screwup he never was you dont excuse his behavior but you begin to understand why he is who he is this fourdisc set also includes extras such as production documentaries photo galleries and a really cool look at the making of gollumsmeagol but the real treat is those extra 43 minutes that tie the film together without making it feel any longer currently you have javascript disabled in order to post comments please make sure javascript and cookies are enabled and reload the page click here for instructions on how to enable javascript in your browser
Aug 23 2022,positive, peter jacksons the fellowship of the ring was an extraordinary introduction to his lord of the rings trilogy it not only introduced us to its compelling assortment of characters but it also firmly planted us within jrr tolkiens vast enchanting world but its the second installment the two towers where the series truly hits its stride the two towers takes the story of its predecessor and expands it in every way fascinating new characters more lands throughout middleearth and even higher stakes than before but one of jacksons many great accomplishments is how seamlessly he blends these new pieces into the existing fabric and despite the immensity of his scope the movie never loses its intimacy picking up where fellowship left off frodo elijah wood and sams sean astin journey to destroy the one ring has grown more arduous and the weight of the ring more burdensome as the two struggle to find a path to mordor the sallow emaciated gollum andy serkis secretly follows them he was the rings former owner consumed by its power and desperate to reclaim it when gollum is discovered frodo shows pity and uses him as a guide against the pleas of a concerned sam a second story thread follows aragorn viggo mortensen legolas orlando bloom and gimli john rhysdavies as they follow the trail of their abducted hobbit companions merry dominic monaghan and pippin billy boyd they are led through the wartorn lands of rohan whose king theodin bernard hill lies under a spell of the wicked wizard saruman christopher lee and yet a third story thread follows the aforementioned merry and pippin who manage to escape their urukhai captors after the orc soldiers are attacked by éomer karl urban and his exiled riders of rohan the two hobbits hide deep within fanghorn forest where they encounter a mysterious tree beings called ents the challenges for this incredible threeheaded story are obvious huge in scale and with a ton of ground to cover yet vitally important that it all comes together jackson melds together his many moving parts with remarkable precision and of the several new characters introduced not a one feels wasted or undeserved each fit and have a place in tolkiens tumultuous world yet have their own personal storylines that take form without ever feeling pointless or intrusive its a remarkable mixture of character and narrative then there is the genius of jacksons technique from his sweeping camera combing the exquisite new zealand landscapes to the subtlest of closeups capturing every worry concern and pain of the characters equally exhilarating are the action scenes both small and epic in size its hard not to be blown away by his framing of the action as well as weta workshops extraordinary special effects jackson really opens it up with the first of the series huge battlefield sequences the battle for helms deep remains my favorite segment in the entire trilogy much more could be talked about including jacksons knack for not only building tension but maintaining it throughout a sequence also the two towers highlights jacksons keen ability to convey to the audience an incredible sense of the mystical and magical the world he and his teams place us in are rich with imagination and the fantastical but the greatest thing about the series is that its far more than eye candy and sparkly window dressing its the characters and their stories that form the heart of trilogy thats especially true for the two towers someday i will have to watch these movies again  i remember not liking two towers as much because it deviated from the book and i am a bit of a purist when it comes to that haha  but i really do need to watch them again and maybe appreciate this one for its onscreen value because books and screens are two very different mediums very true i get being a purist but youre exactly right they are very different mediums for me deviating from source material is okay as long as it makes sense and serves well the story the filmmaker is telling what stinks is when filmmakers deviate from the source material and the results miss the mark its tricky though the whole trilogy has been on starz lately as i rewatched them as theres so many things about the the trilogy that is awesome  i agree that the two towers doesnt get enough love as i enjoyed the strands of narrative into the three journeys of the fellowship and how it impacts everyone  the extended version of that film i feel is an improvement as it gave the audience more information about who faramir as well as boromir who we first saw in the film as kind of a dick but once we see him in the 2nd part of the extended film  we realize that he was acting more like his father and was more concerned in giving his brother some praise i adore the extended editions they fill in so much information i do love boromir i was indeed seduced by the power of the ring but he was also a great redemption story he sacrificed himself to try and buy time for the others and his heartfelt confession to aragorn still gets me same here  i also loved what they did for faramir in the extended version of the film where he took frodo sam and gollum to a secret path as it showed his own path for not just redemption but also to keep the ring away from gondor great review but seeing the lord of the rings in the same line with the word retro felt weird for me and a little bit painful because for me it seemed like yesterday that the lord was in cinemas and i do miss very much the 20002002 period in films my favourite has got to be the first movie but i do get all the appreciation for this one too i know im thinking i should take retro off is it really retro i dont know it would certainly make me feel better if it wasnt lol while ill always have a soft spot for fellowship particularly the balrog sequence two towers will always be the best overall film in the trilogy for story character and pacing and of course the helms deep attack when that wall blew apart so did my mind just an astonishing film accomplishment  disclosure over the last few weeks ive been digging into both the rings and hobbit appendicies dvds reminiscing over my love of all things middle earth oh man those extended editions are so good love them as for two towers so many scenes stand out when the wall blewyes the expressions and sense of dread its fabulous you really feel a sense of doom but when gandolf shows up with a light to the easti get chills

Mar 12 2022,positive, peter jacksons cinematic recreation of lord of the rings the two towers 2002 is thrilling enthralling and dizzyingly exciting jackson finds the soul of the film in viggo mortensens wandering warriorprince aragorn reveals the torment in elijah woods chosenone pilgrim frodo and the soulcrushing weight of the ring that tolkien could only talk around and he turns the wary relationship between frodo and the gnarled psychotically obsessed gollum into the defining drama of frodos hopes and fears along the quest the famously computer generated gollum is a wonder of a character a feral stray dog with a schizophrenic nature at war with himself when he gets his first taste of kindness from frodo as tragically human as any character in the party the motioncapture performance by andy serkis set the bar for the marriage of acting and special effects jackson dares to throw the viewer into the fray without little more than a brief nightmarish flashback and turns the battle of helms deep a brief ten page episode in the novel into the thrilling turning point in the war the first glimpse of the coming apocalypse and the triumph of solidarity in the face of the march of evil jacksons camera once again swoops over landscapes like an eagle charges through the hordes that blanket the earth and slows only in moments of intimacy more than simply translate the fantasy masterpiece to the screen with respect jackson brings blood and thunder and human scale to a tale so long relegated to the archetypes of myth the returning cast includes ian mckellen as gandalf sean astin as frodos loyal friend samwise dominic monaghan and billy boyd as hobbits merry and pippin orlando bloom as elf warrior legolas john rhysdavies as dwarf warrior gimli and christopher lee as saruman cate blanchett liv tyler hugo weaving miranda otto bernard hill david wenham karl urban and brad dourif costar months after the film was released to dvd and bluray jackson released an extended version exclusively to home video running almost four hours long jacksons extended version weaves not just deleted scenes back into his vision but additional background and character insight shaved out of existing scenes most of it is appropriately folded into the beginning which reintroduces frodo with an entirely different scene and ending giving the audience more time to ease down from the power of the battle of helms deep though not essential information it adds in the kind of weight that gives the epic even greater heft and home video is the perfect arena for such an expansion there is about 40 minutes of new footage all told 11 minutes of longer version belong to credits dedicated to the members of the lord of the rings fan club dont miss a single recommendation subscribe to the stream on demand weekly newsletter your email address will not be shared and follow us on facebook and x formerly known as twitter supplements on the two disc special edition of the original theatrical version include the 14minute madeforcable documentary on the set the lord of the rings the two towers originally made for starz and the 43minute wb special return to middleearth sean astins fiveminute side project the long and short of it a sweet little short made with volunteers from the cast and crew and a making of astins film and eight brief behindthescenes featurettes originally made for  disc 3 and 4the appendicesfeature an epic documentary to match the production following the film from adapting and scripting through constructing the sets and props shooting the production and creating the special effects to editing scoring and mixing the film all organized in wellshaped chapters that can be viewed individually or seen straight through as a single sixhour overview the chapter on gollum a fascinating invitation into the process of creating a fully fleshed out cgi character and a tribute to the skills of andy serkis whose performance helped sculpt and enrich that character can stand alone as a feature length piece to supplement the documentary are an atlas of middleearth tracing the journey an interactive map of new zealand showing the shooting locations and galleries featuring hundreds of behindthescenes photographs personal cast photos and production art which can also be viewed as slideshows with commentaries by the artists the gift set features a gollum polystone statue created by sideshow weta a bonus dvd with a documentary about the weta workshop and how the gollum statue was created and a printed companion piece showing how gollum evolved from pencil sketch to digital character sean axmaker is a seattle film critic and writer he writes the weekly newspaper column stream on demand and the companion website and his work appears at rogerebertcom turner classic movies online the film noir foundation and parallax view

Jan 10 2016,positive,    before i start i must confess that i have never read the lord of the rings trilogy or the hobbit for that matter so before any rabid lord of the rings fans pull out the torches and pitchforks to burn down my castle i want to warn you that i dont know squat about how the two towers compared to the book in a word the two towers is stunning it is truly a masterpiece better than the first film the two towers delivers a powerful story of fighting against insurmountable odds like the other legendary epic films of the 20th century the lord of the rings is shaping up to be a trilogy to live on in movie history where the fellowship of the ring was clearly frodos movie the two towers spends more time with aragorn a human gimli a dwarf and legolas an elf the fellowship is now broken with gandalf presumed dead and three parts scattered across middle earth frodo baggins elijah wood and his fellow hobbit samwise gamgee sean astin are the keepers of the allpowerful ring created by the dark lord sauron to control middle earth now broken off from the group frodo and samwise continue towards mount doom where they can finally dispose of the ring properly however along their way they pick up a companion  a wiry gangly creature named gollum once in possession of the ring gollum now joins the two hobbits to maybe see the end to my precious meanwhile aragorn viggo mortensen gimli john rhysdavies  and legolas orlando bloom are in pursuit of an army of urukhai genetically transformed orcs for the uninitiated that have kidnapped the other two hobbits pippin billy boyd and merry dominic monaghan along the way the three heroes meet up with gandalf ian mckellen now promoted to gandalf the white who has been resurrected to help finish his quest the fractured fellowship heads to the city of rohan and befriends the king they stay with the rohan to help defend this last vestige of humans from the 10000strong urukhai army even though it is a threehour film the two towers doesnt waste any time getting into the story where the the fellowship of the ring had a nifty little intro section in which cate blanchett explained all the hubbub about the rings and their powers the two towers just dives right into the film not that this is a bad thing but if youre memorys a bit fuzzy you might want to rent the fellowship of the ring and watch it again before you go to this sequel not only does director peter jackson waste no time getting into the film he wastes no time at all in fact this three hour epic is one of those few films where you leave feeling they could have spent even more time with story explanation and exposition the film is so jampacked with excitement story and characters that some of the faces youve seen in the first film are mere flashbacks in this one actors like liv tyler as the princess arwen cate blanchett as the forest queen galadriel and hugo weaving as the elf king elrond peredihl have only bit parts here but this doesnt detract from the film in fact theres so much in the two towers that youll need to not just invest three hours in it  but six or even perhaps nine  to absorb everything it has to offer the incredible battle sequences are breathtaking producing armies in the thousands to fight against one another filling the entire screen additional special effects kudos are due for the creature gollum which is completely computer generated the technology has grown so much over the years that it is able to emote almost at the level of a real actor at times it is so very easy to forget that gollum is just a smattering of pixels because he blends so well into the background and feels so real bringing cgi into the 21st century gollum isnt the annoying mess that was jar jar binks of course there could have been more of the character of saruman the white simply for the fact that he is played by the unbeatable christopher lee strangely the flashes back to sarumans stronghold in orthanc seem the most enjoyable with lees presence overseeing the creation of the urukhai army perhaps one of the best sequels ever made the two towers stays true to the first film simply because it was filmed simultaneously along with the third film this way the production design characters and feel is completely seamless the only film to come this close to the look and feel of the original is harry potter and the chamber of secrets with a more satisfying ending and a tremendous battle that makes braveheart look like a group of kindergartners playing red rover the two towers whets the appetite for the final film the return of the king thank god we only have to wait a year 
Nov 12 2014,positive, peter jacksons the two towers aka look whos tolkien too makes no concession to those unacquainted with the first part of the trilogy the fellowship of the ring other than to reprise the wizard gandalfs spectacular fall into the pit of khazaddûm he expects us to know at least in general terms the tale of some decent folk in middleearth embarking on a dangerous quest to place the one ring beyond reach of its wicked creator by consigning it to the fire of doom in the process and to defeat the evil schemes of the megalomaniac wizard saruman the commanding christopher lee so from the start the chief heroic characters of the first part are split into three separate groups that will not meet again in this episode this leads to occasional confusion but produces pace and variety in the first strand the leading hobbit frodo baggins elijah wood and his devoted squire sam sean astin meet the treacherous hominoid gollum one of the influences presumably for dobby in harry potter who becomes their guide in the second the warrior aragorn viggo mortensen looking sounding and swashbuckling like errol flynn the pawky scottish dwarf gimli and the elf archer legolas ride to the defence of the embattled king theoden bernard hill the third strand features the two lesser hobbits pippin and merry who are protected by treebeard a splendid walking tree out of arthur rackham who gets a good laugh from the line what is a hobbit treebeard commands a company of fellow giant trees and in addition to delivering a discreet ecomessage about deforestation another of sarumans sins they prove formidable fighters discovering that their bite is worse than their bark pippin and merry lead their arboreal allies in a dunsinanestyle assault against the evil empire there is no girl in any of these three groups and the film finds little work for its heroines this is also the case in harry potter and the chamber of secrets where hermione is also marginalised certainly there is nothing like the elf maiden arwens marvellous equestrian rescue of frodo a major highlight of the earlier picture their job is to flee with the children and the old folk when the beautiful aristocratic eowyn miranda otto wants to take up arms she is upbraided by her uncle king theoden who believes that the fighting should be left to the men and god knows there is plenty of it this film packs enough battles into three hours to keep the residents of valhalla talking for a year even the peaceful elf community decides to join the humans in the war against the totalitarian sauron apparently abandoning their old separatist slogan we our elves fivedigit hordes mostly digitally created go into battle every couple of minutes with losses that even on the western front jrr tolkien had firsthand knowledge as an infantry officer would have been extreme the battles and sieges are conducted with the ferocity of the crusades agincourt and stalingrad and they are led up to and orchestrated in a manner that recalls the great movie epics of fritz lang and sergei eisenstein these sequences are breathtaking as indeed is much of a beautifully designed and photographed film that draws for its visual style on caspar david friedrich the preraphaelites art nouveau illustrations for childrens books and the apocalyptic biblical landscapes all flaming mountains lightning and floods of the victorian visionary john martin the new zealand settings have a rugged primeval grandeur though there are too many swooping helicopter shots over the landscape setting the second harry potter film beside this second tolkien confirms with even greater clarity the difference detected between the two enterprises when the first movies appeared together a year ago though both are eclectic in their mythic and literary sources harry potter and the chamber of secrets is to the two towers what glossy pantomime versions of robinson crusoe and aladdin are to the daniel defoe novel and the arabian nights stories these tolkien films have a weight and seriousness that very few swordandsorcery pictures of the past 30odd years have attained john boormans excalibur is the most obvious exception and the lord of the rings was a cherished project of his that he was unable to get off the ground in the early seventies the two towers can even stand the selfreferential speech at the end by brave honest hobbit sam about the force of mythic tales of good against evil in which he wonders whether he would be worthy of figuring in such a saga himself there is along the way as you might expect from a legendary tale much topical resonance with references both fortuitous two towers under attack and expected the belief that evil is abroad and that there are things worth fighting for to current concerns the movie with narrative justification and commercial canniness concludes with a cliffhanger that aims to have us sitting in the same seats a year hence to see how it all turns out in the concluding episode the return of the king this is likely to be happier more decisive and infinitely more satisfying than anything that will happen to our world in the next 12 months
Nov 12 2014,positive, like a mighty glacier on the move a tripartite enterprise of such epic yearnings as lord of the rings needs time and patience for its impact to register first time round i was a sceptic such protracted introductions so many characters and what unpronounceable names  i was not a happy fanof jrr tolkien but after a years intermission i emerged a convert from part two  shattered shaken stirred even worshipful it has a grandeur that its not hyperbole to call miltonic moreover though its no incitement to cinemagoing the film has collected a fearful dread from the way the world has gone since 911 peter jacksons film unplanned though it was now looks like a prophetic allegory for osama bin ladens messianic threats to world order as well as the besieged resistance of the great and the small even the subtitle the two towers involuntarily recalls the twin towers lines like a new power is coming its victory is at hand or there will be no dawn for men or war is upon us have gained the resonance of fundamentalism that overlays cinematic fantasy fortunately if the world is spared its the fantasy that will prevail what an eyeful it is this is probably the greatest battlepiece composed for the screen since eisensteins ivan the terrible computergenerated imagery now adds its own genetic wonders to the elves giants humans and multispecies combatants tusked mastodons lumber over the field of battle with howdahs like minarets on their backs housing the avantgarde troops a winged pterodactyl with a sinister cowled rider in the saddle flaps over the ramparts like a malevolent spotter aircraft wild boars as big and fierce as rampaging tigers attack the horse artillery a huge dam splits asunder in a flood that makes cecil b demilles famous parting of the red sea look like a piddling trickle and then theres the final battle of helms deep the fortified keep of the king of rohan that saruman the wicked wizard puts to the siege  gustave dores great engravings of paradise lost look as if theyve been given the gift of life as huge armies clash by night you can believe that there are 10000 men on screen at once all manner of munitions from land harpoons to scaling ladders 50foot high and hung with invaders reduce the implacable walls to rubble new lands new civilisations new characters keep the fanciful parameters of tolkiens world continually expanding into that private universe that constitutes the multipart works appeal probably like me youll be groping through the first 20 minutes or so just to discover or recall whos who fear not the story splits into four distinct parts as we follow each group of characters through a wonderland of necromancy where graecoroman gothic preraphaelite and hollywood medieval styles of culture and habitat all coexist with a bestiary of monsters and a pantheon of gods hobbits frodo and sam elijah wood sean astin push overland to destroy the baleful ring that has cursed the world and en route finally ensnare the skinny nearnaked gollum thats been stalking them this cgi creature is clearly a genetic relative of star wars yoda and a distant cousin of harry potters dobby completely computerised though based on andy sergiss miming of his movements he is a capering quadruped who in return for sparing his life leads them safely through a fearful swamp where dead warriors lie beneath the water  a tennysonian image of eerie beauty aragorn viggo mortensen the dwarf gimli john rhysdavies and the blond bowman elf legolas orlando bloom travel together and lift the dropsical curse placed on king theoden bernard hill by the slimy enchanter grima wormtongue brad dourif and as if all this werent enough saruman christopher lee does his forecast of a bin laden figure as he sends his urukhai legions marching into battle with a percussive tramp of ironshod feet that is the films most ominous keynote the surprise guest in this extraordinary assortment whose only common feature is their possession of more hairstyles than afghanistans former taliban rulers could muster turns out to be gandalf the white ian mckellen last seen apparently spiralling to his doom in a bottomless pothole of flames the wizard makes his comeback unsinged and freshly laundered in a whiterthanwhite ensemble that alone strikes terror into the unwashed and unkempt enemies he confronts if the mood of the movie is darker than part one and the stakes are higher the story moves much more quickly from location to location admittedly tolkiens women the elf queen galadriel cate blanchett and the elf princess arwen liv tyler still defeat jacksons attempt to animate their stainedglass radiance but few will worry with the two towers tolkiens tapestry of middle earths battle for survival has achieved a majestic proportion chivalric and quixotic earthly and magical an experience that reaches beyond the dimensions of the cinema screen and somehow reflects the global unease of the world in the first years of the 21st century
Nov 12 2014,positive, is this the longest computer game in cinematic history the lord of the rings the two towers is like being trapped in a nerds bedroom whenever you take a step toward the door he cries no you must watch this bit this really is amazing according to the distinguished critic alexander walker the story moves much more quickly from location to location than in the first film since i left the cinema feeling as if i had got off a longhaul flight i can only thank providence that i missed part one certainly the locations change from one slab of rock with a lego castle and dry ice to another perhaps this is to make up for the lack of movement in the characters the only protagonist with any human range is gollum who is computeranimated equity must be getting nervous that an animated green house elf called dobby is the star of harry potter and now gollum is the only character worth watching in lord of the rings more worrying than a geeky attachment to large armies and controlled explosions is the geopolitical metaphor the film is being described as a story for our times post 911 i suppose britain is where the hobbits come from and it is up to us to fight for middle earth there is good in the world and its worth fighting for says sam the yokel hobbit but after that the metaphor becomes unsettling who are these hideous alien races with terrible teeth and what do walking trees have to do with it i imagine that when male critics say they feel emotionally rewarded or even worshipful towards this film it may be because men do rather well out of it they look great in armour they do not have to say much more than this is a good sword or let the battle begin they can fall off cliffs wrestle with prehistoric beasts fight off thousands of orcs and remain shaven and unharmed women on the other hand are always being sent away liv tyler floats off accompanied by folk music and a spirited if anaemic blonde princess who takes a fancy to the warrior aragorn cue swordplay is dispatched to a back passage with all the other toothless old women and grubby children the dialogue is mystical and banal the facial expressions stoned and i cannot overemphasise the length of this film it took peter jackson nearly six years to make the trilogy and you feel that you have been with him all the way as the two towers lumbered towards its overblown climax i shook my numb body and looked at my watch the hobbits were heading towards a flame on the horizon a little far off for my liking but perhaps they could get a lift on one of those winged dinosaurs the beautiful brave menfolk were galloping over the hills are we nearly there yet i asked my rapt 10yearold son last year i emerged from the preview of the fellowship of the ring with two principal thoughts that this was the grandest most spectacular piece of cinema i had ever seen and that i would happily sit through it all over again after watching the second instalment of the trilogy the two towers i had precisely the same response what this film does is to repair the small faults of the first  the lengthy exposition the humourless dialogue the excess of hobbitish bucolia  and build on its strengths the two towers feels even darker grander and bolder than its predecessor the pacing is braver the fusion of real actors animatronics and computergenerated imagery even more successful now i should make two things clear although as a child i adored the hobbit the lord of the rings trilogy  and in particular the two towers  seemed too big too flabby too much of a good thing whats more although i like onscreen belligerence as much as the next man i have always found epic battles a formless impersonal turnoff but only the most inveterate wimp could fail to be moved by the climactic battle between the defenders of rohan and the legions of urukhai at helms deep it lifts you from your comfy popcornencrusted seat and hurls you into another time place and existence the buildup is long the tension almost unbearable but it is worth the wait under raging stormclouds the 10000 invaders try to penetrate the stone fortress with a hideous spielbergian thud they march up to it en masse they send 80foot ladders up to the ramparts they blow a gaping hole in the wall sending 10ton stones raining down upon their own men by cutting between magnificent digitally aided sweeping shots of the scene and individual and very bloody deaths the director peter jackson makes you both participant and observer in a fantastical battle that leaves you gasping for breath theres so much else to enjoy the very human exchanges between the various protagonists the surprisingly touching central performances  and the sublime villains and in particular gollum an extraordinarily rich alldigital character who reminds you that dobby  who appears in the second harry potter film  was nothing but an irritating onedimensional nerd
Nov 12 2014,positive, the big question is is the two towers up to the standard set by the fellowship of the ring i have to tell you that the answer is no its better  more spectacular more exciting more emotionally rewarding  not only is this head and shoulders above the other films of 2002 it is going to inspire a whole new generation of moviegoers and filmmakers with the magic that only the cinema can create its fabulous and fantastic in the truest sense of those words  unlike the first film where the narrative followed one group of characters the story here divides into three frodo and sams journey towards mordor guided by the potentially treacherous gollum merry and pippins abduction by the urukhai and their encounter with the inhabitants of fangorn forest and the attempt by aragorn legolas and gimli first to rescue merry and pippin and then to save rohan and its bewitched king from the forces of saruman  the climactic event of the two towers the seemingly hopeless defence of helms deep against insuperable odds is an outstanding extended battle sequence that dwarfs any others on celluloid but that is only the greatest of many wonders  several other action sequences would have made spectacular climaxes for any other movie  especially the warg attack on the emigrants from rohan and the ents angry storming of isengard  one of the greatest services director peter jackson and his team have done to tolkien is to grasp the importance of landscape most of tolkiens finest writing lay in his descriptions of middle earth itself digital technology has added to the natural unspoiled marvels of new zealand and created a world at once fantastical and familiar  one of the many excellent aspects of jacksons script cowritten with his wife fran walsh philippa boyers and stephen sinclair is that it supplies comic and romantic relief to go with all the action and grandeur  neither comedy nor women were tolkiens strong points and these enhancements are part of the reason why the films are destined to reach an even wider and more appreciative audience than the books  especially astounding is jacksons attention to directorial detail two of the moments which make the heart leap are when the elf legolas a gets on a horse and b travels down a staircase these events may not read like much on the page but thanks to jacksons imagination they amount to two of the most stirring moments ever seen  those killjoys who dismiss the lord of the rings as mere escapism should stop to consider whether its tale of racial hatred genocide the corrupting nature of power the need to stand against evil and yet guard against the temptation of using extreme force isnt of greater relevance to the world of today than most films of socalled realism  theoden king of rohan an oscarworthy supporting performance by bernard hill has to decide between isolationism and involvement in a way that is relevant to several modern western leaders especially those in france and germany  king of the elves superbly played by hugo weaving has to resolve whether his peoplehave any further responsibilities to the world they are shortly to leave behind  gollum  a stunning breakthrough in computer animation and wonderfully voiced by andy serkis  has to decide between his doglike devotion to frodo elijah wood and his feral determination to steal back his ring  these ethical dilemmas are treated with sensitivity and seriousness yet the pace of the storytelling never flags this is the speediest three hours in the cinema i have ever experienced  the quality of the acting is amazingly high viggo mortensen as aragorn easily dons the mantle of epic hero that used to be worn by charlton heston and hes a lot sexier  the triangular love relationship between him arwen liv tyler acting better in elvish than she ever has in english and eowyn theodens niece played by the beautiful miranda otto is deftly and delightfully done the rise of post war cynicism and the decline of the western and the war film have not diminished the huge need in the popular cinema for heroes in the lord of the rings trilogy there is a whole range of heroes for anybody to identify with  i know a few people who felt distanced and bored by the fellowship of the ring but im afraid the failure lies in their power to appreciate it not in the film itself  necessarily darker and more violent than its predecessor it may be too overwhelming for those under eight for the rest of us its an overwhelming experience in a totally positive way 
Nov 12 2014,positive,much of the movie is exciting but none of it is as satisfying as what jackson was able to create in fellowship the first film
Nov 12 2014,positive, frodo played by elijah wood feels the increasing burden of the one ring in the central film of the epic trilogy the lord of the rings the two towers without breaking stride the lord of the rings the two towers picks up briskly where last years duly celebrated the fellowship of the rings first chapter in director peter jacksons grandly ambitious adaptation of jrr tolkiens weighty literary trilogy left off jackson presumably figured that no recap of the first chapter was needed to set this hotly anticipated new adventure off on its rousing complicated way and hes probably right since it appears only trolls in caves and the odd wandering gollum are unfamiliar with tolkiens deeply allegorical works which have lately served as influence and inspiration for everyone from george lucas and his star wars mythology on through jk rowling and her wizardladen harry potter books the two towers shot backtoback with the first and third in jacksons film trilogy simply assumes moviegoers are up to speed and so plunges them without ceremony into the ongoing narrative that quickly veers off into three complex subplots when last we saw young hobbit frodo baggins elijah wood the reluctant ringbearer he was off with his spirited sidekick samwise gamgee sean astin into the wilds of mordor to cast the cursed ring into the fires of hell this film picks up their quest as the two hobbits endure the harsh rigors of the journey and encounter a wily gollum  a mutated reptilian hobbit of the stoor family  who covets the ring as precious but soon becomes their ally and unreliable guide another story thread tracks aragorn viggo mortensen as he travels with elfin archer legolas orlando bloom and the blustery dwarf gimli john rhysdavies to aid the noble men of rohan as they defend the fortress citadel helms deep against marauding hordes of goonish orcs set loose by the evil white wizard saruman christopher lee a third storyline follows the captured hobbits merry dominic monaghan and pippin billy boyd as they escape from the orcs and make their way through the fangorn forest there they ally with ancient talkingwalking trees led by the wizened gnarled treebeard voiced by rhysdavies to attack sarumans stronghold of isengard where the villain has decimated the forest to fuel his rebel armies perhaps more aggressively than in the first film jackson a new zealander whose previous credits have ranged from the erratic horror outing the frighteners to the chillingly good heavenly creatures reconfigures some of the books plot elements trims some scenes and characters and transforms tolkiens dense imageheavy prose into a swift brawny cinematic tale once again the film runs nearly three hours but for the most part it feels sharply focused and kinetic as it packs in just enough general exposition to inform nonreaders while including plenty of smartly selective local color and arcane tolkien lore to satisfy fans of the novels on the technical side jacksons transition between films is seamless and the sequel builds on the overall visual splendor of the first with its painterly matte work and epicscale set designs in tone this one is darker and more morose it also might be argued that the battle scenes feel a bit overlong overproduced and visually repetitive but its hard to argue with their thrilling impact while the acting is once more solid throughout even with the shakespearean ian mckellen given too little to do as the good wizard gandalf the most impressive performance of all comes from digital magicians who created the wretched gollum smeagol cunningly voiced by andy serkis with his lizardly aspect wispy grey hair and large expressive eyes the tiny smeagol is a feral creature of amazing comic and dramatic force when he agonizes over his lowly plight or carries on schizophrenic dialogues between his inner angels and demons he displays an amazing facility for expressing subtle emotions that puts some human actors in the shade surely its the first time a computergenerated character has delivered such a truly gripping dramatic performance on screen if the oscarnominated the fellowship of the ring was a selfcontained wonder the two towers is more reliant on familiarity with the first film and tolkiens vast lore that rare moviegoer whos unfamiliar with either will be lost in the wilderness here however jackson and company did such a stellar job of establishing their claim on tolkiens legacy with last years film its doubtful the two towers will fail to thrill and amaze with its art and technical craft with adventure two now squarely on the screen and the essential lord of the rings saga well and twothirds told fans can slowly begin to look forward to a satisfying conclusion with the release of the return of the king next holiday season once again anticipation is sweet

Nov 12 2014,positive,while some people think this surpasses the original i dont the storylines are fractured and geographically and narratively its sometimes hard to figure out whats going on but the positives are many
Nov 12 2014,positive, what are the ents going to look like thats the anticipatory cringe for any tolkien fan faced with a film version of the two towers the corresponding question in the fellowship of the ring  how on earth will they tackle wacky old tom bombadil  was dealt with by simple excision but the ents are too central to the story to omit its perfectly possible to read the lord of the rings believing in treebeard without ever having visualised him is he an anthropomorphic tree or a dendromorphic man there are a controlled number of humorous situations in this mostly very grim film but any whiff of whimsy or silliness like a fart at high mass would swiftly dispel the magic so its a relief to report that striding creaking treebeard with his archimboldo face composed of boles and mosses is a satisfying creation comical in his slowness but also wise and frightening that tolkienian note of holy awe mixed with rustic humour is very hard to pull off though the action in this second part of the trilogy moves decisively towards the world of men the many ways of being nothuman are fully explored problems of visualisation aside the fundamental question at this halfway point is whether the director peter jackson can create an artistic whole out of the middle of the sandwich will the magnificent filling pressed on both sides by the great crusts of the quest begins and the quest is ended just seem shapeless no the film is triumphant on its own terms the narrative has an unstoppable forward thrust  its not just a question as in the harry potter sequel of returning to a place we know and renewing our acquaintance with the strange folk there the sundered fellowship split into three pushes like a trident deeper into new and dangerous territory for the first half of the original book the reader is left in the dark about the fate of sam and frodo they have disappeared from the text and from our ken and when they next appear they seem isolated and scared jackson opts for a less daring more conventionally cinematic way of telling the story cutting rapidly between all three segments at once this was perhaps an inevitable choice and it certainly gives the action a reassuring narrative flow but the effect is to leach much of the despair and loneliness out of the hobbits quest tolkiens great skill is to make you think no matter how many times you reread his book that perhaps this time it wont work out after all the message of the second book is there is no hope but lets try anyway and jackson is faithful to this but the whambam style of epic works against him jackson makes other artistic choices at variance with the book but they rarely feel like violations most of them make you reassess the story draw your attention to unnoticed subtleties a few of the characters seem even richer more profound than tolkiens own conception viggo mortensen finds an astonishing stillness and poise at the heart of aragorn hes a bit of a stiff in the novel this deep love of peace is what drives him to fight a paradox which makes him more kinglike than any other character in brief divergence from the book hes reunited in memory or dream with arwen is liv tylers spadelike face actually getting longer with each instalment this lovely interlude softens the character redresses an awkwardness in tolkien and breaks up the relentless militarism elijah wood frodo is visibly losing life force as the quest continues drooping swooning a spooked and spooky figure gollum is a wonderful creation voiced by andy serkis and given the most heartbreakingly expressive face hes far more than a digital effect hes really there taking up space displacing air part of the impact comes from the meticulous care with which all the creatures of middle earth are scaled relative to one another gollum is a vile mixture of servility and malice yet watching him being beaten throttled kicked by almost everyone he encounters is as distressing as watching a child being hit frodo for all his faults is kind to gollum seeing in him his own disturbing likeness sam for all his virtues is cruel gollum has been corrupted by his precioussss but jackson strikes an almost theological note in suggesting that his selfcentred inability to forgive is really whats corroding him there are several hazards which jackson avoids this episode with its histrionic battle scenes and viking fetishism middle earth having a simultaneous bad hair day could have degenerated into a heavy metal video aesthetic as it is only faramirs shaggy perm seriously enters spinal tap territory another error would have been to make this a kind of postmodern potpourri of cinematic injokes when aragorn  missing presumed very dead  turns up late for a battle all legolas orlando bloom says is youre late that this hoary old line is delivered in elvish redeems it gimli is reduced to a comic character  theres another discussion of when its permissible to toss a dwarf  but theres otherwise nothing camp or arch to leaven the tense moral seriousness the two towers is a satisfying and wholly gripping drama in its own right inevitably januslike it looks back to the shire and forward to the hour of doom and after three hours you will too
Nov 19 2013,positive, as the opening credits of 2003 begin to roll two big thunderers are slugging it out chicago is a musical and the lord of the rings the two towers is three hours of epic the garter belt is to one film what the horned helmet is to the other although i shall not slake your curiosity by revealing which is which both films are to be commended for venturing into genres that were until recently viewed as dilapidated vacant and overpriced all we need now is the return of the religious barnstormer and the revival will be complete even as we speak ben affleck may be combing his beard for the leading role of jonah with nathan lane as the whale chicago stars catherine zetajones as velma kelly and renée zellweger as roxie hart each is a mankiller and each resides in jail plotting her defense with the silken legal help of billy flynn richard gere the time is i would guess the late nineteentwenties although the setting is so stylized so shamelessly grounded in a hundred other shows and films that chicago barely qualifies as a period piece indeed it merrily jabs at the celebritylust of our own era in the strongest and most biting number roxie perches on billys lap like a dummylimbs turned to sticks spots of red on her rounded cheeksand chants the melodies that he the attorney as ventriloquist feeds into her mouth behind them the ladies and gentlemen of the press jerk on wires yanked from on high by a second billy and compete to do his bidding as a musical demonstration of spin it couldnt be meaner the only hitch is that i cannot for the life of me name that tune the songs in chicago crash in one ear barge around your brain for a minute or two then make a swift exit through the other ear never to be heard again this may mark me as a rodgers and hammerstein junkie but i cant help feeling that the fustiness lies with kander and ebb whose music and lyrics operate on the oldfashioned principle that every song should be a showstopper regardless of whether the show deserves to be stopped as i left the movie my skull was humming more than i was much violence is perpetrated in the course of the plot as each of the jailbirds recounts her capital offense but the real harm is done to the senses of the people in the audience who will find themselves in the unusual position of being snarled up in fishnets and assaulted by sequins is there anything in art or in life less sexy than the incorrigible twentyfourhour desire to trumpet ones sexiness to the world we are meant to be blown away by the sultry airs of this picture but the very surfeit of them spoils the plan when cyd charisse laid an endless leg across the screen in the broadway ballet sequence of singin in the rain or when she and fred astaire offered a tribute to mickey spillane in the band wagon we understood that the hardboiled style was already a soft target and that the landscape of gumshoes pimps and dames with louise brooks hair styles had become a nice pliable gag for choreographers yet here comes chicago almost half a century later kitting its heroine out with a black bob and inviting us to take our randy noir straight up rob marshall the director does his best to leave the stage show behind but the cards are stacked against him for chicago is a pack of theatrical tricks whether its the towering grid of prison bars or the huge red roxie that flashes behind renée zellweger we sense a flatness of dimension a reluctance to stretch the storys depth of field what marshall does by way of compensation is to edit his way out of trouble cutting away furiously during not only each song but almost every line of each song as though not daring to presume that younger viewers will be able to stomach more than four and a half seconds of inviolate music this is hectic on the eye and bad for the confidence we start to wonder ungallantly about the cameras chronic wish to glance asidecould it be that the performers might not weather its unstinting gaze a headon scene of gene kelly tapdancing is bliss but the same view of richard gere is not kind this is hardly geres fault no skill is more baffling than taphow can the staccato turn largo and liquid like that gere also strips to his underwear whether he does this in the interests of gender equality or whether for a practicing buddhist it is an established spiritual technique for paring life down to its essentials i am not qualified to judge the only player to conquer chicago is catherine zetajones who is no charisse in her motions but who gets by on a full tank of unleaded oomph the film is hard however on renée zellweger if there is any living star who could strap herself into heels like scalpels and then strut and bray all by her lonesome against a background of inky black with the camera hunkered down ringside so that it can peer up her shimmering nanodress i cant name her many people will get off on the highs of this picture but they might want to ask why there are no other levels musicals depend on the contest of innocence and experience and we are just not culturally equipped to provide that mix anymore lovers of the classic form were prepared to believe that it was naturalmore of a thirsty emotional need than a luxuryfor a character to break into song whereas nowadays that perversity has to be explained most of the numbers in chicago are meant to unfurl within roxies imagination and even then you can hear the grinding gear change as the action readies itself for a tune i admire the punch of this movie but not for a second as the dancers wriggled and raged did i get that delicious redeeming sense that life can be lived on the hoof once you have clambered over the craggy title the lord of the rings the two towers is a fairly easy ride never in three hours did i look at my watch nor cast my eyes toward the sun as it westered unto the havens of eriador around me rose a few clucks from confirmed tolkienites frustrated at the loss of a favorite line from the novel were the movie to map every detail of the masters work though the result would not be three hours long it would be three years long in the event the director peter jackson has crunched and tidied the book hundreds of pages pass for example in which the author allots so much space to gimli a dwarf legolas an elf and aragorn a real man that we all but forget about frodo and sam the hobbits bearing the ring to its doomin a volcano handily named mount doom which must make it easy to ask for directions onscreen jackson braids the two strands together adding the tale of fellowhobbits merry and pippin who in a twist guaranteed to make environmentalists spill their carrot juice for joy are literally hugged by trees we also get flying dragons a breathless opening sequence in which gandalf ian mckellen plummets down a belching abyss and a flawless white horse that if you give a little whistle gallops in from nowhere though only in slow motion and lo the name of this steed is shadowfax or as it was told in the olden tongue palmpilot then there is gollum gollum who guides frodo on his quest is whiteskinned and blueveined like a moldering cheese and his shrunken frame is topped by a triangular head with protruding eyes think of ross perot after ten years on the atkins diet and youre almost there there are two problems with gollum who used to be known as sméagol before he entered the witnessprotection program first he gives the movie a chance for psychological inquirythe one thing it doesnt require the lord of the rings is an epic and one of the defining restrictionsnot to say pleasuresof epic is that it both predate and outwit psychology motives good and ill may be thwarted or confounded but you dont read tolkien for the niceties of tangled minds you read him for pace and wonder and the virtues of jacksons trilogy thus far have been pace and astonishment which is almost the same thing second gollum was forged on computer and planted inside the frame nobody could quibble with the vitality of the result but theres the rubhis creators are so pleased with their baby that they cant help showing him off and we get far more of his hisses and writhings than we need this is a pity and we may have to accept that for those fooling around with brandnew technologies the toys are simply too much fun when you are the kind of exuberant artist as jackson is who visualizes a giant tree that can both walk the walk and talk the talk you can hardly be blamed if in the deepest sense you end up rooting for it by signing up you agree to our

Nov 19 2013,positive, last years the fellowship of the ring director peter jacksons first entry in his threepart adaptation of jrr tolkiens the lord of the rings provided little cause for complaint at once thoroughly cinematic and faithful to the spirit if not always the letter of tolkiens book it presented middle earth as an immersive experience a world in which every aspect is realized in minute detail fellowship made the impossible believable and without draining the magical happenings fantastical locations and uncanny creatures of their wonder it also never abandoned a sense of dramatic and thematic weight as embodied by a wellchosen cast fellowships characters had all the depth tolkien gave them on the page and sometimes more and their quest to rid the world of a ring of absolutely corrupting power took on greater urgency as the film progressed toward a cliffhanger that set up its second part to live up to expectations the two towers only had to be as good as its predecessorand astoundingly its better thats not simply a matter of exposition giving way to action although the film has plenty as soulful hobbits elijah wood and sean astin make their way toward mordor friends billy boyd and dominic monaghan find unlikely allies deep in a forest and the dwarfelfhuman team of john rhysdavies orlando bloom and viggo mortensen attempts to defend a struggling kingdom from the forces of christopher lee what makes towers so staggering is the way it brings the full scope of jacksons adaptation into focus without missing a beat in three hours the film shifts from epic to lyrical and back it portrays a harrowingly intense battle one moment then pauses for a fathers grief over his sons death the next it shows in frightening detail the engines of war then links those engines to the bloodshed they exact and the ecological destruction that made them possible what fellowship suggested towers elucidates its thrilling as swords clash and arrows fly but it also never abandons the underlying sadness of tolkiens world in which each victory only forestalls the transition to a meaner age and for all the attendant technophobia its another technical masterpiece gollum voiced by andy serkis may qualify as the first fully fleshedout performance by a cgi effect next year the return of the king will bring the story to a close until then it feels almost like a privilege to watch the unfolding of a tale from a fantastic imagined past rich with resonance for the human present 
Nov 19 2013,positive, the lord of the rings the two towers fits this pattern taking frodo baggins into territory more frightening than anything he encountered in the fellowship of the ring last year the two towers was made at the same time and woven from the same cloth as the other chapters in peter jacksons ambitious rings project the similarity of the three movies  the third opens next winter  will disappoint viewers looking for something different each time but it ensures huge dividends for the filmmakers now that the first installment has proved an overthetop hit with worldwide grosses of 860 million to date i found fellowship of the ring pale compared with the imaginative sweep of tolkiens books few readers agreed with me  you should see the angry mail i got  so im pleased to report that the two towers is better one reason is gollum who dogs frodos trail because of his obsession with the magical ring frodo is taking to mordor so it can be destroyed before sauron uses it to dominate middle earth forever gollum is treacherous and wicked but hes also weak and pitiable jackson evokes these contradictory traits through one of the most ingenious computergenerated characters yet created theres no need for the ponderous exposition that weighed down the first installment since the filmmakers assume weve seen it they give towers a snappier ending too straining less hard to make it seem like both a single installment and a complete story in itself the flat dialogue doesnt give the actors much to work with but liv tyler and ian mckellen make strong impressions and then theres gollum voiced by andy serkis whose live performance was the basis for the computer graphics most moviegoers will leave buzzing about the climactic battle of helms deep but in my eyes this is gollums show more than anyone elses even the specialeffects wizards behind the scenes
Nov 19 2013,positive,the battle for gollums mind also provides a fitting teaser conclusion to the second act of a story im beginning to wish would never end
Nov 19 2013,positive,the two towers was always going to be the toughest book to adapt yet peter jackson pulls it off part two is easily as exciting involving and visually inventive as part one
Nov 19 2013,positive,its darker and more urgent than the opening segment and jackson again displays an unparalleled grasp of storytelling on a grand scale
Nov 19 2013,positive,lord of the rings the two towers is a pitchperfect second act full of dark wonder and the slow pounding pulse of aragorns unflagging hope
Nov 19 2013,negative,any sort of compelling story gets lost amidst all the spectacle
Nov 19 2013,positive,part two is more a straightahead action flick substituting brawn and brawling for the pastoral radiance of the first film
Dec 9 2012,positive,marches along with considerably more assurance and smoothness than the desperately crammed fellowship
Sep 13 2012,positive, the aristocats 1970  the rescuers 1977  the rescuers down under 1990  pocahontas 1995 before the disastrous aughts was there a worse decade for disney animated features than the 1970s even the relatively bare 60s had the marvelous 101 dalmatians to elevate its average and the 1980s was largely saved by the lastminute appearance of 1989s the little mermaid which of course launched a new golden age of disney classics the 70s began with the aristocats a limp lady and the tramp reworking that finds eva gabor voicing the pampered duchess and phil harris speaking for the streetsavvy omalley duchess and her kittens will inherit the fortune of their wealthy owner after she passes away a development that leads the womans butler to get rid of the felines so that he will inherit as the secondary beneficiary omalley and his band of jazzplaying alley cats come to their rescue as do assorted other animals but except for a pair of country hounds named napoleon and lafayette these critters are alternately irritating a mouse two geese or downright dull a horse the evrybody wants to be a cat sequence is a showstopper and the butlers runins with the dawgs are amusing but this is otherwise forgettable stuff ill go ahead and acknowledge that im probably in the minority when it comes to the rescuers a sizable box office success all over the world  it reportedly made more than the same years star wars in some countries  its since been a popular seller on vhs and dvd and will likely fare well on bluray as well yet the movie moves like molasses as the heroic mice bernard voiced by bob newhart and bianca eva gabor again square off against the fearsome madame medusa geraldine page in order to rescue the orphan girl penny from her clutches theres some colorful action set in the aptly named devils bayou and i dug the character of evinrude the dragonfly but the songs arent up to par nevertheless someones waiting for you earned a best original song oscar nomination madame medusa comes off as a cutrate cruella de vil no surprise since the 101 dalmatians villainess was at one point discussed for this picture and newharts bernard ranks as one of disneys dullest toon protagonists the rescuers was the first disney toon flick to inspire a sequel and the good news is that the rescuers down under is better than its predecessor here bernard and bianca travel to australia to rescue a boy whos being held captive by a poacher intent on nailing an eagle that the lad has befriended the films aussie setting unusual for an animated film adds some interest as do the spirited vocal characterizations by george c scott as the ruthless poacher and john candy as a friendly albatross although it was released in the year between the little mermaid and beauty and the beast its never been considered part of the disney renaissance and its limp box office helped convince the studio to release all future sequels straight to the home market alongside all these underachievers disney has thankfully chosen to release one winner to bluray pocahontas tells the story of the reallife native american heroine voiced by irene bedard with judy kuhn handling the songs and her fictionalized romance with british sea captain john smith mel gibson if nothing else the movie features my alltime favorite disney tune the gorgeous oscarwinning colors of the wind at once timeless in its hopeful theme of harmony among all creatures as well as with nature itself and timely the line you think the only people who are people are the people who think and look like you should be the catchphrase for every republican national convention yet the movie has other virtues as well an oscarwinning score by alan menken and stephen schwartz ofttimes staggering animation and appreciated but not obtrusive comic relief from a mischievous raccoon named meeko the aristocats is sold individually while the rescuers and the rescuers down under are paired in one set pocahontas unfortunately shares its edition with the 1998 straighttovideo sequel pocahontas ii journey to a new world bluray extras on the aristocats include the deleted song she never felt alone a piece on songwriters robert and richard sherman a music video for oui oui marie and the minnie mouse cartoon bath day bluray extras on the rescuers twofer include the deleted song peoplitis a rescuers down under makingof featurette the liveaction short water birds and the animated short the three blind mouseketeers bluray extras on pocahontas include the deleted song if i never knew you deleted scenes a featurette on the music and the animated short little hiawatha battleship 2012 this massively budgeted heavily hyped and supremely awful summer flop could easily be mistaken for a transformers sequel except that its missing shia labeoufs distinct hairdo peter berg who used to be a mediocre actor before morphing into a mediocre director apparently wants to be the new michael bay oh for a time when filmmakers looked up to hitchcock and hawks instead and i guess give him credit for succeeding with awful dialogue dull characterizations and snoozeinducing visual effects  yeah im not so proud that i cant admit to uncharacteristically dozing off for a few minutes during one of the endless battle sequences  battleship is the sort of mindless mayhem thats defended by fans as perfect popcorn entertainment sure if you like your popcorn burnt and sticking to the bag but to tag this a worthy blockbuster is the equivalent of spitting in the faces of steven spielberg robert zemeckis james cameron or any other filmmaker who used to expertly do this sort of thing on a regular basis a virtual remake of last years pisspoor battle los angeles this adds aliens to the board game template with our military might going up against dastardly ets bent on destroying the world  or more importantly the american way of life battleship was a massive bomb at the us box office it did just fine internationally but it might fare better at home since its jingoistic nonsense that shamelessly panders to every demographic  teen boys will ogle at the special effects and at former charlottean brooklyn decker young women will dig hunks taylor kitsch and alexander skarsgard playing unlikely brothers rb fans will be excited at the prospect of rihanna making her film debut the verdict meh and older viewers who should know better will feel all warm and fauxpatriotic when the film drags out geriatric naval officers to help fight the invaders as far as i know this is only the second movie thats been based on a board game with clue having paved the way back in 1985 lets hope they wait another 27 years before bringing a third one to the screen  itll take that long to mentally prepare myself for a celluloid take on hungry hungry hippos or parcheesi bluray extras include video commentary by berg an alternate ending previsualization a featurette on the visual effects looks at shooting at sea and on the uss missouri a tour of the uss missouri and a short piece on the cast bernie 2012 bernie finds jack black playing the same type of character essayed by zach galifianakis in the campaign a friendly respectable and slightly effeminate southerner whos greatly admired by those around him the difference though is that the campaign is a fictional piece while bernie is based on a true story working from a texas monthly article by skip hollandsworth director richard linklater reteams with his the school of rock star for this quirky piece about bernie tiede a mortician residing in the town of carthage texas bernies method of treating everyone with courtesy and respect extends to marjorie nugent shirley maclaine a loathsome widow with no friends but lots of material wealth bernie strikes up a friendship or something more with the elderly woman and they soon become inseparable which is fine until bernie starts to feel more like marjories possession than her bff but does he emotionally break down enough to kill her in a second of spontaneous and regrettable rage or was he planning to murder her all along so that he may enjoy her riches the sympathetic townspeople opt for the former the local district attorney matthew mcconaughey votes for the latter writing the screenplay with hollandsworth linklater uses dollops of black humor to provide an edge to this morally ambiguous piece that asks viewers to weigh not only whether one awful deed can overshadow a lifetime of charitable service but also whether there was any appropriate punishment that would suit this particular crime this is assuming the reallife bernie is as likable as his celluloid counterpart as filmed linklater is clearly on his side maclaine and mcconaughey are only required to strike the same note repeatedly grouchy and grandstanding respectively but black is excellent in the central role incidentally the real bernie tiede pops up during the closing credits bluray extras include a behindthescenes featurette deleted scenes a piece on the truelife story that inspired the film and a look at the carthage residents through interviews and audition pieces the fiveyear engagement 2012 it would be both obnoxious and inaccurate to quip that the fiveyear engagement feels as if it runs as long as the titular length but theres no denying that this is one movie that would have benefitted from some judicious trimming in the editing room at 125 minutes the latest comedy from the director nicholas stoller star jason segel and producer who else but judd apatow of the superior forgetting sarah marshall doesnt sound especially long  its the exact same running time as the apatowproduced bridesmaids which was the perfect length yet by unleashing most of its best gags during the first act and by sprinkling its dramatic moments around like a sous chef adding just a soupcon of parsley to an order of grilled trout that leaves plenty of time for the film to develop a noticeable sag around the middle speaking of sous chefs thats the role essayed by segel he plays tom solomon a highly respected member of san franciscos culinary scene his girlfriend is violet barnes emily blunt and its only after he pops the question that violet is beckoned to the university of michigan for a postdoctoral position deciding to put his own career on hold while she builds hers tom agrees with violet that they should postpone the wedding for two years and move to ann arbor tom who can only find work at a deli hates living there and when it looks like the two years might stretch into something longer he loses it in rather imaginative fashion the late film critic pauline kael famously said of the popular fred astaireginger rogers pairing he gave her class and she gave him sex in this film blunt provides both the class and the sex but segel nevertheless brings enough easygoing charisma and sly wit to the table to make them a believable screen couple while this is evident in the scenes in which they make doe eyes at each other its crucially also identifiable in the sequences in which their characters are at odds with each other theres a terrific bit in which the two argue in bed replete with the sort of acidic asides frustrated exchanges and oddly understandable oxymorons i want to be alone  with you here  a great line that spring from real life scenes like this make the lowbrow moments even more unworthy of inclusion here whether its the sight of violet getting walloped by an opening car door or the increasingly tedious banter between violets colleagues at the university if they had kept all the drama and halved the humor the fiveyear engagement would have truly distinguished itself as it stands its engaging but hardly revelatory the bluray includes both the pg13 theatrical version and an unrated cut extras include audio commentary by stoller segel blunt costars chris pratt and alison brie and producer rodney rothman a makingof featurette deleted scenes extended and alternate scenes and a gag reel la grande illusion 1937 in the latest edition of the decennial sight  sound poll this jean renoir classic placed 73rd on the list of the alltime greatest films even securing top10 standing on the individual lists submitted by woody allen mike newell and a few other participants such reverential treatment is nothing new of course back in 1952 both orson welles you know that citizen kane guy and david lean you know that lawrence of arabia helmer cited the movie as one of their 10 alltime favorite films still not everyone was a fan joseph goebbels hitlers ratfaced minister of propaganda declared it cinematic public enemy no 1 and ordered all available prints destroyed further wwii shenanigans resulted in the belief that the original negative was lost requiring renoir to use inferior stock for a 1958 release what no one knew at the time was that the original was safely stored in a russian vault and it wasnt until it made its trip back to its native france where it sat unnoticed for years that it was finally rereleased at its initial length 113 minutes as opposed to the widely distributed 94minute cut in 1999 as part of its studiocanal collection lionsgate has now released it on bluray in a pristine edition sure to delight cinephiles across the country set during world war i the film focuses on three french soldiers  the workingclass lieutenant marechal jean gabin the jewish middleclass lieutenant rosenthal dalio and the aristocratic captain de boeldieu dita parlo  who get captured and spend time in a pair of german prison camps the second of these prisons is overseen by captain von rauffenstein erich von stroheim commanding in both senses of the word who feels a special kinship with his upperclass equal de boeldieu so beautifully realized and deeply felt that its title can mean different things to different people for starters the grand illusion can be that war solves anything that the wellbred aristocracy will survive such a brutal conflict or that the lines that divide classes races and countries can ever be erased the movie pushes renoirs humanist views without having to resort to any manufactured sentiment or cheap theatrics in short its as honest as it is humbling la grande illusion became the first foreignlanguage film to be nominated for the best picture academy award in modern times it has the distinction of being the very first title released by the prestigious criterion collection on dvd in 1999 yet its this beautifully restored bluray edition that will doubtless remain the definitive home edition bluray extras include a piece in which renoir expert olivier curchod discusses the films history and controversy a discussion about the movie with film professor and critic ginette vincendeau a featurette on the remarkable tale behind the discovery of the original negative a look at the restoration and the theatrical trailers from 1937 and 1958 the lord of the rings motion picture trilogy extended editions 20012003 last summer saw the bluray debut of the extended editions of the lord of the rings trilogy in one massive box set so now we get the inevitable release of the movies individually of course given the lengths of the films and the ample amount of extra features accompanying each title that still translates into a fivedisc edition per feature between a mountain of critical raves a 314 million box office haul and 13 oscar nominations resulting in four wins the colossal success of the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring 2001 initially caught even ardent admirers of jrr tolkiens literary trilogy off guard after having filmed all three parts of the trilogy in one fell swoop an enormous risk on the part of new line cinemas director peter jackson got things off to a roaring start with a fantasy flick that pleased both fans and novices alike even those who havent read the books are doubtless familiar with the sagas basic thrust  noble middleearth denizens must destroy a powerful ring before it falls into the hands of an evil warlord  but to their credit jackson and his coscripters kick things off with a helpful prologue that nicely sets up the story from there jackson juggles a daunting array of conflicts and characters ian mckellen as the wizard gandalf is the cast standout and its to his credit that the saga leaves viewers panting for more the lord of the rings the two towers 2002 doesnt quite match the majesty of its predecessor though thats hardly meant as a knock against a rousing farreaching spectacle of unlimited ambition but whereas fellowship did a nice job of balancing quieter moments with the bombast this actionpacked installment often treats its expository scenes as asides too many good actors  mckellen cate blanchett miranda otto  are given the short shrift in this outing whats more the movie doesnt deepen or expand the tales themes as masterfully as the empire strikes back added to star wars mystique but as a stirring story of unsullied heroism its a winner and as an action epic it features some of the best battle sequences of recent vintage and while the campaign to win a best supporting actor oscar nomination for andy serkis voicing the cgicreated gollum proved to be a fizzle he turns out to be the best special effect in a movie crammed with them this was the oscar weakling of the bunch earning two awards out of six nominations although no one at new line was complaining about its sizable 341 million gross pulling off a successful threepeat jackson wraps up tolkiens fantasy saga with the lord of the rings the return of the king 2003 a dazzling chapter that outgrossed its predecessors 377 million domestically and over one billion internationally and led to oscar overkill when the myopic academy handed it 11outof11 awards four or five would have been more reasonable including best picture with the heftiest running time of all three extended editions this installment is long but not necessarily overlong  even the battle sequences have been executed with more focus and clarity than those in two towers the supersized length also allows several members of the large cast to strut their stuff and several new creatures from an army of ghostly marauders to a gigantic spider in the best harryhausen tradition are staggering to behold ultimately though this final act belongs to the ringbearer and his equally diminutive companions the odyssey of the hobbit frodo elijah wood his faithful companion sam sean astin and the treacherous gollum contains the true heart of the film evoking all sorts of emotions as we watch each player constantly forced to make painful decisions and struggle with their own tortured psyches this is a movie of expensive visual effects and expansive battle scenes but when it comes to truly making its mark we have to thank all the little people the sound and picture quality on the dvds were so spectacular that is this blasphemy i enjoyed the series even more at home than in the theater  on the big screen this ambitious undertaking occasionally felt distant but on disc it exuded more warmth coming off as the best miniseries never made on bluray the sights are even more astounding and the sound is equally fantastic better check the living room wall for fissures after cranking this baby in addition to the extended cuts of all three pictures running around four hours apiece each fivedisc set also includes hours of bonus material roughly seven hours on fellowship nine on towers and 10 on king notable among the inclusions are the muchballyhooed behindthescenes documentaries created by costa botes who was given complete set access by jackson other extras include four separate audio commentaries on each film over 30 participants including jackson and most of the principal cast members 44 featurettes covering practically every aspect of production except for catering and that might be buried in there somewhere interactive maps of middleearth and photo galleries containing over 4000 images
Dec 9 2011,positive,the two towers then is the greatest blockbuster ever made without either a beginning or an end a feisty beast with a hollow ring in its bones
Jun 21 2011,positive, the second chapter of peter jacksons landmark epic the lord of the rings the two towers differs in narrative and tone from the first one the fellowship of the ring in this middle segment the emphasis is more on battles and action setpieces than on plot or character development  the two towers impressive as it is technically feels like a middle chapter mediating between the protags of the first film and the events they would encounter in the third and last one in their parallel journeys the fellowship stands against the powerful forces spreading from the two towers orthanc tower in isengard where saruman has bred a lethal army of 10000 strong and saurons fortress at baraddûr deep within the dark lands of mordor in mood and visuals the two towers is darker and more somber than fellowship of the ring plunging frodo elijah wood and sam sean astin into an environment of war and waste frodo must destroy the malevolent ring of power in the burning area of mount doom before it falls into evil hands  gollum voiced by andy serkis who had once possessed the ring offers to guide them meanwhile the band is split and fellow hobbits merry dominic monaghan and pippin

May 7 2011,positive,an army of filmmakers led by the director peter jackson has made the trilogys central section a ringing testament to the power of motion pictures
Sep 19 2010,positive, like hobbit protagonist frodo baggins wearing the hefty one ring around his neck on a quest to destroy it peter jackson no doubt struggled with the weight of fanboy expectations yet over the course of three films in 2001 2002 and 2003 and 10plus hours  longer on the richer fuller dvd directors cuts  jackson delivered soaring searing tales of wonderment with electric genre fencejumping moves that rank these films among the alltime greats an unflagging charge from the introductory first frame to the welcomehome last the lord of the rings is powered by burnished literary masterstrokes of heroism courage friendship betrayal love resolve and anger where jackson could have fallen from a precipice he instead presented a cumulatively careerdefining work of greatness the worlds of men dwarves elves and hobbits furry short folk are threatened by the reemergence of the one ring  sought by the evil lord sauron who would use it to overrun the land with creatures from the bowels of the world in the fellowship of the ring a small group is entrusted to journey across middleearth and destroy the ring by tossing it into the fires of mount doom  easier said than done fellowship bears well the burden of exposition and character introduction and also introduces two of the series numerous action setpieces both set in the dank mines of moria battles against a cave troll and the viciously inflammatory balrog arent just visualeffects reels but trials by fire of the camaraderie among this band of brothers the two towers  tracking the group as it has been severed and scattered  balances a rainy prolonged battle for helms deep a crucial outpost with frodo elijah wood and friend samwises sean astin struggle for possession of the one ring with the duplicitous gollum driven to madness by the rings powers what was once known as smeagol transformed into the amphibious murderous gollum andy serkiss work in creating gollum  he acted alongside wood and astin with movements fed into a computer to animate the character  deserved an honorary academy award his gestures and voice not computer software made gollum so memorable as he wrestled with his inner homicidal maniac avoiding the ineffective conclusion jinx the return of the king set so many standards in its overwhelming epic wash that future attempts only seemed like pretenders to the throne even avatar as visionary as it could be owed a debt to jacksons scope here every location whether real or digitally enhanced is a jawdropping dazzler minas tirith resembles a fort as drawn by mc escher and its evil counterpart minas morgul looks like a demented sydney opera house lit by kryptonite it also allows supporting performers room for affecting arcs  billy boyd and dominic monaghans pippin and merry grow from curious troublemakers to noble warriors who understand the consequences of their choices plus astin delivers a performance of galeforce emotions watching his lifelong friend teeter on the edge of madness and death its centerpiece  the rousing defense of minas tirith  is all it was billed to be the battle to end all battles jackson takes us to the battlefields blades of grass with meticulous detail amid all the chaos you feel the swath cut by charging woolly mammothtype beasts and the swift divebomb attacks of saurons flying minions kings patient conclusion became a popculture punchline but it certainly earns this extended epilogue after hours spent with so many richly drawn characters  not just frodo samwise pippin merry and gollum but ian mckellens compassionate wizard gandalf viggo mortensens swashbuckling rogue aragorn and john rhysdavies gimli a fearless dwarf who learns tolerance in wartime  why wouldnt jackson strive to give each one a fitting emotional sendoff although new line the trilogys financing studio wound up folding after wasting its rings profit on a passel of expensive projects jackson plans to return to middleearth this decade hes producing and now possibly directing a twopart prequel with the hobbit to be released annually a la rings
Mar 23 2010,positive,gollum and the battles are a triumph of integrated art and technology and the battles a masterstroke of sheer logistics extended edition
Apr 29 2009,positive,to say that this is a great movie would be an understatement
Apr 29 2008,positive,glorious escapism that will not make you feel dirty the morning after
Mar 5 2008,positive,more graphic in its violence and more fantastic in its imaginings than the first film
Dec 7 2007,positive, less direct and coherent than its predecessor but wider in scope jacksontolkeins difficult second movie just about manages to get away with it all and there are times when it provides a rollicking good adventure i would recommend that the parents of young children go to see it themselves before escorting their offspring as it is extremely violent and gruesome in places echoing the directors earlier work and there are moments which are genuinely scary a rare thing in fantasy cinema the darker story is somehow more satisfying however as were now dealing with characters who begin to understand what theyre about instead of being frustratingly albeit charmingly delusional so we can tackle the issues of war and conquest head on here are the battles only hinted at in the first film here is action where before there was only angst here is peter jackson in his element vigorous and inventive grabbing ones attention and holding onto it through long complex scenes of conflict there are brilliantly visualised war machines intriguing tactical manouvers blood and gore flynnstyle fighting from the ballettrained orlando bloom as legolas and properly disgusting bloodthirsty urukhai despite all this much of the tweeness of the first story still lingers most notably in the tale of merry and pippin whose forest adventures do drag slowing everything down though this may satisfy those who insist that the greatest virtue such a movie might have is faithfulness to its source clever photography provides cinematic references to the work of hg wells both in the recurring comparison of the urukhai to morlocks who are not treated altogether without sympathy and in the demonstration of evil industry destroyed by natural forces this latter part is a bit heavyhanded a legacy of a cruder political age when the first world war on which so much of tolkeins fable is based helped to give birth to the new age movement but jackson deftly steers away from the absolute condemnation of technological progress which has become a staple of modern fantasy the real frustration at this point is simply that christopher lee as saurman really doesnt get enough to do the standout performances in this film come once again from elijah wood as the increasingly troubled frodo and from the computeranimated gollum whose pathetic splitpersonality soliloquies manage to be at once ridiculous pitiful and sinister the interplay of these two characters presents an unusually astute study of the mechanics of addiction and has the sort of realworld relevance which all really good fantasy strives to accomplish although frodo and gollum and sam travelling with them dont actually do very much they remain fascinating to watch perhaps the greatest weakness of this story is that aside from those final battles nobody really does very much at least not in comparison to the amount of soulsearching strategic meandering and general arsing about its hard to care about a king as useless as theoden despite effective borrowings from lear wormtongue comes across as altogether too crude and obvious to be disturbing eowyns fight to be allowed to fight as she is able is affecting but sidelined and aragorns angst about his love for arwen with liv tyler still more wooden than the ents gets tediously drippy despite some beautiful gothic photography the new zealand landscape is still stunning but less exciting this time sauron somehow doesnt seem as mighty as he should if i go to see this film a second time i shall take a different book because there are passages within it which really are dull but there are also parts which i rather think i might enjoy watching hundreds of times the bittiness of the whole can be forgiven on account of their brilliance the wargs are well realised and really scary its exciting to see gandalf reveal how capable he really is and the growing rapport between gimli and legolas makes it easier to care about these disparate characters the set piece involving the flood is one of the most impressive uses of special effects ive ever seen a really hard thing to get right and it sweeps one away the nazghul remain intensely creepy frodos fall is heartbreaking and of course gollum gets the last word this film is not altogether satisfying but youd be an idiot to miss it
Aug 13 2007,positive, even though i was lost through some of it i liked the lord of the rings the two towers better than its predecessor the fellowship of the ring as the middle section of what is really one long story or one long ninehour movie it doesnt bother setting anything up  it assumes youve seen the first one  and just plunges in whereas fellowship gave us the sunlit complacency of the shire darkening into grim duty two towers begins on a note of neardisaster  a dream of the standoff between the wizard gandalf ian mckellen and the fearsome balrog  and mostly keeps its jaws clenched in readiness for hopeless battle the theme of this act two is good warriors standing tall in the face of odds that could hardly suck worse if that sounds like a downer it isnt peter jackson delivering the second of his three christmas gifts to jrr tolkien fans worldwide comes most alive during the scenes of peril and evil of which there are enough here for a years worth of movies one could conceivably enjoy the two towers knowing very little of its conflicts or interspecies politics it can be processed as pure cinema and forget about the plotlines which in any event are unavoidably way stations to the return of the king we do spend a great deal of the movie watching characters prepare for things that wont happen in the movie even the bigbang sequence the battle at helms deep is but a minor skirmish in the grand scheme of things a good deal of the dawdling is fun the fearful comicrelief hobbits merry dominic monaghan and pippin billy boyd find themselves hanging on a massive walking and talking tree  an ent really a sort of plant elemental that watches over the green these ents talk slowly and arrive at decisions even more slowly jackson seems to be tweaking the ponderousness of most epics meanwhile the human warrior aragorn viggo mortensen tries to get the woefully unprepared kingdom of rohan ready for legions of merciless urukhai sent by the evil wizard saruman christopher lee and frodo baggins elijah wood bearer of tolkiens mystical mcguffin the one ring and his loyal friend samwise sean astin slouch towards mordor to dispose of the thing accompanied by the wretched gollum most of the hype surrounding two towers has centered on helms deep and gollum of the two  and the battle is one of the best of its kind in film history a symphony of bloodlust and hopes dashed and restored  i prefer the little creature who used to be called smeagol before the ring stole his mind and soul as youve heard gollum is played in voice and gesture by andy serkis and fleshed out digitally by jacksons computer wizards youll always be aware that gollum isnt literally real but in his pathetically addled way hes more real than anyone else in the movie jackson seems to have studied jar jar binks and learned from george lucass mistake two towers may play narratively as a downer but jackson is too spirited a director to get bogged down characters are always reminding each other to keep hope alive in the midst of dread and panic hope is there too in the raw beauty jackson finds everywhere whether in battle or in a poetically downbeat episode at rivendell with a weeping arwen liv tyler jackson hasnt disdained his horrormovie roots either no director could be happier among the orcs and urukhai and he has the diabolical wit to end this second entry on a note of demented enthusiasm that functions as a chilling cliffhanger fellowship interested and entertained me this one hooked me
Jul 14 2007,positive,yes peter jackson demands nine hours of your time but i cant think of a director more deserving
Feb 9 2006,positive,in size and scale jackson has redefined the word epic  but his attention to the small things really gives this series its awesome stature
Sep 30 2005,positive,   and the masterpiece continues  with the two towers director peter jackson takes us one step further along the journey of the quest to destroy the one ring of power  as in the fellowship of the ring the world of middle earth is faithfully recreated and we are reimmersed in the world that jrr tolkien created in his literary classic   jumping immediately into the action from where we left off in the first installment the two towers hits the ground running and the action just never stops  having already established the situation and introduced the characters in the fellowship of the ring allows the plot to move along at a nice clip   more than the first movie the two towers differs from the book it is based upon  the most important difference being that the movie ends one chapter short of the last chapter of the book  this was the most shocking change because the book ends on a cliffhanger where the movie ending where it does really isnt one  instead it ends more at a moment where all of the characters are taking a breather a pause in the action so to speak   another change and this one is a good one is that where as the book is clearly divided into two books one covering sam frodo and gollum and the other covering the adventures of the rest of the fellowship with no cutting back and forth between the two in the movie the action is constantly cutting back and forth between the two  this definitely helps the tension and the sense that all this is happening at the same time   the best new part of this movie is the character of gollum who was only in the first one for a few moments  if they were to give an oscar for the best cgi character he would win it hands down  his schizophrenic conversations with himself are funny and touching at the same time  he is the first computer animated character in a movie i actually felt was fully rounded and actually evoked emotions in me   another stunning moment in a movie filled with stunning moments is the battle of helms deep  it is to fantasy battles what saving private ryans opening scene was to war movies  the attack of the orcs who swarm like ants against the castle defended by our heroes is nonstop action and visually brilliant   frankly this is one of those movies where a review is completely unnecessary  if you saw the fellowship of the ring and enjoyed it and how could you not then youll enjoy this movie  to put that another way if you have any taste at all then youll enjoy this movie  to put it one more way these three movies will stand the test of time they are already classics  there is no reason for you not to see this movie  it has action adventure romance great characters great villains fabulous sets special effects and anything else you could possible want  go see this movie   as scott said the second part of the lord of the rings trilogy continues the magic of the first the story grows more epic in scale and the cast of characters continues to increase the kingdoms of gondor and rohan are introduced as are the ents led by the wistful treebeard like in the first movie director peter jackson balances beautifully between faithfulness to the written word and small concessions to the celluloid reality of movie making   through the wonderful performance by elijah wood we see the rings effect on frodo growing stronger it is an addiction that has consumed gollum and now threatens the brave hobbit this arouses in frodo sympathy for the tortured soul once called smeagol they are like two junkies in rehab the one ring of power gives them a common bond that must be experienced to be understood   my favorite characters in the books were always gimli and legolas i love their contest to see who can kill the most orcs during the battle of helms deep   the brilliance of the story is in the minute details that are painted on such a vast and ambitious canvas at times we are standing back seeing the whole landscape with tiny figures running across the horizon and then seconds later we are privy to an intimate moment between characters we know like old friends   i cant wait to watch all three of them together they really are one long movie just as the books are really one long novel i think tolkien would approve   scott wrote that the movie hits the ground running not exactly yes most of the main characters are here so we do not need them introduced what scott did not mention is that many new characters get introduced so there are many dialogue scenes this movie really has no more or no less action than the first   this film does have one hell of a climactic battle it is however the last half hour of a three hour movie this battle alone is worth the price of the ticket actually my ticket was free i got it out of my dvd case of the fellowship of the ring anyway the battle is suspenseful and thrilling   aragorn legalos and gimli are the real focal point of this movie where as in the first movie the humor came from merry and pippin in this one it is from gimli when he cant see over the rampart or when he asks aragorn not to tell the elf that he had to toss him the relationship between these three characters is what made the movie for me   the weak part of this movie is the same as what i felt for the book the two towers seems like so much filler how many times do sam and frodo stand on a hill and look at mordor do they ever get any closer at one point gollum has them right at the gates of mordor a few scenes later they appear to be further away again remember in the first movie when gandalf first looks out over the country and sees the fires of mordor why couldnt gandalf just lend frodo his horse apparently he can get around a hell of a lot faster than these 2 hobbits   the only plot development this movie has with frodo is that we see him slowly succumbing to the weight of the ring one of the scariest things in the first movie is the nazgul they are back and they now ride on black dragons however they are completely underused and thus not at all threatening luckily we have the much more entertaining story of strider gimli and legalos to carry this movie
Jul 5 2005,positive, in the second installment of peter jacksons epic adaptation of jrr tolkiens the lord of the rings the franchise exceeds the majestic heights achieved a year ago by the first film of the series maintaining the commitment to cinematic beauty story and amazing special effects he established with    the fellowship of the      ring jackson once again gives stunning life to one of the finest stories ever written with the two towers   the film is divided into three subplots aragorn viggo mortensen legolas orlando bloom and gimli john rhysdavies continue their hunt of the nasty urukai tribes in their search to rescue merry and pippin dominic monaghan and billy boyd from the orcs who kidnapped them in the closing moments of fellowship merry and pippin meet a new friend in their quest to regroup with their comrades and sam sean astin stands by frodos elijah wood side in their burdensome journey to mordor where they meet the treacherous yet helpful gollum along the way all of this happens in the midst of a brewing battle between men and orcs at the rohan stronghold helms deep by far one of the most engaging and exciting battle sequences ever filmed    while comparing the two movies is unfair because they each were produced with different goals in mind two towers soars above fellowship as the better film probably due to the grander scale upon which it was made the cgi character gollum looks quite stunning as well at times resembling a human actor so closely that youll forget hes a computer creation    peter jackson upholds his credentials as a director staying true to tolkiens original work full of great battles complicated love stories and the strengthening ties of friendship while still incorporating the uniqueness he brings as a member of the lord of the rings team this second film is just as long as the first though and it doesnt quite finish the second book which leaves a lot of leftover work for the third and final film of this series in other words the wait for the return of the king will drag on even more painfully than the past year did  dvd review   for anyone who thought that the fourdisc extended editions  of the lord of the rings trilogy was the beall and endall of dvd releases  youre sadly mistaken the limited edition releases of the film deliver the definitive lotr experience sure they  dont have two extra discs worth of bonus material but who needs to sort  through all of that junk when the included documentary features everything you  could ever want produced by critically acclaimed documentary filmmaker costa  boates the three neverbeforeseen documentaries total just over five hours  and includes coverage on everything from production postproduction and even  a few onset antics with the castcrew also featured on the twodisc set for  the first time ever are both the theatrical and extended versions of the film  via seamless branching which makes this a nobrainer purchase for those who  currently own the original theatrical releases on dvd you can follow us on twitter and facebook for content updates also sign up for our email list for weekly updates and check us out on google as well
Mar 3 2005,negative,i began to wonder as the waves crashed about is it still possible for a movie to get excited about people
Jan 15 2005,positive, busing to work one morning last january i counted four commuters with their noses buried in copies of a book first published in 1954 j r r tolkiens perpetually popular epic the lord of the rings is more beloved than ever thanks to director peter jacksons shockinducing 2001 film the fellowship of the ring exhilarated by fellowships cliffhanger ending newcomers and old fans alike rushed to the books for resolution as they line up for the two towers some people may have an inkling that there is more to this mayhem than meets the eye tolkien the mythmaker knew that stories rooted in truth will endure in middle earth a world stripped down to essentials  earth fire water wood metal flesh spirit  we see our own dying world mirrored and clarified further we see reflections of gods grace christs sacrifice and the hope of resurrection such elemental plotting speaks to our longings evoking both sorrow and joy towers opens with a cliffhanger literally and when a hero falls an adrenaline rush begins that never lets up its getting heavier frodo says of the ring as the temperature rises fires of spiritual conflict that ignited in fellowship eventually explode into war hobbits merry and pippin abducted by orcs are pursued by three companions gimli the untossable dwarf legolas the elf and aragorn reluctant heir to the kingdom of men but these wouldbe rescuers are soon diverted to a different task king theoden needs help in saving his people before sarumans orcs lay waste to his kingdom their victory depends upon frodo the ringbearer who with samwise at his side wearily trudges across blasted mordor miles the ring draws villains from all directions gollum creeps up behind winged devils patrol the skies and saurons watchful eye never blinks dire straits indeed if this were a video game youd just hit start over filling out gollum  but for all its digital wizardry this is no game towers falls just short of fellowship as the finest film of its genre the scenery alone justifies the high price of your ticket designers alan lee and john howe continue to dazzle us with convincing creatures castles and environments battle scenes unsurpassed in scale and intensity inspire awe the performancesmost notably those of ian mckellen and viggo mortensen  are as intense as in the first film actor andy serkis collaborates with animators bringing vivid life to the vicious hissing gollum the film occasionally stumbles towers clearly posed a formidable challenge to its screenwriters fellowship followed a motley crew through trial and tribulation towers tracks three sets of charactersfour if you count sarumans behindthescenes meddling some stories gallop others only amble thus towers feels rushed and fragmented channelsurfing from plot to plot jackson complicates matters in fellowship he wisely pruned branches of plot to emphasize the ringbearers quest shoehorning enough story for a sixhour film into three this time he replaces important episodes with unnecessary tangents we lose our intimacy with major characters gandalf is too busy to chat merry and pippin get stranded too long on treebeards shoulders and gimli is reduced to punchlines fortunately hes hilarious treebeards folk seem lazy and naïve a far cry from tolkiens magisterial ents new villains fail to frighten as the cave troll balrog and black riders did in fellowship still concerned parents should be wary towers is more violent and monsterfilled than fellowship and purists will grumblingly inquire why jackson stopped short of such climactic scenes as gandalfs visit to isengard and frodo in shelobs lair enough quibbling these flaws fail to blunt the impact of the storys resonant moral insights tolkien made every characters heart a battlefield between desire and selflessness and jackson underlines and boldfaces this theme call it soul wars episode two villains give in to greed heroes persevere through christlike suffering gandalf returns from deaths edge a risen savior his healing of the poisoned king theoden which jackson gleefully exaggerates stands as one of the great movie exorcisms arwen surrenders her immortality in the name of love aragorn wrestles personal demons preparing to be a messianic king samwise patient and forgiving helps frodo carry his cross the fiercest struggle takes place in the tortured soul of gollum smeagol  gollums original hobbitlike self  struggles feebly to overcome his ravenous lustful alter ego like a timid child trying to slay a dragon it is the filmmakers most commendable triumph that he gains our sympathies we come to hope that by frodos stripes this poor creature can be healed in a season when critical favorites adaptation 8 mile gangs of new york tell fractured tales of heroes with broken moral compasses it is encouraging to watch tolkiens triumphs tragedies and consolations coalesce in the most compelling adventure film of 2002 if jackson shows the same focus in the return of the king to be released in 2003 it could be the most meaningful of them all our sister publication books  culture asked in its januaryfebruary 2002 issue if tolkien should be acknowledged as the foremost author of the twentieth century
Nov 1 2004,positive,the final acts battle scene is the most spectacular medieval type ever filmed pubished 1303
Aug 7 2004,positive,this second installment in the trilogy ends with gandalf intoning that the battle for middleearth is about to begin im pumped
Jan 6 2004,positive,with one film to go peter jackson is on the verge of completing a trifecta that will rank among the greatest achievements in film history
Dec 17 2003,positive,the most impressive new element in this installment is the completely cgicreated gollumhe turns in the best performance
Oct 7 2003,positive,equally as compelling as its predecessor and perhaps more technically awesome peter jacksons second middle earth chapter is as expected very very cool
Sep 7 2003,positive,it is simply what moviemaking should be the kind of film that proves that quality cinema and blockbuster entertainment are not and should not be mutually exclusive
Sep 3 2003,positive,yes its good but how good
Jun 19 2003,positive, is it too early to say the lord of the rings is the best cinematic fantasy trilogy of all time even with the series third installment the return of the king still a year a way based on this second chapter the two towers it most certainly is not i cannot imagine with all three films shot at once that the climax to this story will be any less of a stunning success than both this film and the fellowship of the ring proved to be part two literally hits the ground running there is no exposition no quick recap of last years oscarwinning epic and this sequel is all the better because of this even so the two towers is fabulously entertaining if only for its massive scope and suitably epic vision alone this gigantic undertaking is never anything less than stunning for practically every second of its almost threehour running time surpassing the considerably large expectations of an overeager audience at nearly every opportunity the fellowship has been fractured beyond repair the ringbearer frodo baggins elijah wood and his loyal friend sam gamgee sean astin are making their way into the treacherous lands of mordor alone meanwhile their hobbit companions merry dominic monaghan and pippin billy boyd are being held captive by a murderous band of urukhai making their way to the traitorous wizard saruman christopher lee but they will not be left to die human aragorn viggo mortensen elf legolas orlando bloom and dwarf gimli john rhysdavies are fast on the hordes trail and no matter what it takes they will save their two hobbit friends this chase comes to a sudden end with the arrival of an old friend thought dead in the caverns of moria fighting the vicious balrog the wizard gandalf ian mckellen is brought back to join the fight joining the three warriors he lets them know merry and pippin have been safely let out of danger and into the arms of the ancient tree creatures known as the ents instructing aragorn legolas and gimli to stop worrying about the two hobbits and that they must change direction and make for the kingdom of rohan immediately as for frodo and sam enter into a dangerous alliance with the devilish gollum andy serkis hoping to find some shred of his former self still intact the ringbearer spares the wicked creatures life in return for leading them into the heart of mordor at first frodos trust seems to pay dividends as the ravaged soul of the beast brutalized to virtual erasure under the influence of the one ring for so many decades begins to awake from its exceedingly long slumber the former hobbit making a valiant attempt to beat down the psychotic influences of gollum and let his former self known as sméagol regain control but the influence of the one ring is not so easily overcome and sam isnt so certain their new guide isnt just biding his time as he plots both his and frodos demise that is a lot of balls in the air to try and juggle successfully and with handfuls of new characters added to the mix director peter jackson and his team of craftsman unsurprisingly have their work cut out for them yet it is all handled splendidly introduction of the new characters is handled quickly and with eloquence what more even with the sequels breakneck pace each person is given room to develop into a fullyformed multidimensional human being the best of these new human faces are éowyn miranda otto and théoden king of rohan bernard hill otto is magnificent her gorgeous face glistening with determination and purpose even in the face of the gravest danger but shes no girlygirl and her growing infatuation with future king aragorn is quietly subtle hill is even better as for théoden hes broken shell of a man first introduced poisoned by the venomfilled words of his adviser gríma wormtongue a slithery brad dourif but with all his character loves and holds dear under threat of annihilation hill blossoms from lost soul to worried king to forceful leader throughout his story arc adding a level of haunted gravitas to the story thats superb the seductive influence of greed power and pure evil are everpresent most notably in the films most ingenious creation gollum here is the first completely cgi character that isnt just a technical showpiece and credit for that must fall as much on actor serkis shoulders as it should the productions technical crew it is a delicious performance overflowing in internalized conflict and irrational obsession all of it raging inside the body of a pitiful lost soul while i cant say these visual effects are seamless gollum is far from photorealistic that does not make them any less impressive this is a groundbreaking performance that will change the cinematic game forever the creatures movements and mannerisms birthed from the mind of the actor creating them and then dazzlingly augmented by jacksons crackerjack effects team at its center the two towers delivers one of the most spectacular battle sequences i have personally ever seen the battle of helms deep is like henry v at agincourt but with the odds multiplied by at least a factor of ten jackson unleashes a flurry of flying arrows swinging swords and huge explosions taking up a full hour of screen time this is a titanic struggle between good and evil where the outcome always feels even for those who have read tolkiens book somewhat in doubt its breathlessly incredible stuff the final showdown an eyepopping emotionfueled triumph that had me wanting to rise to my feet and cheer yet as magnificent as all of that might be jackson never loses sight of the bigger picture the director astutely hints at what is still to come knowing full well that the major dramatic twist and turns will culminate in force during the trilogys final chapter but he still allows for this film to stand entirely on its own even though it is the middle chapter of the story this is a landmark epic and a glorious entry into what is quickly becoming the most entertaining movie trilogy since the original star wars series i was left perfectly contented by the time things came to their expected cliffhanger of a conclusion and im beyond positive the lord of the rings the two towers is a motion picture ill happily watch multiple times in the future we are dedicated to creating a distinguished user experience and a website rich in content with solid execution our

Mar 7 2003,positive, youd better get reading  unless youre up to speed on the story so far part two of tolkiens trilogy could be a baffling experience you can see why the title of the two towers peter jacksons new tolkien film has caused a certain disquiet in the us by coincidentally evoking associations with the world trade centres twin towers nonetheless im glad he stuck with it as it happens in this installment of the trilogy allegorical echoes of september 11 and its aftermath can be heard all over middleearth  i realise that such a reading would have outraged tolkien who rejected all attempts to draw parallels between his mythical world and our own but the temptation is irresistible  especially right now as we rejoin the hobbits their faith in the power of good has been shaken to its foundations the great wizard gandalf ian mckellen is no more and in the black fortress of isengard his evil counterpart saruman christopher lee is gathering an army of mass destruction whats more theres no way of getting weapons inspectors in to be honest im not one of tolkiens fans this doesnt mean i fail to respect their clout its the reason jackson feels confident enough to plunge in here precisely where he left off at the end of part one there is no wimpy recapping of earlier events were shown frodo elijah wood reliving gandalfs defeat in a dream sequence and thats it for exposition  if youre not already on board you scrabble around as best you can and this means hard work which is something rare  and yes exhilarating  in a modern blockbuster while getting your bearings in middleearth you have to keep pace with rapidly multiplying subplots and newly introduced species  along with the orcs the elves the hobbits and the khazad are the ents the ringwraiths and the urukhai and if youre already confused preliminary research is advisable or not  the alternative is just to concentrate on gollum a creature of such unnerving weirdness that he alone is enough to make this episode an infinitely more involving proposition than the last created by laying a computergenerated image over the movements of an actor andy serkis wearing a bodyhugging speedskaters suit gollum is both ancient and childlike hideous and pitiful  when we catch up with him hes nearly 600 years old  a naked bateared goblinlike figure bleached to a skeletal whiteness by the centuries of travail and torture brought upon him by his obsession with the ring and the power it bestows  a minute spent in his bony spectral presence is a far creepier experience than any number of poundings by jacksons massed armies of the night  gollum is out to steal the ring for himself  or the bad part of him is his benign half knows it should help frodo destroy it and so save the world and as he does battle with himself over this eternal dilemma you feel as if you could be eavesdropping on the white house hawks as they beat back the odd dove in their midst during debates about foreign policy ranging further through middleearth and giving you a better sense of tolkiens philosophies  proecology and antitechnology to the point of making him a luddite  this film is a betterpaced effort than the first it also introduces a bunch of new characters among them an uncharacteristically sternfaced david wenham as the ruler of the human stronghold of gondor and miranda otto as a princess of rohan the kingdom under threat from sarumans armies ottos role is the films big disappointment advance word led to expectations of a fully functioning warrior princess instead shes allowed only a couple of ninjalike flourishes with her broadsword before being sent back to join the womenfolk which brings me to the main trouble with tolkien and his coldclimate mythology and it goes beyond the complaint that women are relegated to bit players his gods and demigods are so drearily chaste not for him the blithe omnisexuality of the hindu and mediterranean gods who regard power and eroticism as interchangeable hes not even into arthurian notions of licensed flirtation his preferred method of romance is by remote control  a case of abstinence making the heart grow fonder  you sense him nodding approvingly when hugo weavings elf king is moved to lecture his daughter arwen liv tyler on the miseries to come if she insists on pursuing her crossspecies love affair with the mortal hero aragorn viggo mortensen hell grow old and die and shell be forced to watch before wandering off to spend the rest of her days in weary solitude what still excites me most about the films are the behindthescenes adventures which went into their making jackson pledged his down under armies of craftsmen technicians and special effects people to his cause took it to the gates of hollywood and returned with the money to make these things even more to his credit the adventure continues
Feb 21 2003,positive,if the first film was a hearty appetizer the second film is a full course dinner i cant wait to see what jackson serves us for dessert

Feb 16 2003,positive,the greatest fantasy epic of alltime continues with a mesmerizing middle chapter that leaves great hopes for the thrilling conclusion
Feb 8 2003,positive,   the first thing i should say when reviewing lord of the rings  the two towers peter jacksons threehour followup  to his immensely powerful first installment of the lord of  the rings fantasy saga last decembers the  fellowship of the ring is that in doing so i must reveal  certain story aspects that could be considered spoilers the legions  of diehard fans of jrr tolkeins books know what happens  in the story but those who havent read the books may want  to avoid reading this review until after theyve seen the  film as there is at least one major surprise inherent in the  plot having said that the second point that pops to mind is  that it would be an enormous task for jackson to outdo last years  phenomenon since it was one of the most amazing allaround cinematic  experiences to come along in years and this is merely the second  of three installments and yet he pretty much does just that  this second episode filmed simultaneously with the first and  third lives up in every way to the epic grandeur of last years  movie layering tolkeins famous story adapted by fran walsh  philippa boyens stephen sinclair and director jackson with  the same sweeping cinematography enchantingly realized effects  and flawless acting as fellowship while adding the many  new characters creatures and locations included in the second  book there are a few choices that i was not particularly thrilled  with but ill get to that in a minute  in terms of story this is obviously a continuation of the  quest begun by hobbit frodo baggins elijah wood to destroy the  immensely powerful one ring created by the evil sorcerer sauron  by traveling back to saurons domain of mordor and casting  it into the fires of mt doom from whence it came but its  hard to do that when everybody you encounter good and bad wants  it for their very own while frodos hobbit friend sam gamgee  sean astin stuck with him at the end of the first movie the  remaining members of the fellowship were scattered gandalf the  grey ian mckellen the wise and friendly wizard fell into the  depths of moria while battling the immense firebeast balrog  but as we learn in an amazing action sequence at the very beginning  of towers he was not killed but having battled the monster  to the death was transformed into gandalf the white with much  more power to do good meanwhile the two other hobbits merry  dominic monaghan and pippin billy boyd were captured by the  army of orcs under the control of evil wizard saruman christopher  lee and the other 3 remaining members aragorn viggo mortensen  and his friends legolas the elf orlando bloom and gimli the  dwarf john rhysdavies began pursuing the orcs through the  land of rohan to save their friends  this has got to be the first movie where one of the most remarkable  performances was done by a computergenerated character the strange  and immensely creepy creature gollum aka sméagol who  was hardly seen in fellowship becomes one of the main  characters here crawling along with frodo and sam first attempting  to kill them for the ring but then becoming their guide through  the treacherous land of mordor dont get me wrongthis  is not a slam against the live actors who all do exquisite work  its a compliment to the technical staff who can create a  complex conflicted character seemingly out of thin air and of  the powerful work by andy serkis who not only voiced sméagol  but participated in his scenes wearing a motioncapture suit which  allowed the computer technicians who created the creature to follow  his every move gollum is so tortured so conflicted hes  capable of so many subtle facial and vocal expressions that as  he wrestles with his schizophrenic characterization we dont  know whether to revile or pity him this is an immensely important  point since one of the major plot elements is frodos struggle  with the same decision  new characters and new cinematic challenges are presented in  this story all realized with the same creative genius jackson  showed us last year the epic battle of helms deep only  possible after gandalf frees king théoden of rohan bernard  hill from the evil influence of sarumans minion wormtongue  brad dourif is as visually remarkable in some ways as speilbergs  battle footage in saving private  ryan théodens nephew éomer karl  urban and niece éowyn miranda otto are both introduced  as powerful allies to the fellowship as well as faramir david  wenham the brother of boromir who was killed at the end of  the first film the ents a treelike race of forest shepherds  led by treebeard another cgi creation with the voice of rhysdavies  are as remarkable from a sound standpoint as they are visually  with their deep voices uttering out the slow droning intonations  of their ancient language it takes us a long time to say  things rumbles treebeard but we only say things  that are worth saying then there are the titular towers  themselves sarumans orthanc standing starkly amid the  scorched earth of his orc factory at isengard and baraddur  located in the center of mordor where saurons huge disembodied  eye maintains a constant vigil for the ring finally there are  brief but important repeat performances by liv tyler as arwen  the elfprincess in love with aragorn hugo weaving as her father  elrond and cate blanchett as galadriel the allknowing elvish  priestess  the only things i can find wrong with this movie and they  are minor points are some slight alterations of the plot which  will annoy the devoted middleearth freaks more than they did  me like aragorns brief disappearance in the middle of the  film that it never occurs in the original text is less annoying  than the fact that it feels like a cheap repetition of what happened  to gandalf in the first film i also dont like that gimli  becomes an almost comic character constantly pratfalling and  enduring jacksons cinematic short jokes one of which is  truly ridiculous his character in the books is just as noble  and respected as all the others here he almost becomes a stooge

Jan 25 2003,positive,a brilliantly conceived adventure that has the capacity to take your breath away
Jan 19 2003,positive,for attaining a sense of sheer unadulterated awe its difficult to imagine many films that could satisfy cinemagoers quite as resoundingly as peter jacksons mammoth adaptation of jrr tolkiens trilogy
Jan 19 2003,negative,a film that worships itself with every frame a sprawling boisterous fantasy but one that takes itself as seriously as if it were a documentary

Jan 15 2003,positive,to begin chronicling jacksons achievements in leaving you gasping would take longer than the running time of the finished film
Jan 14 2003,positive, gird your loins buckle your armor take a deep breath and plunge yourself into the dark fierce epic that is part two of the lord of the rings that peter jackson and his remarkable team have done it again is no surprise most of it was shot at the same time as the first so it wasnt apt to fall apart still whats remarkable is how immediately after a full year the two towers seizes your attention and how urgently it holds you through three seamless actionpacked hours the fellowship had split apart when last we saw them and the new film follows three separate trails frodo elijah wood and sam sean astin heading for mordor to destroy the ring are joined in their quest by an emaciated suspiciously servile creature named gollum who offers to serve as their guide elsewhere in middle earth aragorn viggo mortensen gimli the dwarf john rhysdavies and legolas the elf orlando bloom come to the aid of king theoden of rohan bernard hill who must defend his kingdom against sarumans terrifying army of orcs and urukhai in the forest of fangorn the two hobbits merry dominic monaghan and pippin billy boyd are rescued from their captors by an ent named treebeard an ancient walking and talking tree who must be persuaded to join arms with the humans the hobbits and the elves to defend middle earth from the evil sauron at stake is everything the two towers takes more liberties with tolkien than the fellowship of the ring did its also more violent and nightmarish but jackson a master of scale and perspective doesnt let it become claustrophobic few people can stage a battleand the eyepopping siege of helms deep is one of the most spectacular youll ever seewith such sweep and clarity that the carnage doesnt seem an oppressive end in itself the tale never loses touch with its human core amid all the surreal visions terrifying monsters and overwhelming landscapes its the naked skinny schizophrenic gollum who snakes his way most deeply into your memory created digitally with a motioncapture technique that mimicked the movements of actor andy serkis who also supplied his hissing voice gollum is a previously hobbitlike creature grotesquely deformed by having once possessed the ring while everyone else in tolkiens myth falls neatly into the camps of good and evil the selflacerating gollum is at war with himself in an epic drenched in medievalism hes the dangerously ambiguous voice of the modern martin scorseses lavish wildly ambitious epic of 1860s new york takes the audience down some of the meaner streets in american history its set in five points a crimeridden slum where recently arrived immigrants are pitted against brutally xenophobic nativists and anarchy is held at bay just barely by the tribal dictates of competing gangs with names like the plug uglies the daybreak boys and the dead rabbits the scariest and most powerful of the local warlords is william cutting aka bill the butcher daniel daylewis a oneeyed nativist who would just as soon carve up an irishman as a slice of pork gangs of new york culminates in the violent draft riots of 1863 and as a dark diligently researched history lesson it fascinates and enlightens the problem is with the drama in the foreground this tale of revenge in which young amsterdam vallon leonardo dicaprio comes to the five points to kill the butcherthe man who murdered his fathertakes a mighty long time to engage your emotions it doesnt fully catch fire until the hamletlike midsection when amsterdam having been treated as a surrogate son by the unwitting bill first tries and fails to kill him bills a vibrant villain and a stunningly theatrical daylewis plays him to the hilt but our hero remains onedimensional and the usually spontaneous dicaprio seems constrained by the part it doesnt help that his romance with cameron diazs pickpocket prostitute falls back on firsttheykissthentheyfight cliches scorsese seems most engaged in the violent set pieces which have a brutal terrifying poetry but a cloak of artifice hangs over the movie gangs is a dream project scorsese has wanted to make for 30 years you have to honor its mad ambition but sadly it feels like a dream too long deferred the teenage runaway frank abagnale jr leonardo dicaprio was a child prodigy of crime by the time he was arrested at 21 he had cashed millions of dollars in forged checks and had successfully impersonated an airline pilot a doctor a lawyer and a university teacher with a combination of charm charisma and chutzpah his true story cleverly adapted by jeff nathanson is the basis for former child prodigy steven spielbergs zippy catch me if you can a delicious catandmouse game flecked with intriguing oedipal undertones as the mercurial mouse dicaprio sparkles far more comfortable in the everchanging skin of this slick chameleon than he is in scorseses epic the dogged cat is fbi agent carl hanratty a droll buttoneddown tom hanks always one methodical step behind his prey as hanrattys pursuit drags on from year to year his resolve never wavers but his enmity evolves into an almost paternal concern for his young foe meanwhile franks real dad frank sr christopher walken looms behind his sons every larcenous deed hes a charming fasttalking failure whose slippery relationship with the truth and firm belief in the importance of appearances provide the template for his sons life of deception walkens performance is hilarious poignant and full of surprises its nice to see spielberg in a larky relatively modest spirit catch me is never less than engaging all thats missing is a proper crescendo the picture moves along briskly even at two and a half hours but it seems to be running on cruise control spielberg has caught the sunny primarycolor spirit of the prewar 60s the american optimism that frank jr both exemplifies and parodies frank lives life as if he were an actor in a movie his costumes determining his identity his fate dependent on improv with all the mundane boring parts school job training edited out like spielberg hes a firm believer in cutting to the chase renee zellweger and catherine zetajones put on quite a show in rob marshalls dazzling cinematic rethinking of the 1975 kander and ebb musical directed by bob fosse the setting is prohibitionera chicago and our antiheroines are two bitter rivals aspiring singer roxie hart zellweger and vaudeville star velma kelly zetajones both jailed for killing their men theres nothing like notoriety to jumpstart a career roxie reasons she hires legendary lawyer billy flynn a tapdancing richard gere to plead her case and parlays murder into celebrity when i saw the 1995 broadway revival late in its run the shows cynical bite needed dentures now directorchoreographer marshall screenwriter bill condon and a cast that includes queen latifah and john c reilly who knew he could sing and dance have restored its teeth the musical numbers are now presented as figments of roxies spotlightlusting imagination and the movie flows back and forthstylishly fluidlybetween reality and illusion on the surface zellweger isnt the tough cookie we associate with the role a gumchewing ginger rogers played her in the 1942 roxie hart but her veneer of vulnerability makes her venom effective who knew she could sing and dance chicago is exuberantly theatrical yet every inch a movie and some numbers the cell block tango are so entertaining you might want to applaud first moulin rouge now this could the movie musical be making a comeback roman polanski escaped from the cracow ghetto when he was 7 years old until now he has avoided making a film about the holocaust though you could feel its shadow behind every movie he has made the pianist the first feature hes made in poland since his 1962 knife in the water isnt autobiographical its based on the memoirs of wladyslaw szpilman an acclaimed concert pianist who miraculously survived the nazi occupation of warsaw but you can feel it was made by a man whos been there its in the little details in its refusal of sentimentality in its cleareyed assessment of the depths people will descend tojews poles and germans alikeas well as the heights to which they rise the objective tonea detachment that contains pools of rage and sorrowis set by szpilman himself who never raises his voice in his memoirs nor does adrien brody who plays him here with soulful elegance at first szpilman is an urbane slightly aloof onlooker of the approaching nightmare then when he and his family are herded into the warsaw ghetto the man who has everything becomes a man who has nothing saved from deportation to the camps by a jewish turncoat guardthe rest of his family are not so luckyhe eventually escapes from the ghetto only to become a hunted man alone sickly hiding for his life english playwright ronald harwoods screenplay sticks close to szpilmans book showing us everything through the protagonists eyes the warsaw ghetto uprising is seen only as its glimpsed through the window of szpilmans hideout just outside the ghetto walls for long stretches of his confinement hes more a witness than a participant in the drama we see through him the spectacle of a great city reduced to physical and moral rubble polanski shows us shocking visionsnazi soldiers hurling an invalid off a balcony a starving man licking spilled soup off the dirty ghetto pavementbut he never hypes up the horror for effect the pianist is all the more harrowing and moving for this restraint this powerful precisionmade movie offers hope as wellan act of kindness from a german officer that saves the pianists life the music that sustains his soul in going home to tell szpilmans story polanski seems reborn once again hes become a filmmaker who matters
Jan 13 2003,positive,a thrilling work of film craft
Jan 10 2003,positive,lets pray that we still have another ahead of us and that the rocky uneven qualities of the current film will ultimately be revealed as merely a tortuous pathway on the route toward resurgent triumph
Jan 9 2003,positive, if you didnt  see 2001s the fellowship of the ring  the first chapter in peter jacksons threepart film version of jrr tolkiens the lord of the rings  get the dvd jackson leaps into part ii with no patience for laggers the two towers shot at the same time as part i and part iii is spectacular in every sense of the word even if you don t know an orc from a urukhai heres the tease the fellowship has scattered frodo the hobbit elijah wood still holds the allpowerful ring that he and sam sean astin must drop into mount doom merry dominic monaghan and pippin billy boyd are adrift in a forest talking to an ent a tree that talks back the human warrior aragorn viggo mortensen growing steadily impressive in the role is still fighting the evil saruman christopher lee with the help of elf archer legolas orlando bloom and gimli the dwarf john rhysdavies its aragorn who must release the rohan king a noble moving bernard hill from sarumans spell and help save middleearth in a climactic clash at helms deep the parallels to the warring forces of democracy and fundamentalism are inescapable that ranks with the greatest battles in film history the two towers suffers a bit from being the middle chapter no beginning no end but jackson keeps the action percolating the effects astonish none more so than gollum a computergenerated creature hauntingly voiced by andy serkis gollum looks like a wasted junkie and speaks with a rasp to rival linda blairs in the exorcist of the ring that corrupted him as my precious the battle between good and evil in this character catches the soul of the movie the return of the king the final chapter will be released a year from now i cant wait
Jan 8 2003,positive,after experiencing the two towers youll realize that the fellowship was merely a nice appetizer to the extravagant main course now we cant wait for dessert
Jan 8 2003,positive,the years greatest adventure and jacksons limited but enthusiastic adaptation has made literature literal without killing its soul  a feat any thinking person is bound to appreciate
Jan 8 2003,positive, these characters are feeling as people not just enduring as tragedy finds them this is the very thing that sets the lord of the rings apart from nearly all modern fantasy films since excalibur two towers down one king to go
Jan 6 2003,positive,just as jacksons film of the fellowship of the ring shared the almost leisurely pace of the first book the two towers captures the relentless momentum of the next
Jan 6 2003,positive,i enjoyed it even more than the first movie
Jan 6 2003,positive,it works and works superbly
Jan 5 2003,positive,jackson  is at his best when coordinating enormous numbers of people and impressive special effects into a cohesive and stunning whole
Jan 4 2003,positive,the storylines are woven together skilfully the magnificent swooping aerial shots are breathtaking and the overall experience is awesome
Jan 3 2003,positive, january 2 2003  the lord of the rings the two towers is best viewed not as a single film but as onethird of an epic film the first part of this epic was lord of the rings the fellowship of the rings released a year ago and the last third of this epic will be lord of the rings the return of the king to be released next christmas the three films can rightly be regarded as one for two reasons one they are based on three books which form both a trilogy and a single story two because all three films were shot at the same time over a threeyear period by the same director cast and crew in a sense this is a bigscreen miniseries  it is no surprise then that two towers picks up right were the last film in the series left off there is no introduction of characters and little character development in this film because all that was done in the first film the story is split into four parallel stories the first is the continuing adventures of the two hobbits frodo and samwise who are trying to destroy the one ring so that sauron cant get his hands on it and use it to destroy the world the second is the continuing adventures of aragorn gimli and legolas as they make a last stand to stop the huge urukhai army of sauruman an ally of sauron at the fortress of helms deep the third is the continuing adventures of the remainder of the fellowship of the ring two hobbits known as peregrin pippin took and meriadoc merry brandybuck the film constantly shifts among these three main subplots and one other subplot which isnt in the book a developing romantic triangle between aragorn arwen undómiel and éowyn princess of rohan  there is so much cutting back and forth that nothing much seems to happen in the film until the battle at helms deep that is the battle is spectacular in its scope and fury even though it uses a timehonored western cliché this is an epic screen battle despite that this film like the book serves to continue to the story and like a bridge deliver us to that last film which should be even more spectacular viewed as a separate entity this film is not quite as successful as the first because the narrative is split four ways and there is less character development this film rates a b when viewed separately but rates an a when viewed as a part of a magnificent whole  a couple of major new characters are developed in the film and both are nonhuman gollum introduced in the first film at a distance becomes a fullfledged character in the two towers after being captured by samwise and frodo although his appearance on the screen is a computer construct much of gollums considerable personality is due to the acting skills of andy serkis of 24 hour party people serkis doesnt just do the voice of gollum he also provides much of the motion for the character in the film serkis performed all the gollum scenes in the movie wearing special motioncapture devices which enabled filmmakers to substitute gollums image for serkis after filming the other new character is treebeard voice by john rhysdavies the ent a computergenerated construct created by weta digital of new zealand which did many of the computergenerated effects in the film another new character is gríma wormtongue a really nasty advisor to king théodon bernard hill the character of wormtongue is brought to life perfectly by veteran character actor brad dourif of alien resurrection other new characters include éowyn miranda otto of what lies beneath éomér rohan warrior and nephew to king théodon played by karl urban  returning characters include frodo baggins elijah wood gandalf ian mckellen aragorn viggo mortensen samwise gamgee sean astin pippin billy boyd legolas greenleaf orlando bloom of black hawk down gimli john rhysdavies merry dominic monaghan arwen liv tyler and sauruman christopher lee the acting is solid throughout the other returning star of this film is the stunning mountain scenery of new zealand where this was filmed huge impressive sets built in remote areas of new zealand give us an authenticlooking castle of rohan and the fortress of helms deep although there isnt much character development in the film aside from gollum the relationships between frodo and samwise and between pippin and merry are sketched in a bit more despite the fact that this film is nearly 3 hours long it seems rushed because of the need to cut back and forth among the various story lines look for more of the story to be filled in and look for more character development in the next dvd in the series the first special edition dvd for the last film provided additional footage that smoothed out the narrative flow of the first film i anticipate the same for the two towers dvd due out towards the end of this year again kudos to director peter jackson and the rest of the crew for filming a story long thought to be unfilmable it is an incredibly difficult project but the filmmakers are not just succeeding in their task they are making a truly exceptional film series in the process  click here for links to places to buy this movie in video andor dvd format the soundtrack books even used videos games and lots of other stuff i suggest

Jan 2 2003,positive,tolkien groupies be damned but i cant ever remember the books ever being this action filled
Dec 31 2002,positive,a powerful sequel and one of the best films of the year
Dec 29 2002,positive, the immediate question of course is whether the two towers lives up to the fellowship of the ring and the answer is  not quite but thats not a complete answer since the two towers is in many respects a very different film than its predecessor in the lord of the rings trilogy its much more of a grand epic so its somewhat less thoughtful than the first film by its very nature as a result it lacks a good bit of fellowships emotional intensity there is nothing in the two towers for instance that carries the same emotional resonance as the first films final scene of frodo elijah wood and sam sean astin in the boat nor is there anything to conclude this new entry that bears the same kind of punch as the the two towers closing shot those reservations aside the second film is a remarkable achievement  and a groundbreaking one the two towers follows frodo and sams further attempts to return the ring of power to the fires from whence it came while the film separately details the adventures of aragorn viggo mortensen legolas orlando bloom and gimli john rhysdavies and also deals with the resurrection of gandalf ian mckellen and the fates of hobbits pippin billy boyd and merry dominc monaghan its a huge canvas  and there is more to it than even this list of principal characters indicates  but peter jackson details it all so lovingly and so carefully that the movie never confuses moreover the timing of individual sequences  the nature of the narrative requiring much crosscutting between characters  is beyond reproach at no time do you ever get the sense that youve stayed away from one story line for too long jackson and his cowriters have scored a major triumph in this regard and in so many others as well there is simply no way a review can begin to discuss or even catalogue the immense riches of the two towers so ill settle on discussing a few of its finer points first of all its a movie that is both very much of its time and one that is steeped in the history of film for example scene after scene in the court of theoden bernard hill  especially those featuring grima wormtongue brad dourif  look for all the world as if they came straight out of sergei eisensteins ivan the terrible for that matter wormtongue might well have been visually modeled on eisensteins ivan also check out the films amazing battle scenes  possibly the most stunning and beautifully logical of their kind ever committed to film  and youll see filmmaking obviously grounded in the combat scenes from orson welles chimes at midnight yet the two towers is ultimately very modern a work of this scale could only have been possible through technological advances in the cgi realm  the film in fact offers the most convincing work of its kind to date forget the computergenerated yoda in lucas attack of the clones and all previous efforts to meld cgi characters with real actors the two towers delivers the goods the movies cgicreated character gollum is wholly believable as a real entity interacting with the live actors indeed andy serkis who provides the voice of the hyperparanoid gollum and who also served as the model for the characters movements is so convincing and so powerful in the role that serkis  who doesnt actually appear in the film  is being suggested for best supporting actor consideration possibly even more remarkable is the films depiction of the enigmatic tree creatures the ents the image of ambulatory trees  no matter how well done  could easily have toppled over into the risible but jackson and his cowriters have deftly sidestepped this possibility by taking a tip from lord of the rings author jrr tolkien and making the creatures amusing from the onset by having it take nigh on forever for the ents to conclude that pippin and merry arent the enemy orcs and by reworking tolkiens dialogue concerning the length of time it takes the ents to say anything in their own language we do not say anything  unless it is worth taking a long time to say and to listen to  the film invites us to deliberately laugh with it so that we dont laugh at it its a brilliant stroke and it pays off handsomely but its just one of many brilliant strokes by a filmmaker who isnt afraid to run the risk of looking foolish  and as a result almost never does instead jackson reaches out and touches on true greatness the two towers is after all a huge movie and everything about it ought to be huge what is perhaps most remarkable is the films position as the developmental center of the lord of the rings saga jackson is telling as such it lacks both a proper beginning and ending in itself and yet it never feels incomplete the movie is whole unto itself even though its lacks the first films sense of concluding on an emotional high point go see the two towers for yourself  and then see it again let it amaze you with its wonders its size and its rich complexity there is so much to admire in this film that you could see it a
