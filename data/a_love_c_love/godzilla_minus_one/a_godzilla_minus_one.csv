Apr 12 2024,positive,this movie is great from start to finish
Apr 12 2024,positive,i think this godzilla movie is fantastic but one of the worst theater experience ever from amc but the rest of the movie was amazing and terrifying and sad but i am excited for the dvd and bluray
Apr 12 2024,positive,this was the best movie ever  one of the first times when human action was awesome  such an emotional and awe inspiring journey  loved it would recommend  1010
Apr 12 2024,positive,this is how a godzilla movie should be driven by by japanesestyle human drama instead of mindless hollywood destruction and special effects the best godzilla movie ever
Apr 12 2024,positive,why is it so good everything down to the soundtrack characters and story are absolutely flawless even the 10 million dollar budget cgi although flawed was amazing i cant believe i cried for the half of the movies runtime i also hate and love godzilla so much
Apr 11 2024,positive,this is what hollywood should aim for this was a beautiful movie with a very well written cast of characters and godzilla maintained his charm without loosing it from the human characters and was used quite well  im glad that this movie has been extremely successful and that toho continues to make more well written and thought out stories with godzilla
Apr 11 2024,positive,it was great its waaaay better than the garbage hollywood has been churning out hollywood is only producing leftist trash i loved how godzilla minus one showed that people dont need to rely on government it also focuses on family its an absolute must watch
Apr 10 2024,positive,setting aside my love of godzilla this may have been the best movie of the year as an oifoef vet much of what he went though and several different themes rang true even without big g this was just a great drama i hope they dont make another one how could it be better than minus one
Apr 7 2024,negative,this movie was trash human characters are stupid plot is same as others movies that have the same plot vfx effects are actually good and godzilla was only good part is a waste of time 110
Apr 7 2024,positive,amazing film definitely top 3 in the godzilla universe
Apr 7 2024,positive,low key masterpiece
Apr 6 2024,positive,man oh man what a ride this one was i chanced the trip to tucson in my van that is edging ever closer to 300000 miles and that is about the payoff i got     the plot is masterful the creature spfx are enormous and rightly deserved the oscar it won and the best part there are no oxygen destroyers no fantasy fictitious scientific weapons nothing but real life applications such as ship cabling and explosive laden aircraft to employ in their frantic effort to take the monster down and the cliffhanger of the dorsal fin shaped radiation burn spreading across the female protagonists neck was the best part  i sincerely hope that there will either be a direct sequel or that yamazaki is tapped to do another kaiju film i know i will be watching
Apr 5 2024,positive,i wanted to wait a bit to make sure it wasnt recency bias but im confident in calling godzilla minus one the best godzilla movie in the franchises 35 catalog with a gripping story of confronting and dealing with grief and guilt the film utilizes godzilla as a perfect representation of the internal and external chaos we encounter in life only by learning to value and cherish his own life does kōichi find true purpose in living every human character is incredible in their writing and acting godzilla is a terrifying presence that capitalizes on every element that makes him a great antagonist the low budget is often brought up as part of the mindblowing realization that this movie fits right in with hollywoods best effects and for good reason with oscarwinning visuals godzilla minus one is able to deliver one of the best stories of 2023 with a beautiful canvas in its presentation always thrilled to see the kaiju genre be used so masterfully
Apr 4 2024,positive,the best movie of 2023 is all i can see when i watched the movie it was perfect every single bit of the movie the atomic breath scene with the dorsal fins look very clean i thought for a second when i watched the trailer that the city behind godzilla really was destroyed turns out i was wrong it was just the best cgi i have ever seen this movie shouldnt just deserve only 1 oscar for just best action movie it deserves best movie of the year
Apr 4 2024,positive,this is an absolute masterpiece highly recommend
Apr 3 2024,negative,this is a boring and and quite lacking film this doesnt even come close to godzilla x king kong
Apr 3 2024,positive,this movie is perfection i have no complaints its absolutely amazing godzilla having meaning again and being a metaphor for the horrors of humanities creation is tragically beautiful definitely the best human plot ive seen in any film of the daikaiju genre
Apr 2 2024,positive,a little too talky but the monster stuff is way good
Apr 1 2024,positive,this is the first and only godzilla movie that made me care about humans in movie all other godzilla movies america and japan i never like boring except for one and two nothing more godzilla actually looks terrifying to me any other godzilla movies he never look scary to me this is better than shin godzilla human parts are not as boring compared to shin godzilla and more likable and godzilla fights as should not like transformer in shin godzilla shooting lasers from tail and back fins
Apr 1 2024,positive,this movie was perfectly executed from the storyline and acting to the visual effects and cinematography my expectations were far exceeded i found zero faults with this film
Apr 1 2024,positive,the greatest solo kaiju feature of all time a beautiful story mixed with beautiful effects and amazing acting from everyone involved  i had to wipe my tears away in time for the next scenes constantly
Apr 1 2024,positive,i never expected even to watch another godzilla movie but luckily i read some rave reviews and went this is one of the strongest recent movies from any country and it may be the greatest giant monster movie ever made in part because of the stellar special effects cinematography editing etc but mainly because you care deeply about the human charactersall of them including the nameless city dwellers who have to face destruction theres a strong sense of tragedy that is right up front and really makes you love the characters even the ones who seem at first to have been crushed by the war they recover in moving ways theres a moment early on when an embittered neighbor lady who has lost everyone in her family suddenly makes a decision to help an orphaned baby and the young mother who has taken her in it sounds cheesy but the actors make it work really well at that point i realized this might be something special and it keeps getting better and more gripping from there theres another moment where a major character gets swept away as if she were nothing that made me sob loudly  in a theater for the first time in years great psychological depth throughout and politically interesting in that its disillusioned heroes are striving toward a different form of heroism than the fascist wartime version of heroism as selfdestruction  if you want to see a convincing movie about the power of hope watch this plus its got the best little crying girl in movie history
Mar 31 2024,positive,i cant add anything more than what has been said except that the hype is real  this is an exceptional film that just happens to be a kaiju movie
Mar 31 2024,positive,simply moving and brilliant on a human scale and the brutal terrifying force that is godzilla takes the whole movie to 11 best godzilla movie next to the original 1954 film
Mar 31 2024,positive,easily the best and scariest godzilla movie so far the time spent with the human drama could stand to be a little shorter but still a great movie
Mar 31 2024,positive,expected to enjoy the movie but surprisingly loved it top 5 movies i ever seen cant wait to see it again
Mar 31 2024,positive,this is the one i wanted to meet after all the longawaited godzillas overwhelming presence is the best

Mar 30 2024,negative,ehhhhh  its whatever  i fell asleep
Mar 30 2024,positive,this film is beyond your average monster movie it has a thrilling story deep and fleshed out human characters and gorgeous visual effects  godzilla in this film although smaller than his monsterverse counterpart is pure terror and an unstoppable force of nature deserved oscar winner the atomic breath scene gives me chills every time
Mar 30 2024,positive,truly amazing to see the human side done so well
Mar 30 2024,positive,truly an amazing and beautiful piece to have the pleasure of viewing cant wait for the digital release
Mar 29 2024,positive,one of the best movies i have ever seen didnt really know what to expect as it was the first japanese style godzilla film i had seen in a very long time and it blew me away enjoyed it alot
Mar 29 2024,positive,the amount of emotions you go through in this movie is crazy for a monster movie  but it isnt just that it has heart character and the humans in this you actually care for  i never expected to be emotional over a kaiju movie  a well deserved oscar too
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie is a cinema masterpiecewith a small budget and a lot of heartthis movie blows away every other godzilla movie made by milescentering around an actual story about the ppl was a long needed approachwe learn to care for these ppl in their fight with godzillafresh off ww2i really cant say enough good things about this moviesimply a masterpiece
Mar 29 2024,positive,if you like godzilla this is a must see  i was blown away by how much i enjoyed godzilla minus one  my favorite to date for sure
Mar 28 2024,positive,godzilla minus one is unequivocally and truly a cinematic triumph  with a 15 million dollar budget we received a film with emotional depth meandering characterization beautiful visuals and a masterpiece addressing significant themes of survivors guilt ptsd shame and the human condition      i am blown away simply by how this can be one of the best action films of the year perhaps the best godzilla film ever put to screen yet have me invested emotionally in so many of the characters in typical fashion this is not normally the case    after reading and hearing all the hype for this film i did want it to be in my top 10 of 2023 but i dont think by no fault of the filmmakers that this is necessarily a movie that resonates with me  and full transparency perhaps my viewing experience and personal feelings towards the film may have been elevated if id watched it in a theatre with an audience     nevertheless this is hopefully a wake up call for hollywood great films can be made with amazing visuals and an encompassing narrative without the 200 million dollar price tag attached
Mar 28 2024,positive,it was amazingyou actually feel for the characters and godzilla is portrayed as a actual character
Mar 28 2024,positive,simply fantastic a perfect showcase of the franchises original roots

Mar 21 2024,positive,this movie is awesome
Mar 20 2024,positive,simply the perfect godzilla film    this movie is everything you want in a godzilla film a terrifying godzilla an amazing soundtrack and easily the best human story in the entire franchise    this movie uses vfx but in a way that still feels like suitmation and the tiny budget makes it even more impressive
Mar 20 2024,positive,one of the best films of 2023 possibly the best godzilla film ever made one of the best theater experiences of my life perfect balance of the humans and godzilla himself
Mar 19 2024,positive,its amazing for my firsts godzilla movie seen in theaters this movie is a masterpiece the first godzilla movie to get an oscar its well deserved
Mar 18 2024,positive,it was really good but shin godzilla still better and the wife of the main character who survive is a lot weird i know shes probably wife godzilla power or something like that but its still not relevant sadly
Mar 18 2024,positive,i never thought i would walk away from 2023 with godzilla minus one in the top 3 best movies of the year but here we are and im still mad that it wasnt nominated for best picture  then again the awards never made sense anyway nor have they ever mattered in decades    one of the many things that has been missing from the godzilla films especially the ones made in the usa are likable characters we want to see survive  and this movie delivers that missing ingredient along with great directing writing and acting  despite the film being in japanese i was able to understand and become invested in the lives of these characters in a postwwii setting of japan  the main character has an arc that is in connection to godzilla and its done very well    speaking of which godzilla himself makes a return to his roots as just being a monster of destruction a true animal of nature on a bigger scale  in what appears to be a mixing of previous films interpretation on the king of monsters origins godzilla is an ancient creature that mutates due to the radiation of the nuclear bombs dropped in japan  so its a mix of mother nature and manmade  and the best part is that they made godzilla scary again  which in turn makes you want to see the characters survive and win against the giant monster that is tearing apart their new lives that have been built from the ashes of a world war    theres only a few flaws to speak of  some of the cgi isnt that good although when it is good its really good  theres a few edit choices that felt weird and some moments of dialogue that didnt feel right but theyre very few and far between  aside from that its a very solid film    in all honesty this just might be the best godzilla film ever made  it has emotional weight a terrifying godzilla interesting and likable characters and just an enjoyable experience
Mar 17 2024,positive,absolutely phenomenal
Mar 17 2024,positive,gmo was a fun story the story is quite surprising because it follows very closely a man and his family after ww2 very touching story that will get you some tears at times dont worry godzilla is there you are also showed the state of japan after the war the acting is really good of course you can almost feel the acting coach with the very young girl but thats ok the special effect are fine to amazing the way they show how heavy godzilla is is interesting and there is no magical i can stand on the water with this one i give it 85 this is by far the best godzilla movie i have seen
Mar 17 2024,positive,lived up to the hype id been hearing about i have loved godzilla since i was a kid watching the movies on local tv on sunday mornings growing up i like the more recent monsterverse films but it was awesome to see godzilla as he originally was the bad guy also the human element delivered better than most hollywood films
Mar 16 2024,positive,this is easily one of the greatest godzilla movie of all time and im saying this as a godzilla fan and a critic the effects the plot the emotions and the characters are all amazing and this film made me actually be afraid of godzilla and it even made me root for the characters to win im also glad at one at the oscars for best vfxs
Mar 16 2024,positive,incredible i did not even want to go to the bathroom
Mar 14 2024,positive,man what can i say never thought id be able to bring my any of my somewhat picky siblings to watch a godzilla movie but this one was so good i had to make them see it they actually loved it and one of them cried
Mar 14 2024,positive,great moviebreathtaking visuals that will have you questioning the budgets of some other hollywood blockbuster godzilla is back to his horrifying glory of the 1950s in this film where he terrorize the country of japan after the end of the war in the film you will grow and care for the characters while staying stunned by the world thats built in it 9510

Mar 12 2024,positive,incredible i have to be real i dont like godzilla movies i think its the same story all the time so when i heard there is this movie titled godzilla minus one i was not hyped for it but my god i never knew i could enjoy a godzilla movie so much    very well done the acting the visuals fantastic

Mar 4 2024,positive,i see as many new movies as i can and this was the best in the last 12 months at least and i just saw dune 2 which was great the soundtrack made the movie great visual effects on top of that hands down the best best godzilla since the original
Mar 4 2024,positive,an excellent monster movie that features human drama just as compelling
Mar 3 2024,positive,a monster of a film this was one of my favorites of all timeit may even make the top 10 list the story was fantastic and unexpected i laughed cried and cheered for the protagonist the entire way who knew that a giant monster could win my heart love
Mar 3 2024,positive,the best godzilla movie ever created on par with the original
Mar 3 2024,positive,absolutely fantastic the story is meaningful and impactful redefines what a modern day godzilla movie can be
Mar 3 2024,positive,if you dont like this movie you are a sissy ducker that sucks dicks simple as that

Mar 1 2024,positive,absolutely amazing movie loved the visuals and the storyline
Mar 1 2024,positive,first monster movie to make me cry
Feb 28 2024,positive,no doubt the best godzilla movie of all time
Feb 28 2024,positive,its godzilla folks what more can i say
Feb 27 2024,positive,with real careable characters compelling story and the horrorific godzilla this becomes a perfect movie
Feb 27 2024,positive,amazing they could do so much with such a relatively small budget the movie hits hard and doesnt rely solely on over the top action scenes to entertain and keep the audience engaged the human story is powerful the acting top notch and the writing well this is the best written godzilla movie of all time
Feb 25 2024,positive,this movie was great i cant wait for another godzilla to come out 
Feb 25 2024,positive,this is so much better than the monsterverse movies   watching this movie made me feel like i was 5 again watching the 70s80s godzilla movies
Feb 25 2024,positive,the story of the human characters was beautiful and the best feature here not the giant lizard it could have been better and far more realistic although i appreciate thats not what this was aiming for with an environmental threat that didnt involve a cgi headache hogging so many scenes
Feb 24 2024,positive,the best movie of 2023 endlessly rewatchable every character has a strong arc and action scenes are edge of your seat poignant and super smart
Feb 24 2024,positive,this movie is unbelievably good  i was expecting more of a action type of godzilla but in japanese  but the story itself was completely s tier writing the best movie of 2023
Feb 24 2024,positive,the perfect example of how to make an ideal film
Feb 22 2024,positive,godzilla minus one is possibly the best entry for the character the visual effects are absolutely astounding and the human characters are actually compelling this feels like a modern take on the classic gojira film from the 1950s but for a new generation of fans to enjoy
Feb 22 2024,positive,i think ive seen all the godzilla movies and this is my favorite by far one of the best five movies of 2023 try to see it on the big screen also saw minus zero which i  and my 12yearold son  loved as much if not more
Feb 21 2024,positive,fist things first  this movie would be best pic material if godzilla was not in the film the human story is that good    this movie is special and different its a human story with godzilla in the backround and it works great we see just enough pof him that we are satisfied but the human drama is excellent morbid realistic and very well written    this movie to americans may come off as terryifying in some scenes americans may find the japanese dialect  as very nerve wrecking  simply put a great analogy    minus to the godzilla films is joker to the dc films    its just different and way way better if you ask me the mosterverse in usa looks laughably bad compared to this film  mark my words    this flick will break streaming records in america for a international release when it comes out
Feb 20 2024,positive,possibly movie of the year and clearly the best godzilla film some of the acting was a bit over the top for me but in general an awesome movie with some meaningful themes where i actually care for human characters in a godzilla movie which in itself is a great achievement 
Feb 20 2024,positive,pretty good all in all
Feb 19 2024,positive,literally so good that you could take godzilla out of the movie and itd still be fantastic
Feb 19 2024,positive,never did i think in a million years that a godzilla movie would make me sob in the theater like a child after it finished and make me have a ten minute long train of thought about life death selfsacrifice war and the value of life good god this movie is good i genuinely think this is one of the best movies ever made and definitely the best godzilla movie please go see it if you get a chance you will not be disappointed
Feb 17 2024,positive,the best godzilla film and i think it is far more better than the american version of godzilla every godzilla fan and non godzilla fan should watch this filmnote you dont need watch any other films to watch this film because its a complete reboot thanks for reading my review 
Feb 16 2024,positive,i am a huge godzilla fan  this was the best godzilla movie that has been made so far  normally when i am watching these movies i dont feel like the plot line is very strong  so i really enjoy the monster fighting although it seems as though while the monsters are fighting we are cutting away to the human characters talking about   some inane thing  this story was engaging enough that you didnt really miss that godzilla wasnt in the movie constantly
Feb 16 2024,positive,leave it to japan to totally outdo hollywood at their very own game with a fraction of the budget one would normally get for something of this magnitude and scale simply put the best godzilla movie to date awesome visuals and a thoroughly engrossing storyline with human characters you actually care about something i couldnt say the same thing about with apple tv pluses monarch legacy of monsters in my opinion    as mentioned the characters and story were true standouts and godzilla was portrayed as the most fierce and menacing monster ive ever seen before onscreen through so many films over the years when this monster is walking you genuinely feel the tremendous impact with every footstep taken    loved the character arc for the lead actor and for those not familiar with why this total was chosen its done with reference to japan being characterized at level zero in terms of the state of fragility with this country following the conclusion of world war 2 and with this new ever menacing threat its now a step below this    great actions sequences and a feelgood movie that delivers in spades superbly crafted the director takashi yamazaki has said he will take his time as far as coming up with a great sequel and im completely fine with this take all the time you need if it means something similar here can be redone with new aspects     loved some of the careful and proper nods paid by the director to classic thriller movies before this like jaws for one extremely well done
Feb 15 2024,positive,perfection hollywood has everything to learn from this gem though i do enjoy the monsterverse films theyre nowhere near the level of artistry this film has to spare as good as could be hoped for  and then some i love this film and am still angry i wasnt able to see the monochrome version in theater hoping theyll both be on the bluray  that its released sooner than later
Feb 14 2024,positive,not only the best godzilla movie but the best possible godzilla movie maybe its just that most of the other godzilla movies arent that great but in my opinion there is nowhere else to go from here because minus one is perfect shakespeares tragedies absolutely cannot match the absolute despair i felt when i realized i couldnt put six stars
Feb 14 2024,positive,beautiful and well made movie i saw three times in theaters and cannot wait to own this forever
Feb 13 2024,positive,the best film of 2023 great script excellent visual effects fantastic performances an emotional and great film simply the best japanese film ive ever seen
Feb 13 2024,positive,yep this is it the best movie of 2023 no questions asked take notes hollywood
Feb 13 2024,positive,this movie kicked ass no lie you think youre getting an monster mash movie which is fine those are fun but youre getting a deeply layered earnest story about family love bravery mental trauma courage and the value of a human life scary monster good effects great story wonderfully done
Feb 13 2024,positive,one of the best films to come out in the past few years in my humble opinion excellent story writing dialogue to action ratio is well balanced some of the most compelling characters ive ever seen portrayed in a film and a great musical soundtrack way to go japan keep it up 
Feb 11 2024,positive,a surprising win we loved it
Feb 10 2024,positive,this movie was breath taking with stunning effects godzilla minus one is my favourite godzilla movie in the franchise and one of my favourite movies ever
Feb 10 2024,positive,this movie was so beautiful i did not expect something so emotional and powerful a great godzilla intro movie i think a great combination of action and plot that leaves you wanting to learn more about godzilla if you dont already know
Feb 9 2024,positive,utterly terrifying and riveting movie on godzilla
Feb 8 2024,positive,one of the best films i have seen in a while the design of godzilla was phenomenal and i was left speechless during the scenes which featured him the soundtrack too wow    also i felt fully connected to all of the characters who led most of the story i understood their motives and decision making and felt strong emotions to the twists and turns of the film   it showed the braver side of humanity during a time of big hollywood films demonising different groups   i forgot i was reading subtitles for most of the film a truly fantastic watch that i highly recommend you see
Feb 8 2024,positive,this might be one if the best films ive ever seen it really felt like an authentic film the story freaky sucks you in godzilla wasnt even the star of the first half of the time and by the time he makes a reappearance youre invested into the characters  and feel the pain they go through
Feb 7 2024,positive,surprisingly good always amazed and should not be but it is what it is when i see such emotion and silliness and  humaness in the asian characters obviously prefer to see a movie without subtitles but this was a real surprise and very good fun even
Feb 7 2024,positive,ive always been a fan of godzilla but this movie is spectacular great story and incredible visual effects godzilla movies are usually just escapist fun but this movie has a very heavy plot dealing with ptsd and loss it also treats godzilla as a terrifying bad guy in the true sense of his origin also got to see this movie a second time in 4dx wow if you get the chance  do it
Feb 6 2024,positive,this movie was amazing this design of godzilla was downright one of the best and the human characters were great maybe the acting was pretty forced but the movie writers put so much work into making the characters great and compelling and you critics who rate these movies on their cgi just shut up seriously its so stupid even if we were grading movies on their cgi godzilla minus one would be praised which it is this movie did so much for a budget that was only 10 to 15 million dollars and i hope that there is a new movie that takes 5 years to make if it takes one year i fear for the integrity of the first godzilla films
Feb 6 2024,positive,best movie of 2023 easily
Feb 6 2024,positive,one of the best godzilla film ive seen for a long time
Feb 6 2024,positive,such a great movie to watch a fresh of breath air to the copy paste formula hollywood has since replicated the movie although is titled godzilla is very much about people how they relate to each other especially after losing ww2 how they try to heal from that when all of a sudden theyre all faced with the enormous obstacle that is godzilla
Feb 6 2024,positive,i grew up on godzilla mostly the american version but this outdid anything the legendary put out by a long shot and legendary is my favorite godzilla i watch legendary all of the time but this is the perfect movie to balance the dumb kaiju fights with serious and villainous godzilla loved it top of the line movie would most definitely recommend to anyone
Feb 6 2024,positive,its the best take on a godzilla movie yet you actually get the human perspective
Feb 6 2024,negative,movie is horrible its the worst movie about godzilla
Feb 6 2024,positive,ive seen this 3 times 2 in color and 1 in bw  this is the best version of godzilla since the original in 1954 and a welcome respite from mcu and the monsterverse   ive also seen all the major films in 2023 and i would rate this even or just above oppenheimer  it is that good  the only disappointment is that they pulled it to make way for another monsterverse film which after this masterpiece can only disappoint us  this movie has set the bar that high
Feb 5 2024,positive,this movie is the best movie you have to see this movie because how much money it made is worth it because first is how great it looks please give this movie 1010 now theaters plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Feb 5 2024,positive,godzilla was fantastic   just not enough of him   instead we get sappy love story

Feb 3 2024,positive,watched the decolorized version fantastic movie uses godzilla as a tool to drive the humancentric story in my inexperienced opinion it succeeds in transporting the viewer back in time to japan shortly after the war

Feb 2 2024,positive,awesome movie though not really a fan of the godzilla series i might have seen one or two of them during my teenage years or even of monster movies in general i found this to be thoroughly entertaining from beginning to end the story was more interesting to me than the monster itself  but various scenes involving the monster were quite compelling probably my favorite movie of 2023 even though i saw only this the bw version in february 2024 it didnt really look lowbudget to me the sets and cinematography totally brought me making suspension of disbelief work in most every way except when it came to the monster
Feb 2 2024,positive,my two sons and i love the movie even though wantt colors well at least has english sub
Feb 2 2024,positive,an instant classic most likely the greatest godzilla movie since the original monochrome was a nice added touch that made me possibly prefer it a smidge over the color version
Feb 2 2024,positive,surprisingly one of the best movies ive seen this year
Feb 1 2024,positive,i liked the minus color first as it captured the feel of post world war ii era but my review for this movie is the same as my review with that version perfection from the characters less but more effective  terrifying screen time for godzilla and an efficient way to spend the production budget that delivered so much more than the modern movies as of late this deserves an award for that alone in hollywood and they should really take notes 5 stars
Feb 1 2024,positive,sensational  in color and bw
Feb 1 2024,positive,dear hollywood    when making monster movies moving forward you should really take notes from godzilla minus one keep the human drama front and center while also having it feel compelling that way the audience can have characters to latch onto from start to finish especially after sht hits the fan incredible vfx work made all the more impressive by the fact that this film was made on such a low budget magnificently scored too
Feb 1 2024,positive,i loved loved loved every single second of it everyone need to go see it
Feb 1 2024,positive,excellent movie godzilla minus oneminus color was great to watch in this format evoking memories of the original film but with much more enhancements due to the special effects a must see
Feb 1 2024,positive,loved it no matter what version
Feb 1 2024,positive,totally japanese totally serious
Feb 1 2024,positive,an incredible collaborative effort on all parts that legitimately brought me to tears as a longtime kaiju fan this transcends the campy nature of the genre and was effectively scary despite the ridiculous premise the only downfall is the sequel foreshadowing i wish we could purge these moments from modern storytelling
Feb 1 2024,positive,an absolutely epic gritty terrifying and beautiful thrill ride one of the best films ive seen in a long time this will be a timeless classic
Jan 31 2024,positive,best japanese version of godzilla since its inception 70 years ago the story and visuals are even made better with the decolorization black  white only makes this movie more enjoyable with the aftermath of world war ii backstory hats off to toho studios

Jan 30 2024,positive,the main character has an obsession with being a kamikaze 110 idea its not that great but the godzilla attacking tokyo scenes are pretty good  if you like japanese godzilla movies well youre probably going to watch it anyways

Jan 30 2024,positive,ive seen every godzilla movie ever made this is hands down the greatest one its an underdog story about redemption for not only the central characters but the country as well there wont be a dry eye in the house at the end watching godzilla minus one reminds me of the power of film with a focus spend your money on movies like these and not the garbage that has infected the modern movie industry     we need to unmarvelize our standards as moviegoers and this is a perfect starting point to demand quality and heart in our films
Jan 30 2024,positive,truly a amazing movie

Jan 29 2024,positive,fantastic old school feel great story and characters and the godzilla moments are
Jan 29 2024,positive,it was just as good as the colored version the only complaint i have for it is the missed opportunity to make godzillas atomic breath be colored blue as the rest remains grey
Jan 29 2024,positive,why this movie is not up for best foreign movie i do not know  an amazing historic drama that incorporates an oversized monster but still feels believable and the audience caring for the characters
Jan 29 2024,positive,for some context i missed the first theatrical release and saw the minus color version after hearing about the nominations  while i havent seen it in color to me the visual effects felt almost like a surreal blend of modern cgi and the goofy to our modern eye classic rubbersuit practical effects  my gut is telling me it looks a lot more modern in color    that being said  the film holds up to an awardwinning rating even without relying on its effects  characters were compelling pacing and editing are extremely tight and the entire thing feels like a timeless cinematic classic  what if godzilla but with miyazaki levels of charm and kurosawa levels of thematic depth
Jan 29 2024,positive,amazing  the most well thought out emotional and terrifying   godzilla film highly recommended 
Jan 29 2024,positive,what can be said about it that hasnt already been its big g at his best both narratively and visually japan may be at minus one but godzilla is back at one hundred percent
Jan 29 2024,positive,it was hard to keep up with the subtitles sometimes but overall it was good
Jan 29 2024,positive,godzilla minus one is absolutley the best godzilla film in the franchise and this is coming from a die hard godzilla fan collector and connoisseur and just when you think it cant get better it does godzilla minus one minus color is even better the bw version is simply magnificent its like a whole new movie plays like a documentary of real events and ups the ante takashi yamazaki outdid himself again not only should this win the oscar for best vfx it should have been nominated and should have won best picture brilliance
Jan 29 2024,positive,the movie reminded me of the older original godzilla movies  it was also a wonderful monster movie
Jan 29 2024,positive,a unique and enjoyable way to experience an already amazing movie
Jan 29 2024,positive,part of me regrets seeing it first in color special effects are great heat ray charge up is iconic chefs kiss to the roar and score better heros journey  redemption arc than anything in the recent star wars trilogy though the twist requires a suspension of belief a little too high for me
Jan 29 2024,positive,emotional dark and scary  something godzilla hasnt been in decades this is a must watch

Jan 28 2024,positive,loved it passionate actors in a genre that was new to me godzilla the monster was very nostalgic and this setting was perfect for the film the story of the pilot was gripping as was his life after the war putting pieces back together and having a future that is hopeful very well done
Jan 28 2024,positive,absolutely a must see  godzilla minus one 2023  no one told me to bring tissues to a godzilla movie all joking aside this is an amazing movie      a 15mm movie that completely outclasses higher budget godzilla movies serves only to prove that you need a good story compelling characters and well crafted cinematography to deliver a compelling cinematic experience    try to catch on big screen but i believe this translates very well to the smaller screen

Jan 27 2024,positive,ive definitely seen more godzilla movies than the average viewer due to being friends with some absolute nerds 3 so i can add my verification that this is one of if not the best godzilla movie made typically i either find the destruction funnylackluster or the human story unnecessary and dull but this one aced both sides the characters were each memorable and had excellent actors they all contributed to give a strong sense of humanity in a time of crisis in a way that was deeper than previous godzilla movies this gave the destruction and devastating parts a truly epic feel that none of the characters just walked off afterward this godzilla monster caused a deepseated dread in me while watching which is something this franchise is either really good at or fails terribly at all in all a truly great movie
Jan 27 2024,positive,the only bad thing that can be said about this film is godzilla has strange eyes this is a must watch

Jan 26 2024,positive,i think the film is suppose to be like films back in the 1940s so its unusual to modern day movies  the actors emote too much and there is a bit of a cheesy factor consequently  the tempo is plodding  godzilla is cool  an effective job was done with the monster
Jan 26 2024,positive,best movie ive seen in a while
Jan 26 2024,positive,a beautiful movie with godzilla in it
Jan 25 2024,positive,best movie ive seen this year
Jan 25 2024,positive,i seen this film for the 3rd time and it still surprises me how great everything is and more tears flow the more i watch godzilla 01 its the acting story and production that make this  film movie of the year maybe decade and rock on to hollywood by showing how much the elites appreciate a masterpiece from a foreign country     wait they skipped over the movie and ignored it huh but the academy gave 12 oscars to titanic and its lack of respect for the tradgic  deaths by creating a fake plot for the love of scrouge mcduck moneys but not this how you say the word that you can call a person who is self centered shameless bottom feeding spinless soulless gutless envy fueled and phoney baloney filled hypocrite  
Jan 25 2024,positive,im not as high on it as many others seem to be but godzilla minus one is a pretty good film there are no huge surprises

Jan 25 2024,positive,i cant think of a better film to see in 2023 or 2024 from the beautiful visuals to the incredible story everything in godzilla minus one is over the top the story of the little girl akiko is extremely sad and even i was broken up over her situation and the girl playing akiko did a phenomenal job she was more believable than most adult actors today hands down this is one of the absolute best films ive ever seen watch it watch it watch it and when it goes bluray buy yourself a copy and all of your friends copies too
Jan 25 2024,positive,awesome movie with outstanding pacing and a superb musical score acting was great and told a powerful story
Jan 25 2024,positive,a real movie unlike some godzilla movies    well written and acted  takes us back to the very early days of godzilla after the war before godzilla had become the hero defender of japan  you could almost say godzilla is the war or the united states    well worth seeing more than once
Jan 24 2024,positive,im a lifelong godzilla fan ive seen every godzilla film both from toho and american godzilla films this film was a masterpiece of godzilla storytelling i normally dont care for human characters in a godzilla film in this film i actually care for all the characters and want them to live godzilla himself my god this is the scariest godzilla in all of his films i loved this film its my new favorite godzilla film of all time see it

Jan 24 2024,positive,the first godzilla movie that manages to create human characters that the audience will actually care about  shockingly good and well told story
Jan 24 2024,negative,i am perplexed why so many people rate this movie so highly  as a lifelong godzilla fan i was sorely disappointed after the rave reviews  the acting is not good  the character development makes no sense and is full of holes  the plot again full of holes and unrealistic in an uncreative way  they could have done so much better  underwhelmed and perplexed but im glad yall liked it so much
Jan 24 2024,positive,the soundtracks and the essence of godzilla are very strong points of this film in addition to the fact that they knew how to take advantage of the budget they had
Jan 24 2024,positive,this movie kept true to godzilla classic fashion the acting action storyline and graphics were top tier loved it
Jan 23 2024,positive,the best godzilla movie ive ever seen and tied for the best movie i saw in 2023 phenomenal human drama with a godzilla that is legitimately terrifying who knew you could cry during a monster movie highly recommended
Jan 23 2024,positive,minus one was one of those movies that felt like a remake of its original godzilla minus one is one of those movies if you were new to the series and if it comes ready for the sequel if it comes
Jan 23 2024,positive,its kind of surprising to find a touching human drama in the midst of a monster movie but there it is great characters and a very entertaining
Jan 23 2024,positive,this film is fantastic in every sense  storyline characters music the music is brilliant and special effects  this is unlike any godzilla film youve ever seen  its about the people not the monster  the human emotion story is very strong  lose any preconceived ideas you might have of a godzilla film and watch this  its a must watch
Jan 23 2024,positive,this movie perfectly captures the horror that godzilla initially was bringing the terror and fear and sadness that godzilla brought the movie has a great story characters score and the visual effects were outstanding not just a good godzilla movie a good movie in general one for everyone godzilla fans or not to enjoy
Jan 22 2024,positive,thats what i call cinema  a great movie  better than a us blockbuster 
Jan 22 2024,positive,very awsome to any godzilla fan and even if you dont know the story or series its still very enjoyable
Jan 22 2024,positive,pretty good was expecting better from all the amazing reviews but solid the twist wasnt a twist and the female characters were weak and no great character arcs anywhere but it had heart
Jan 22 2024,positive,best godzilla movie of all time
Jan 22 2024,negative,what movie did others watch this is laughingly bad for a moment at the beginning of the movie i thought it would be different original and elevated with the kamikaze pilot story line but then it quickly descended in predictable cliches outrageous larger than life acting with exaggerated body movements  and everybody in the back of the theater needs to be able to hear this stage line delivery 15 minutes of a nonscary so slow moving obese godzilla and 1 hour 45 minutes of sentimental hollywood type fare minus the true spectacle
Jan 22 2024,positive,great story and amazing rendering of godzilla takes the best of old school 1970s godzilla and updates to a modern quality but also a great personal story for the characters
Jan 22 2024,positive,this movie is the epitome of perfection
Jan 22 2024,positive,old school godzilla in a new fresh way great character development and story as well
Jan 22 2024,positive,movie was absolutely stellar and riveting story telling made this a great piece of cinema

Jan 22 2024,positive,the absolute peak of monster movies
Jan 21 2024,positive,an amazing movie from start to finish had everything from action to a great storyline i highly recommend this movie to anyone even if youre not a godzilla fan
Jan 21 2024,positive,honestly this movie is a complete throwback to the original 1954 movie its not just a guy in a suit or cgi but it feels real the characters are great there can be over reacting here and there but overall top five best movies in my opinion

Jan 21 2024,positive,one of the best godzilla movies ever
Jan 21 2024,positive,yeah you must catch this in the cinema if you want to watch something that reflects the heart of the godzilla story its beautiful well paced fantastically acted romp although the zilla beat intro kept throwing me to simon says  well done japanyoure awesome
Jan 21 2024,positive,thank you thank you thank you die hard og godzilla fan right here from day 1
Jan 21 2024,positive,great story not just interested in godzilla but everything else that is being affected impressed
Jan 21 2024,positive,fantastic story and super fun godzilla angle very enjoyable
Jan 21 2024,negative,it was ok i high higher expectation based on feedback and ratings very slow at times i wouldnt recommend it
Jan 20 2024,positive,awesome movie with outstanding pacing and a superb musical score acting was great and told a powerful story 
Jan 20 2024,positive,as an avid godzilla fan this was character driven plot driven had some light messaging which informed us of japanese culture during and post war and the godzilla music right when you just started to miss it i cant wait to see it again in minus color this is easily the best godzilla movie out of all the us and japanese movies go see it
Jan 20 2024,positive,saw my 1rst godzilla movie over 50 years ago this one did not disappoint i would recommend seeing one of the original 50s60s movies before seeing godzilla minus one and you will see how far they have come  loved it
Jan 20 2024,positive,easily a great movie godzilla really feels real the acting is insanely perfect plot is great this is a movie you will never forget
Jan 20 2024,positive,this film is a masterpiece the perfect balance of an incredibly compelling human interest story and actionblockbuster elements that put to shame anything ive seen in the past decade its an absolute event and it sticks with you true greatness
Jan 20 2024,positive,this movie gave me the will to live
Jan 20 2024,positive,such a beautiful movie a cinematic masterpiece if you will definitely a must watch for any godzilla fan
Jan 20 2024,positive,best movie of the year awesome action crazy suspense a dark and sad tone and a incredible 2 act we will be hungry for more films like this
Jan 20 2024,positive,this movie is jaws meets jurassic park meets akira kurosawa  this movie is amazing and it shows whats wrong with so many american action movies  the characters are so compelling  unlike so many monster movies the story between the human characters is as important  or maybe more important  than the story about the monster  this is a truly great movie  my only criticism is that very occasionally some of the special effects are a little substandard but given that the movie only cost 15 million it is amazing  full of heart a little humor lovable characters and great action  go see it in the theater
Jan 19 2024,positive,closed captions were not a problem    positive life affirming theme overcame a silly godzilla plot well what do i expect in regards to intelligent plot and such its a godzilla movie crying out loud
Jan 19 2024,positive,excellent story and so much depth  and action
Jan 19 2024,positive,definitely not a typical godzilla movie and thats a good thing this is more of a war drama following the traumatic experiences of a failed kamikaze pilot along with the residents of a warravaged tokyo godzilla is more of a secondary character and a symbol of another enemy combatant that allows retribution for our main character well written and a superb and refreshing godzilla movie which does have plenty of action when godzilla attacks with a couple of unexpected twists along the way
Jan 19 2024,positive,godzilla1 rocked my world its not just a monster flick it taps into deep fears and societal stuff visually stunning emotionally gripping  a wild ride for sure  hands down its the best godzilla film to date
Jan 19 2024,positive,absolutely blew me away
Jan 18 2024,positive,there was only a singular showing of this movie in my country i spent a lot of money on a cab home afterwards since the public transport was out costing me 7 times more than the ticket but damn was it worth it
Jan 18 2024,positive,great movie it brings old school godzilla back to life in an incredible way its the most pissed off godzilla ive ever seen lol the story lineplot was great and the acting was very good always loved godzilla growing up and this movie did him justice unlike a lot of the other new ones 
Jan 18 2024,positive,i took my son and we both liked the movie it kept my attention right from the start i thought the effects were good i would watch again
Jan 18 2024,positive,this movie of godzilla is so good and i think the movie can have a sequel why the final scene godzilla regenerates in the deep of the ocean and the sequel according to the director will be in development
Jan 18 2024,positive,a little bloated but godzilla holds a very strong presence on the screen yet the monster doesnt completely steal the spotlight the character development and story line is attention grabbing and we still have a massive lizard breaking things pretty cool
Jan 18 2024,positive,i enjoyed this film godzilla looked so real and terrifying and the acting was great
Jan 18 2024,positive,special effects excellent and the plot line was good too  view of their government was surprising and provoking  great sound too on the downside the movie was a little too long overall
Jan 18 2024,positive,best godzilla movie ive ever seen  classic godzilla themes and pitch perfect japanese cast with modern special effects and great cinematography  fun watch even with the subtitles
Jan 18 2024,positive,for the first time since the original 1954 godzilla movie i actually cared about the human characters in a kaiju movie unlike most other films about giant monsters this one focuses more on the struggles of trying to rebuild after everything has been destroyed and it works beautifully you really feel for these characters and you get tense and worry when the titular monster rampage is its way back into their lives   godzilla himself has been taken back to his roots as the villain of the flick hes a being of pure destruction an unstoppable force of nature that cant be reckoned with and its perfect   in my opinion this is by far the best godzilla movie and it a strong contender for my favourite film of 2023
Jan 18 2024,positive,special effects were top notch  the acting in very japanese style all in all godzilla was bad ass
Jan 17 2024,positive,hands down the best godzilla movie ever and one of the best movies ive ever seen can not think of a single negative critique of this film even the parts that felt like familiar tropes kept me engaged because i was so emotionally invested must see
Jan 17 2024,positive,this was a beautiful actionfantasy movie absolutely wonderful in every respect and so emotionally engaging this movie is destined to be a classic of its genre im not at all surprised that the best movie of the year did not come out of hollywood
Jan 17 2024,positive,top notch godzilla great story with a truly scary monster
Jan 17 2024,positive,amazing movie best ive seen in a long time
Jan 17 2024,positive,this is how godzilla movies should be made  it was refreshing not routing for godzilla for a change
Jan 17 2024,positive,this is the best kind of monster scifi movie one that doesnt rely on blood and gore for its suspense but built entirely on its plot line human drama and minimal yet incredibly welltimed use of creature actionviolence
Jan 17 2024,positive,a triumph how many movies called thrilling genuinely thrill you how many dramas can actually break your heart this film is a rare and stunning masterwork highly recommend a theater viewing
Jan 17 2024,positive,as a godzilla fan from the 80s this is one of the best movies ive seen in a long time great visuals and sounds highly recommend to see in the big screen
Jan 17 2024,positive,amazing movie all throughout but the ending couldve been better

Jan 16 2024,positive,action from beginning to end great acting great story best godzilla movie ive ever seen must see
Jan 16 2024,positive,incredible production characters i loved the definition and quality of the film i think that in the medium and long term it could be very well received by the public or the audience in general the music selected highlighted the role of the characters and this type of cinematic design is incredible
Jan 16 2024,negative,do you really need me to tell you why it sux
Jan 16 2024,positive,a perfect performance from all the actors the cgi is very great but the acting is impeccable
Jan 16 2024,positive,one of the greatest movies i have ever seen
Jan 16 2024,positive,the best godzilla movie yet
Jan 16 2024,positive,good music fun and exciting 
Jan 16 2024,positive,good action film w heart
Jan 16 2024,positive,it is totally wild how this ends up being my pick for best movie of the year despite oppenheimer barbie and killers of the flower moon all being an amazing benchmark and yet it was i thought i was walking into an another monster movie but thats only part of what this movie is last thing i will say is i really would not wait for this to come to dvdbr unless you have an excellent sound system because the sound design and music are second to none go see this in the theaters where godzilla is the large and terrifying creature its meant to be and your eardrums will thank you
Jan 15 2024,positive,it kept me on the edge of my seat
Jan 15 2024,positive,this film was phenomenal please make more movies like this
Jan 15 2024,positive,simply amazing special effects are sublime and the story line is not just big monster action but people centric too the best godzilla yet
Jan 15 2024,positive,of all the movies ive seen about godzilla this one is by far the best
Jan 15 2024,positive,i wish it was a more english version movie
Jan 15 2024,positive,as usual nippon entertainment never dissapoints amazing  real actors no ridiculous plots nothing forced    i enjoyed it so much   learn something hollywood i bet youll never do
Jan 15 2024,positive,i have been a fan of godzilla since i was a little boy i have seen the original 50s version all the way up to newer installments this movie takes godzilla back to its roots and makes the human side of the story on top of that very interesting normally i dont  care about the characters not named godzilla this movie changed that the writing was incredible and the acting was top notch that combined with the great special effects  visuals and action make this a great movie i would say not only is this now my favorite godzilla movie of all time but also just a great movie in general even if you have no experience with godzilla feel free to go watch this movie you will not be disappointed
Jan 15 2024,positive,before to watch it i read the reviews and i absolutely agree is a must
Jan 15 2024,positive,one of the best versions of godzilla
Jan 15 2024,positive,what a surprise this was  engaging emotional human story wrapped around a monster movie is how i describe it  loss sacrifice redemption it runs the whole gambit  i dont think ive ever shed a tear while watching a godzilla movie before
Jan 15 2024,positive,this movie was overhyped  i love monster movies with monsters big or small  this movie had a lot of hype and well it did not live up to it  it did have more backstory for characters that were no godzilla so that was different and good  the special effects were ok and i do not need top notch stuff to enjoy a good film  the story i thought stole scenes from jaws  weird  the acting i thought was a bit over the top  overall worth a watch but average at best
Jan 15 2024,positive,the storyline and pace are slower than other godzilla movies and there are less action scenes with destruction but the godzilla scenes are enjoyable
Jan 15 2024,positive,i saw this film with my son he is the biggest godzilla fan i have ever know after taking him to many of the newest in the godzilla installments i have to say this one was so captivating   i went several years ago to see shin godzilla not expecting much however i completely enjoyed it   with godzilla minus one i was blown away a great story and plot excellent actors and not a moment of boredom as a casual godzilla fan i truly feel this is among the top five of all time
Jan 15 2024,positive,honestly this is the first godzilla movie where i really cared about the human characters and were rooting for them to take down the kaiju the story is wellpaced and heartpounding and the scenes with godzilla are visually stunning and terrifying amazing
Jan 15 2024,positive,godzilla minus one is rousing entertainment on a grand scale totally happily fulfilling in every way you may want to resist  youve seen godzilla before right not like this and not in a movie this enjoyable    full review    
Jan 15 2024,negative,i have high expectations on this based on stories heard from the media it was a borefest highly predictable and histrionic ignoring the monster i have to suspend believe when it comes to plot how easy to find his damsel in decimated tokyo in the most populated city in the world easier than buying my coffee at pret  at least theres a queue he just walk right up to meet her in the middle of it all a sailor walked into control centre to declare hes actually is the nations top scientist wtaf     ive grown up watching japanese films never have i expect the acting is still this ott it is distracting it is one dimensional every actor has the same expression the worst is kuranosuke sasaki he becomes hysterical with every scene even at dinner muscle clenged eyes bulging and mouth wide ajar its excruciating to watch     it is cheesy it is predictable and godzilla is so prosthetic expect the expected reminiscent of 90s hollywood big budget disaster films from michael bay and roland emmerich minus the slow motion its the same  everyone survives everyone claps in the end ctrlc ctrlv
Jan 15 2024,positive,this is a great movie   i liked so much godzilla
Jan 15 2024,positive,absolutely loved it glad there was much more of a human element to the story than just a monster movie ok i cried
Jan 14 2024,positive,i criedat a godzilla movieand not from laughter  nuff said
Jan 14 2024,positive,had the choice of the original japanese with subtitles or dubed in spanish definately better in japanese
Jan 14 2024,positive,one of the most competently made movie i have seen i awhile does for godzilla what christopher nolan did for batman godzilla is not the star but the actor thats a conflicted former kamakazi pilot any veteran can understand him just very well made written and acted movie
Jan 14 2024,positive,yooooo this movie is better than any godzilla movie has the right to be if i saw this when it came out in december of 2023 this movie would easily be in the top three movies i saw of that year go see it
Jan 14 2024,positive,mainly the godzilla movies bore me godzilla comes out very little time or the humans are very boring but this movie is a big exception the human characters are really charismatic and their stories really interesting and the ending really moved me and left me with a good taste in my mouth knowing that the protagonist ended up being happy its my favorite movie of all time to tell the truth
Jan 14 2024,positive,absolute cinema honestly best godzilla movie everything you want to see in a monster movie is here a piece of art
Jan 14 2024,positive,good movietrue godzillathe monster
Jan 14 2024,positive,unexpectedly amazing one of the best godzilla movies ever this one has a soul  a heart great direction
Jan 14 2024,positive,why does it only have a 98 i deserves 100 it was soooo good the cgi was amazing the story was dramatic i loved it  those are just my heart colors nothing to do with the movie
Jan 14 2024,positive,good movie and great to
Jan 14 2024,positive,fantastic compelling thoughtful
Jan 14 2024,positive,this movie is a interesting i think that this is the best movie
Jan 14 2024,positive,it was so cool how they created an old movie and made it look real
Jan 14 2024,positive,the most emotionally indepth monster movie ever created
Jan 14 2024,positive,it is a good entertaining movie and can be enjoyed in company i give it an excellent rating because it has good things
Jan 14 2024,positive,absolute masterpiece  the storytelling in this movie was amazing and it tugs on the heart strings throughout  you would expect that a movie barely featuring godzilla wouldnt really entice fans of the series but the monster is so well done and its rare appearances so spectacular that youre just waiting with bated breath until the next time he does pop up on the screen  godzilla was always intended as a cautionary tale about the danger of nuclear weaponry and this movie returns to the series roots in glorious fashion  they did a tremendous job of conveying the raw destructive power of godzilla but do yourself a favor and see this in theaters so you can truly experience it in all its glory  my only complaint is that they changed godzillas iconic roar
Jan 14 2024,positive,only cared about the scenes with godzilla couldnt care too much about the barely fleshed out characters i do see what they were doing though and it made it the best godzilla movie by far however the plot is so basic that i wasnt intrigued all that much but this makes a great theater experience with the godzilla sequences
Jan 14 2024,positive,loved every moment great movie
Jan 14 2024,positive,the single best monster movie ever not just a great godzilla film but a great film with truly impressive sfx and a surprisingly gutwrenching emotional wallop 10 out of 10
Jan 14 2024,positive,its mostly centers around a guy dealing with trauma
Jan 14 2024,positive,this is one of the best movies ive seen for years i really wouldnt change anything about it
Jan 13 2024,positive,great wartime movie must watch
Jan 13 2024,positive,really enjoyable movie with a lot of classic references and throwbacks with modern cinematography cant wait to see where they go from here
Jan 13 2024,positive,even though the cgi wasnt the best ive seen it has an excellent story the action scenes were great especially the theme song used for godzilla i really enjoyed the movie from beginning to end
Jan 13 2024,positive,a liftle slow at the start but was really good
Jan 13 2024,positive,there are good moments but i was intensely aware of the editing process and the lack of sense in the sequence of scenes the last scenes shouldve been the most intense but it was so disjointed it felt like random events from different movies the characters motivations didnt follow the facts laid down by the film and then their actions didnt follow their motivations as laid out by the film the character growth was undermined by the deus ex machina undoing meaningful choices the monster design face looks like a sea lion with a big clown grin and for some reason they gave it human eyes with big stone eyebrows that say angry which is just too goofy the body is identical to barney character in the childrens show it stands and walks like a fat naked toddler taking its first steps the boats behaved like cars they simply parked in rows in the ocean the main character was the only character with any depth the monster was a slow lumbering moron then a whiplash fast clever opponent but then a lumbering moron again
Jan 13 2024,positive,my head exploded 
Jan 13 2024,positive,fast pacing and emotionally poignant godzilla minus one lives up to its name with its title character as a terrifying monster for once
Jan 13 2024,positive,the overall feel of the movie is amazing it has you routing for the humans to win godzilla is terrifying it also reminds me of the 1954 godzilla music is amazing definitely one of the best godzilla movies
Jan 13 2024,positive,best monster movie since jawsand like jaws this movie makes you care about the people not just the monster  amazing movie
Jan 12 2024,positive,second time seeing it great movie
Jan 12 2024,positive,this is simply the best godzilla film ever made i wanted the characters to live and wasnt cheering for godzilla to win hollywood cant invoke that    and godzilla was terrifying to look at amazing    15 million budget hollywood you have been shown the door
Jan 12 2024,positive,they went old school with the monsters presence and it totally worked the human drama fit perfectly with the overall plot which is rare for a movie like this i think this will go down in history as one of few perfect movies
Jan 12 2024,positive,the best godzilla movie since the first on in 1954
Jan 12 2024,positive,a solid personal story line interesting context of postwar japan and of course great monster
Jan 12 2024,positive,this is the best godzilla film ever made and the best film of 2023 first and foremost godzilla is scary this is the most menacing depiction of the legendary kaiju and two sequences in particular had me gripping my seat the visual effects are breathtaking and better than anything hollywood has put out in years godzillas main city attack must be seen on the biggest screen possible  the mayhem destruction menace and sound should be experienced in imax theaters all that aside the heart of the film is the characters this is the only godzilla film to date in which the characters are so well developed that you care about each and every one of them the finale will tug at heart strings and i heard some sniffles in the theater when the credits rolled applause erupted with myself included     godzilla minus one  an epic astonishing cinematic achievement the best godzilla film of all time and easily the best film of 2023 go see it
Jan 12 2024,positive,happiest ive been leaving the theater in 2 years killer movie   spoiler alert  godzilla is kind of a jerk
Jan 12 2024,positive,this was the best and greatest godzilla movie of all time the human characters were perfect godzilla was an absolute menace and the music was pure perfection highly recommend watching this movie
Jan 12 2024,positive,best godzilla ive ever seen  definitely worth 98 on rotten tomatoes
Jan 12 2024,positive,loved it best movie of 2023 great characters godzilla made you feel like he was a natural disaster
Jan 12 2024,positive,best film ive seen in theaters since they reopened wonderful moving story coupled with incredible acting and great visuals blows all american godzilla adaptations out of the water highly recommend seeing it in theaters while you still can
Jan 12 2024,positive,this movie is proof that you can make a blockbuster and still tell an important even emotional story  hollywood should take note of this one  one of the best of 2023
Jan 11 2024,positive,gripping thriller  loved the story the characters and the cgi special effects  best godzilla movie ever
Jan 11 2024,positive,absolute incredible
Jan 11 2024,positive,godzila minus one was amazing before i watched it i thought it being in japanese would be bad but the subtitles were very good and easy to read the movie doesnt have the most diolauge so i dont mind it the cgi wasnt the best at times but it still looked amazing the ending was okay but it could have been a bit better the sfx were amazing and the movie all around was fanominal and i would highly recomend watching it the progression of the main charecter was great and it was an all around great story
Jan 11 2024,positive,godzilla minus one proves just how solid direction and a darker tone on a character as old as him can still be entertaining and thrilling after all these years    the movie exceeds in its visuals and atmosphere to sell you on the setting of a postwar japan which is now under threat of a greater evil when godzilla is on the screen the scenes are great theyre engaging and tense which is exactly what you want with a movie like this alongside with a set of characters with some decently good performances to boot    where this movie lacks is the character development being quite minimal for everyone besides the central character this isnt an automatic issue but these additional side characters felt more like props to the main character rather than individuals with their own morales and personalities it comes across as the movie as a whole contains only 3 characters shikishima the main character the side characters and godzilla    godzilla just being a force of nature with a clear murderous intent to cause death and destruction everywhere he goes its shallow but works for the style of character he plays in the movie and the side characters play nothing more than the prop that pushes shikishima forward theres some small exceptions to this but theyre never shown more than a few minutes of screentime and automatically conclude with blending into the same formula everyone else plays into its extremely jarring how lacking these side characters feel when we get so many scenes around them     this added onto how predictable and cliché the movie ends if you knew how it was going to end when watching you were likely correct it doesnt ruin the experience and ill happily rewatch it when it gets posted on streaming or a physical copy release however the movie had so much potential to be so much more yet ended up being a pretty inoffensive and by the books movie    one which im happy people enjoy but i think after almost 70 years we deserve so much better
Jan 11 2024,positive,a story about love loss  redemption you wouldnt think id be talking about a godzilla movie but indeed we are godzilla returns and this time hes menacing terrifying and absolutely unstoppable an extraordinary film that taps into the heart of what it means to be courageous in our darkest hour extremely well developed characters that take us on this journey often times forgetting were watching a godzilla movie incredible scenes of destruction balanced with an emotional story and unforgettable characters
Jan 11 2024,positive,fantastic film all around  the soundtrack is great as is the drama and cgi  the low budget is incredible considering the movies quality
Jan 11 2024,positive,godzilla minus one is one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life easily 5 stars
Jan 11 2024,positive,best film of 2023  its not even close
Jan 11 2024,positive,minus one is a masterpiece     it stands right along other greats like shin 84 and biollante the characters are well written and do a great job of grounding the story goji is definitely cgi but he looks scarier than ever before the effects were good not as polished as the legendary movies as was the story it is 100 too scary for most kids under 12 for any parents wondering     this will be a day one 4k purchase for me do yourself a favor and see it as soon as you can
Jan 11 2024,positive,i really like the movie although very predictable ending it was well made but the movie was way too loud its one full day later and my ears hurt why was it so loud it was not worth it to watch the movie with the pain it has caused my ears
Jan 10 2024,positive,the best godzilla era
Jan 10 2024,positive,this movie perfectly gets the nostalgic feeling i got from watching the old godzilla movies paired it with well shown storytelling and depiction of of the effect ww2 ad ptsd had on soldiers especially japanese  the 98 rating of this movie at this point is quite spot on for me this movie was perfect up until the end where i stopped liking it as much  at least until i get to see a possible sequel  still besides me not liking the ending as much i really really liked the movie and it totally scratched that godzillaitch i have had
Jan 10 2024,positive,the movie eloquently brings in characters that make you care the story and plot of the movie is amazing and it makes you feel absorbed in the movie and other than that it looks amazing
Jan 10 2024,positive,best movie of 2023 by far and top 10 godzilla movie ever
Jan 10 2024,positive,definitely a fun watch
Jan 10 2024,positive,spectacular must see totally legit and fresh retelling
Jan 10 2024,positive,excellent movie    how did they pull this off with a 15m budget the sfx is superb and the storytelling is perfect you root for humans in this monster filmam i watching godzilla    hollywood take note gloves have been thrown just try and top this production with such a meager budget
Jan 10 2024,positive,this movie gripped me and had me on the edge of my seat the entire time a refreshing take on godzilla

Jan 10 2024,positive,this movie is awsome deffenitly reccomend it
Jan 10 2024,positive,it was subtitled but had a good storyline  godzilla is not in it very much but when he is its very exciting and the same theme song plays which we loved
Jan 10 2024,positive,im no critic but i love a good movie and this one has me writing about it absolutely amazing movie and they made that monster so monstrously destructive and despicable i hate godzilla all over again i cant wait to see some other monster come punch him in his heat ray spewing face  oh yeah the music is fantastic i think godzilla wrote it for himself wouldnt put it past that pompous city stomper im on japans side when it comes to godzilla and thats not my prius talking f that irradiated lizardthey cant find an ocean deep enough to bury him in
Jan 9 2024,positive,great story kept to the true japanese classic with phenomenal performance by all japanese cast the film score was amazing and godzilla was so real
Jan 9 2024,negative,godzilla minus one was fine if u wanted a emotional war drama but i think anyone who likes godzilla for being godzilla is there for monster stuff not human drama literally no new grounds being made on the titled character of the franchise instead we got 2 hours of some dude being sad after shin godzilla and that cliff hanger getting this movie feels like i died inside tat
Jan 9 2024,positive,wonderful character development and cinematic realism   i loved this movie
Jan 9 2024,positive,the best godzilla movie of all time with fantastic visuals characters that we care about and great godzilla action
Jan 9 2024,positive,this is the best godzilla movie ive ever seen  they just blew every american made godzilla movie out   of the water showing that in the words of late james brown    often imitated but never duplicated
Jan 9 2024,positive,oppenheimer and then watch gminus one  movie of the year thats all i got to say
Jan 9 2024,positive,i got a friend request we talked for a few hours and when i found out he was a fraud i ignored all his messages i honestly wouldnt have suspected him if not for the exposure of a professional hacker whom i hired after realizing my bitcoin wallet had been emptied i sincerely dont know how or why these fraudsters operate and if they know the pain and trauma they cause in the lives of their victims when i found my wallet had been emptied i nearly had a cardiac arrest i am a 58yearold taxi driver and i need money now more than ever i resolved to find ways to recover the stolen money and thats when i found cyber genie recovery expert these guys used their wild tech skills to help me trace and recover all that was stolen from me within a short period i hired them i was really patient and understanding with them because after a few sessions i began to have my doubts during these trial moments cyber genies team was very persuasive and encouraging i am glad my doubts and fears never won because the recovery was a success at last all hopes lost were restored stolen money recovered and created a lifetime relationship with cyber genies team   cybergenieatcyberservicesdotc0m  wha sapp 12525120391  telegram cybergeniehackpro
Jan 9 2024,positive,great storyline made me cry at the end i enjoyed it
Jan 9 2024,negative,didnt like the movie was in japanese and had subtitles i actually fell asleep but my grandson and his friend liked it and thats all that mattered since i took them to watch it as they were on winter break from school
Jan 9 2024,positive,godzilla minus one is perhaps the best godzilla movie that i have ever seen the monster parts are vicious
Jan 9 2024,positive,godzilla minus one is an unexpectedly amazing film with deep character and story development while you want to see godzilla decimate cities and wreak havoc those types of scenes are used sparingly in minus one however when godzilla makes appearances  it has maximum impact less is definitely more the human characters and stories are the heart of this film which truly make it stand out it is a story of survival rebuilding gaining hope and losing hope it is also a movie about ptsd relationships and camaraderie and altruism godzilla just happens to be the antagonist and an excellent one at that go see it even if youre not a monster moviegodzilla fan you will not be disappointed unless you have absolutely no empathy or feelings the acting character development and story are that damn good with a budget of 15 million this movie easily equals and easily surpasses many hollywood blockbusters with 200 million dollar budgets or more
Jan 8 2024,positive,absolutely spectacular seriously but i have to include a warning this is not classic godzilla hes scary as hell think twice before bringing your children to the theater to see this because more than a few parents had to escort their crying kids out of the showing i was at
Jan 8 2024,positive,shikishima a failed kamikaze pilot struggles to come to terms with his cowardice and building a life in bomb damaged tokyo   godzilla doesnt help    this is what ive wanted every time they announced a new godzilla film   and they always failed me   the series of silly heroic godzilla films of the 60s and 70s were entertaining as a kid but when i was older i realized what a quality film the original was    this film honors that initial portrayal and instead of giving us lackluster humans we dont care about such as in the recent us films we are given sincere portrayals representing citizens and soldiers to which we can relate   found family  survivors guilt   hope  redemption  these themes are explored in such a way we are made part of the characters journeys      highly recommended    there is a mid credits scene
Jan 8 2024,positive,overall best godzilla to date clever reboot of the original and best human acting of the franchise
Jan 8 2024,positive,brilliant in every aspect that godzilla is a true monster and you do now want to mess with it because it does not give a damn about humans at all the movie keeps its speed and tension from the very beginning to the very end worth every penny
Jan 8 2024,positive,the best godzilla movie ever made and one of the best movies ever made
Jan 8 2024,positive,it is the best movie i have seen ive seen it 17 times now and i never get tired of it in fact every time i see it i feel a new meaning the powerful vfx are worthy of an academy award it will always be a masterpiece among masterpieces and will continue to impress future generations
Jan 8 2024,positive,this film got me crying like a baby 100 the best film of all time  in my opinion makes other movie studios look bad with the 15 million dollar budget
Jan 8 2024,positive,quite honestly the most engaging film i saw from 2023 an extremely character driven movie with likeable and interesting characters whos motives made you feel the hate they had for godzilla this was a monster movie done and executed to perfection with a small budget it has been a phenomenal year for movies and this was the cherry on top i hope to see more quality films like this in the future
Jan 8 2024,positive,actually makes godzilla scary
Jan 8 2024,positive,the superb story and a film that makes godzilla scary as hell

Jan 8 2024,positive,this is a great movie overall and the best of all the godzilla movies including the hollywood movies great combination between a good human stories and the monster attacking love it
Jan 8 2024,positive,saw this opening night what can i say that everyone hast said already go watch this
Jan 8 2024,positive,i have not gone back to the theater to see a movie a second time since the dark knight returns  godzilla minus one is an incredible film on trauma life and humanity  a mustsee
Jan 8 2024,positive,best movie i have seen in years
Jan 8 2024,positive,best godzilla movie since the 70s  its a must see for godjira fans
Jan 8 2024,positive,a compelling human story that is also true to the original godzilla movies best movie ive seen in quite some time
Jan 8 2024,positive,best movie of the year best godzilla to date
Jan 8 2024,positive,awesome movie from start to finish
Jan 7 2024,positive,movie looks great especially considering the budget  fun film about humanity working together to overcome their past miatakes
Jan 7 2024,positive,not just another godzilla movie
Jan 7 2024,positive,true kino  it made me feel like i was having my first cinematic experience again  riddled with subtle references to previous films and godzilla media and incredible direction i have only minor quibbles with any of the editing decisions but those pale in comparison with the excellent story telling acting splendid toshiro mifune tribute from at least one of the actors and impeccable slapstick timing the new godzilla design is simply stunning  you can tell they based it off an actual bipedal dinosaur because of the way his head bobs when he walks the closest thing to a perfect movie i have watched in a very very long time
Jan 7 2024,positive,easily the best godzilla movie ever made the storyline was compelling and the character development was excellent the special effects were perfect this is a really great movie
Jan 7 2024,positive,fantastic ending no more monsters japan has had enough
Jan 7 2024,positive,great acting a story about humans and their relationships
Jan 7 2024,positive,great gojira movie couldve been more bloody and a little less cliché but nothing that disgrace the movie
Jan 7 2024,positive,pleasant surprise i couldnt be less interested in godzilla but i loved it great character story action sequences were refreshingly brief in a time where most action movies overdo it looking at you marvel i dont need to see monsters or superheroes crash through cgi buildings for 30 minutes per scene
Jan 7 2024,positive,great story  loved it
Jan 7 2024,positive,this is an up close and personal story of a war survivor whos ability to fight his demos is repeatedly wrecked by godzilla until the guy totally loses it  and its not your dads godzilla this one is meaner and more powerful than all others  well written well acted beautifully presented
Jan 7 2024,positive,a return to the beginning  a well crafted update of the original film leagues ahead of the drivel churned out by hollywood
Jan 7 2024,positive,one of the best movies ive ever seen 
Jan 7 2024,positive,a monster movie with fully developed characters a fresh and interesting plot and a kickass monster if only they were still making this kind of movie in hollywood i wouldnt have had to read english subtitles that said the film was so engrossing that i soon forgot that i was reading
Jan 7 2024,positive,great story  great character development  great visuals  it should win awards
Jan 7 2024,positive,great plot to accompany the normal destruction from godzilla
Jan 7 2024,positive,the story was very good very moving  never thought to understand what it was like in japan after ww2
Jan 7 2024,positive,great story and plot great characters and you feel a lot of affection for the characters for a low quality budget movie its a masterpiece
Jan 7 2024,positive,if you like epic kind of monster movies i totally recommend this one i think this one is so much better than hollywoodmade kitsch films
Jan 7 2024,positive,despite not being familiar enough with japanese it keeps you hooked to read the subtitles for the entire runtime which this is what id say is an average runtime but it uses its time incredibly well more than anything this truly puts the majority of at least the last decade of movies from hollywood to shame    every element about a movie that matters is most excellent it does an excellent job at especially highlighting the burdenshame and pain that shikishima carries the human cost of everything involved leading up to japans surrender in ww2 and to experience catastrophe from a new threat however on the opposite side of this rhetorical coin is godzilla the way i understood him their monster their villain was primarily two fold one where i can feel sympathy for him but one where i also dislike him for the destruction he does and his seeming lack of awareness or concern for the damage hes causing
Jan 7 2024,positive,honestly i came into this one not knowing what to expect never saw a godzilla film before this and i felt like this would be a jurassic world type film but with another monster man i was wrong this film had pretty much nothing that i could point out that was done poorly everything felt just right 1010
Jan 7 2024,positive,wow easily the best godzilla movie ever made it was like all of the godzillas combined also it was a good storyline even if you took godzilla out of the movie
Jan 7 2024,positive,absolutely awesome very well done
Jan 7 2024,negative,am i the only one who thought this movie fell flat as interesting as his background was the main protagonist was hard to root for plot was predictable wasnt very clever cut out all the scenes without godzilla and i wouldve left much happier sigh i really wanted to like this one
Jan 7 2024,positive,the story is superb and very engaging even if you have no interest in the movie monster part of it i enjoyed the acting and thought it was beautifully shot as well godzilla was pretty scary too but it was the relationships between the groups of guy friend and the ones with koichi and his found family that made it a great afternoon at the movies
Jan 7 2024,positive,great story awesome camera angles great looking old school godzilla see it before it leaves theaters as it is a definite must see in the theater
Jan 7 2024,positive,one of the best films ive seen
Jan 7 2024,positive,the movie was really entertaining and godzillaholy cow i love his atomic breath it really showed me that you can do different things with godzilla this is a must see movie
Jan 7 2024,positive,not only is godzilla minus one a spectacular monster movie but it also manages to cross genres and give us an excellent world war ii movie told from the perspective of characters grappling with the aftermath of wwii over the course of the story they struggle to find their place during the period of japanese reconstruction how can life ever return to some semblance of normal with cities in ruins families destroyed and a new threat already on the horizon the story is heartfelt and surprisingly moving by the end you care so much for the lives of the characters lending refreshing gravity to the threat of the monster this is my favorite movie of 2023 by a long shot highly recommend checking it out
Jan 7 2024,positive,best godzilla since the original
Jan 7 2024,positive,a return to the classic style of godzilla excellent movie
Jan 7 2024,positive,so much better than all the american versions
Jan 7 2024,positive,my favorite film of 2023 good plot good acting good themes
Jan 7 2024,positive,just one word  a m a z i n g   
Jan 6 2024,positive,i really like the movie love the godzilla great movie i recommend
Jan 6 2024,positive,good modern take on the cheesy old movies from japan full of emotion and drama only negatives were some of the plot holes
Jan 6 2024,positive,this is the best movie of the year
Jan 6 2024,positive,one of the best films ive ever seen in the cinema from the trailer you could see that the film would be good but it far exceeded expectations
Jan 6 2024,positive,surprisingly enjoyable   the subtitles did not bother me at all
Jan 6 2024,positive,i liked that at every part of the movie i was constantly entertained the climax ending was amazing as well
Jan 6 2024,positive,the movie was absolutely amazing everything about the movie was spot on a must see
Jan 6 2024,positive,this throwback to the origins of the gojira legend leaves every hollywood version in the radioactive dust  cloverfield is the only american monster movie that comes close in terms of emotional resonance but even that relied heavily on narrative gimmickry  what makes godzilla minus one stand out so much is good old fashioned storytelling while it takes its time establishing its characters and setting it never drags due to the standard of writing and acting this milieu of people eking out an existence in postwar tokyo is interesting enough without a monster attack so when the carnage does start we genuinely care about these characters  if only hollywood could put away their dei manuals and concentrate on good writing like this the cineplexes wouldnt be clogged with so many empty spectacles
Jan 6 2024,positive,exactly what i wanted going in i kept myself from watching any trailer or synopsis
Jan 6 2024,positive,a fantastic movie  youre cheering for godzilla and cheering for the better people as well   great story telling  the characters are relatable and you feel for them its nice to see godzilla back
Jan 6 2024,positive,as someone who despises the godzilla films of legendary from the past few years this was refreshing as heck the humans actually feel important and they make actually logical decisions on how to handle said kaiju and have proper character development the writing in monsterverse was abnormally stupid i must admit they had a kaijudestroying bomb but they preferred to abduct kong from his natural habitat and destroyed a whole city like what but its good to see that the humans here actually seem like theyre doing what they can as they learn about godzilla and the postwar storyline behind the movie was done very well the only downside to this movie would be that godzilla as a cgi monster had very blocky movements at points when the shots were afar and the water cgi was also a bit meh but to be fair its budget was 15m which is especially impressive since godzilla vs kong was literally 10x that much and it was pretty bad
Jan 6 2024,positive,godzilla minus one was such a wonderful surprise of a movie i went with my 13 year old twin boys and even they loved the emotional storyline and the suspense in addition to godzilla destroying things which is really what they came to see the subtitles did not get in the way of enjoying this movie you didnt even notice it because the acting story and action were just so captivating i also thought that the innovative and scientific way they came up with trying to defeat godzilla was so refreshing and a welcome intellectual departure from just using guns and bombs which is typically what you see with monster movies you will not be disappointed and the orchestral classical musical score was so outstanding its what made the suspenseful parts suspenseful and was the perfect complement to the magnitude of this movie the score was even something you would want to listen to on its own hands down the best movie ive seen in a long time and unquestionably the best movie of the year bravo godzilla minus one bravo
Jan 6 2024,positive,better than i was expecting this was a compelling story with characters i cared about godzilla 1 went well beyond the standard monster vs the good guys flick no bs western preaching just a good story
Jan 6 2024,positive,gets back to the simplicity of storytelling and less on special effects hollywood needs to take notes and apply this formula to american films
Jan 6 2024,positive,godzilla stayed true to the original version  one of the best godzillas ive ever seen
Jan 6 2024,positive,this was such a great movie id highly recommend this movie for everyone to watch its not just a monsteraction movie the story telling in this movie is so great
Jan 6 2024,positive,this is a really enjoyable movie as its well balanced there was just the right amount of everything
Jan 6 2024,positive,the movie was great it sets it up to bring godzilla back to his original roots and it had a perfect mix of characters and had a very interesting story to tell
Jan 6 2024,positive,i cannot say enough good things about this movie it is the best movie of 2023 handsdown
Jan 6 2024,negative,i dont understand why this moving is getting high ratings both wife and i hated it b moving at best lost of over acting and moving was not in english  bottom line not worth it
Jan 6 2024,positive,1 of the best movies ive seen in many moons
Jan 6 2024,positive,love absolutely loved it and i have never seen a godzilla movie before  clips and bits and pieces but never a full film i am gobsmacked that i loved it so much i would see it again loved the characters superb acting fantastic videography wow
Jan 6 2024,positive,who knew a monster movie can have so much heart i may or may not have cried at the end of the movie 10 out of 10 would recommend 
Jan 6 2024,positive,for the first time in my godzilla viewing history i was genuinely sucked in by the character arc of the humans and their many challenges in living while such an everpresent threat godzilla is looming over them i consider this the best godzilla movie of all time and a great movie outside of that franchise as well watch as soon as you can
Jan 6 2024,positive,it renewed my faith of going to the movies
Jan 6 2024,positive,this is by far the best godzilla movie ive ever seen its not just about the battle with godzilla there is a major subplot involving characters that you truly grow to care about its very well done all around
Jan 6 2024,positive,it was so good really fun movie we all loved it the characters storylines were heartfeltengaging while still getting plenty of godzilla definitely worth a watch and a rewatch
Jan 6 2024,positive,this film is just a masterpiece its like the creators of this film is proving you dont need 100s of millions of bucks to make a movie with this films budget and godzilla he was in the film enough and the human character were better in this film than what the monsterverse is bring out this has got to be the best godzilla film in history
Jan 6 2024,positive,my son  i loved the movie didnt mind the subtitles lots of scary suspense drama and action also liked the part of japans history of tragic loss and regret during wwii great special effects and godzilla at his scariest dark side japan is 1 again at making godzilla movies
Jan 6 2024,positive,almost perfect  beautiful story of redemption and perseverance
Jan 5 2024,positive,great character development subtitles are easy to read really enjoyed this take on godzilla
Jan 5 2024,positive,absolutely emotionally amazing a must watch for any kaiju fan and a great movie for anyone
Jan 5 2024,positive,thoroughly entertaining and thoughtful at the same time godzilla never looked better
Jan 5 2024,positive,the best godzilla movie to date before the movie came out my favorite godzilla movie was godzilla vs kong when the first teaser for minus one came out i was so excited to finally see a new godzilla movie also keep an eye out for godzilla x kong the new empire releasing this year
Jan 5 2024,positive,this was way better than i expected
Jan 5 2024,positive,after the 1954 film gojira and the 2016 film shin godzilla this film closes a trilogy of good godzilla films between very interesting characters and a new story this film throws real spears at very important issues for japan such as war honor death a gripping plot which will quickly make anyone fall in love with this film
Jan 5 2024,positive,unexpectedly great intense epic and refreshing a lot more genuineness to godzilla and focus was placed on human characters and very well done so a complete and strong recommendation for this fantastic film
Jan 5 2024,positive,this movie is a masterpiece of writing and storytelling the water looked a bit off but the rest was amazing the ways it implies its messages of war love the japaneses gov its very good the passing was very good could be a bit faster the ending kinda angered me a little bit but it was still good all in all 9510
Jan 5 2024,positive,cant stop thinking about the historical story and symbolism unexpectedly wonderful story
Jan 5 2024,positive,the best godzilla movie i have ever seen
Jan 5 2024,positive,if you liked jaws you will like this the pacing the development of the people echos jaws
Jan 5 2024,positive,not only does the movie tell a touching meaningful story about humanity sacrifice and will to live but it is also a wildly entertaining godzilla movie the monster is extremely menacing and terrifying which is surprising considering the really low budget the movie is a masterpiece and it should be watched by everyone interested in both blockbusters and more artistic cinema
Jan 5 2024,negative,bad acting  typical japonese exaggerated performance  not sure why it got over 90 rating  are all good movies gone that were into something mediocre like this 
Jan 5 2024,positive,great story movie flowed nicely throughout human story and monster story combined to perfection well done and refreshing from most of the garbage out there now
Jan 5 2024,positive,this is a owesome movie but the half of this onel is just boooored but they make up for it with the appearance of godzilla
Jan 5 2024,positive,it was fantastic even with the subtitles it had a great story line and also great scenes with godzilla
Jan 5 2024,positive,great story line and excellent film quality i advise everyone to see it
Jan 5 2024,positive,i love foreign films it was nice to see this one from japan it was way too loud
Jan 4 2024,positive,loved the old school feel and show how godzilla become strong each time it gets hurt
Jan 4 2024,positive,wow an absolute amazing film it has drama action suspense and everything you could ever want in a movie unlike other godzilla movies this one focuses more on the human characters rather than the monsters themselves
Jan 4 2024,positive,the best movie of 2023 a true example of what going to the movie theater is all about simply the best godzilla movie out there with much respect to the 1954 film this is the best godzilla and movie of 2023 you have to go to the movie theater to really enjoy it and the art of it a must see movie on everyones bucket list
Jan 4 2024,positive,fantastic movie my all time favorite godzilla movie now thats a scary monster
Jan 4 2024,positive,this version was much more centered around the human characters and human drama  the creature was a device to move those stories along rather than being the complete story itself  it also kept essential elements of the tradition including some of the dramabuilding music  extremely well done
Jan 4 2024,positive,i had never seen a godzilla movie before this was a fantastic time good action great effects good story characters you care about
Jan 4 2024,positive,one of the best godzilla films fantastic reiteration of the original definitely a must see i will admit the emotional responses are slightly exaggerated but fire fucking movie
Jan 4 2024,positive,way better than i was expecting it to be great emotion i was a bit disappointed with the very end though
Jan 4 2024,positive,must watch for all fans of godzilla
Jan 4 2024,positive,the monster was incredible for a guy in a rubber suite special effects were top drawer 
Jan 4 2024,positive,what an incredible film fantastic pacing never really slows down right from the opening you definitely dont have to be a monster moviegodzilla fan to enjoy this 
Jan 4 2024,positive,this movie is everything a godzilla movie should be about calamity disaster hopelessness loved every moment of this film and im definitely seeing it for a 2nd viewing with my dad who is a massive fan of the original 54 film
Jan 4 2024,positive,godzilla is of the japanese undoubtedly nobody like them to make movies about the famous feared and beloved monster an interesting story based on the human characters not the monster with a good development and technically magnificent not any signs of cgi a very natural aspect of the vfx also a very early showing of godzilla in the very first minutes of the film which i saw as a good thing
Jan 3 2024,positive,best movie of the year  yes a godzilla movie can be that good  the human story is so good i was in tears and the monster was better than it has ever been  there has never been a monster movie this good and the fact that it was better than any other movie this year is mind boggling  go see it on the big screen while you still can
Jan 3 2024,positive,the first godzilla movie from 1954 depicts a postwar japan devastated by war and nuclear bombs  godzilla minus one takes place mostly in the late 1940s japan and plays on the same theme in fact minus one borrows heavily from the early godzilla movies and its great    the protagonist kōichi shikishima played by ryunosuke kamiki is ridden with survivors guilt hes kind of mopey and somewhat dislikable it begs the question of whether we as an audience should appreciate his yearning for a heroic sacrifice on the other hand the movies heartwarming qualities comes from the supporting cast humanizing the victims of this new threat    beyond its visuals themes and great soundtrack godzilla minus one managed something amazing it rejects traditionalistic values and brilliantly exclude any involvement from the military or the government from the problem solving     most definitely one the best movie in the franchise if not of the whole genre
Jan 3 2024,positive,i did enjoy the movie even though it was in japanese  i did not like that i had to read to understand the movie
Jan 3 2024,positive,the movie was amazing to watch it always had me on edge i also prefer that it is in japanese with english subtitles
Jan 3 2024,positive,a must see movie for all ages both emotional and heart stopping great storyits just godzilla with his mayhem
Jan 3 2024,positive,this is an excellent movie it avoids all the cliché stuff that you see in hollywood productions of godzilla movies great development of characters and you never know the fate of certain characters the only minor gripe is the slow pacing in certain places overall a great change to how a godzilla movie was made compare to us ones
Jan 3 2024,positive,a fantastic drama with compelling character development and emotion with the godzilla action and spectacle being the cherry on top
Jan 3 2024,positive,a wellwritten powerfullyacted emotionallygripping historical drama that happens to have a nuclearpowered dinosaur in it
Jan 3 2024,positive,the action the story the setting the characters the emotion well rounded film that over performed any expectations i had going in this is the best godzilla film ive seen and ive seen many
Jan 3 2024,positive,this movie was fantastic the story was engaging and it took the viewer through a range of emotionsempathy fear honor love  it showed the power of ordinary citizens when they unite for a cause
Jan 3 2024,negative,this was arguably the most predictable movie ive ever seen halfway through the movie i could tell you exactly how it was going to end and knowing how it was going to end made the lead up to the final scene a complete slog they spent way too much time building up to a climax that everyone in the theater knew was coming its like the script was written by an ai who had spent the last 10 years learning all the action movie cliches i had really high hopes and walked out feeling like i had wasted two hours seeing a movie id already seen a hundred times before
Jan 3 2024,positive,as a fan of the monsterverse films this is everything that i have been missing and so much more going into it i knew the godzilla aspect of the film would be wonderful but the emotional depth and tone of the story made for such a captivating film my only problem with this sort of film is the redundant nature of making up a new way to kill godzilla and godzilla being able to withstand it with that being said it was better that the film was mainly human character development led the interconnectivity between the visuals and the story made for a smooth 2 hour runtime that keeps you entertained the whole time moreover the fact that the film was created with just 15 million is absolutely insane and you could tell so much effortwork was put into the final product to create an enjoyable fan experience basically it was a lot more meaningfulheavy in terms of subject matter than i was expecting it to be and im ashamed i waited so long to see it
Jan 3 2024,positive,excellent movie  story and characters were all done perfectly  godzillas effects were amazing we can only hope more godzilla movies will continue with such attention to the details that result in such excellent storytelling
Jan 3 2024,positive,great attention to detail and honored the original
Jan 3 2024,positive,best movie of 2023 a classic
Jan 3 2024,negative,i was asked to join friends so i bought 2 tickets and took my son with me i was not aware that the entire movie was in japanese with english subtitles my son does not read fast enough to keep up with the subtitles and i could not read them to him out of respect for the other movie goers around us this made it less enjoyable for both of us  the movie itself was ok but not great
Jan 3 2024,positive,its godzilla whats not to like about it characters the sameoriginal ok a little updated with the nuclear blasts beast and the storyline was great the original score from the old movies was nice to hear reminded me of watching them with my family when i was growing up
Jan 3 2024,positive,emotional rollercoaster  human survival against surmountable odds realistic view on what ptsd can do to a person ive watched godzilla movies since the original with burr this one by far is the most terrifying the casting fit like a puzzle must see
Jan 3 2024,positive,best movie of 2023   see it on the big screen when you can
Jan 3 2024,positive,amazing human characters and story versus a truly terrifying godzilla  captures everything that made the very first godzilla a huge hit while making you care about the plot and drama encircling the monster

Jan 3 2024,positive,simply put the best one yet
Jan 3 2024,positive,this is the first time i can remember caring about the humans in a godzilla movie even more than godzilla himself the movie is in japanese with english subtitles which i prefer over a quick english dubbing that would take me out of the movie i loved the movie watching it and i love it more the longer i think on itfor a film made with about 15 million alone its made an impact on me i think will stick much more than the usual blockbusters boasting a massive pricetag
Jan 3 2024,positive,best movie ive seen in years 
Jan 3 2024,positive,this was a good movie
Jan 3 2024,positive,the best godzilla ever done

Jan 2 2024,positive,lots of thrills and a beautiful ending
Jan 2 2024,positive,two words absolutely astounding this movie in my very honest opinion is hands down the best godzilla movie ive ever seen my brother and i grew up watching godzilla back in the early 90s we decided to go see this one for our birthday saturday and we were blown away godzilla was honestly terrifying in such a believable way and his gamma ray it made the atom bomb look like a tiny splash in a lake  but really the best thing about this movie was the human aspect of it i cant remember the last time i cried watching a movie since the green mile i sat through the whole ending credits to give respect to every single person who had a hand to play in this masterpiece id give it a 1010 if i could if youve not seen this movie go now i cant wait till this comes out on dvd
Jan 2 2024,positive,felt like a fresh breath of air as the film makers took this subject as a serious disaster movie  though slow as times i appreciated the human story in this one  yes godzilla at one point seem to just float upright in the ocean but thems the breaks
Jan 2 2024,positive,an absolute triumph of movie making  this is so much more than a godzilla film  its hard to believe the human story could overshadow the monster but it does  btw its clear that godzilla does not skip leg day but he does skip arm day 
Jan 2 2024,positive,a fabulous godzilla movie  grounded characters that you care about tremendous godzilla action with a portrayal of g that hews true to godzilla as nearly unstoppable force of nature  tremendous use of the classic godzilla musical scores and a wonderful look at post war japan  this is monster movie and human movie and is just an outstanding job from toho
Jan 2 2024,positive,such a great movie sent chills down my spine and brought tears to my eyes
Jan 2 2024,positive,i have watched this movie twice and it was so amazing as a huge godzilla fan this is one of my favourite movies ever made considering the budget is only 15 million the visual effects was incredible easily best movie of 2023
Jan 2 2024,positive,awesome special effects touching story  smart script easily one of the best movie in last decades
Jan 2 2024,positive,the best godzilla movie ever made excellent japanese production
Jan 2 2024,positive,i cant wait to watch this movie again action drama raw emotions and a little comic relief now thats a movie hollywood needs to take notes a lot of them   and the ending was perfect they left it open for a sequel
Jan 2 2024,positive,it was good but attended because of my grandsons ages 5 and 7 love godzilla movies  the closed captions and japanese language was a big negative  would have been nice to add english language
Jan 2 2024,positive,its the best movie that ive seen in cinema 2023 absolutely gonna buy this on 4k bluray when it gets out an absolute masterpiece
Jan 2 2024,positive,even with subtitles this is one of the best godzilla movies ive ever seen it was absolutely great a must see excellent story and cinematography its simply what you go to movies for
Jan 2 2024,positive,this is not a godzilla film in the way i think most people will assume it to be it is an examination of grief sacrifice and perseverance in the years immediately following the devastation experienced in post wwii japan and godzilla     thats absolutely a reductionist view of the titular monster he is the physical representation of the evil of man that would bring about such devastation against whom the humans must defeat for hope not only in survival but in a better world to possibly be restored     ok that might be too lofty a description also but frankly its hard to find the words to accurately describe this film and all that it achieved i am not a godzilla fan ive seen the newer ones and theyre ok the idea of a giant ramping monster especially once it starts fighting other rampaging monsters always sounded silly to me i understand its origins were born in making sense of the horrors of the atomic bomb and fears for humanity after its creation but mostly its appeal has been extremely limited for me especially after 1998 im sorry but ew     but     godzilla minus one is just a good fing film i cannot say enough good things about it it is 100000 worth paying to see in the theater and theres just not a lot of movies out these days that you can really say that for it truly deserves more than just an oscar for best vfx which it has been nominated for writing directing cinematographyart direction best actor and yes best film     go see it in theaters now while you can
Jan 2 2024,positive,awesome best godzilla flick ever
Jan 2 2024,positive,best movie of 2023 great story loved the characters godzilla was big and terrifying effects were spot on and the music soars it was an emotional sweep from drama to spectacle the biggest surprise of the year and i say see it in the theater on the big screen with some popcorn and soda
Jan 2 2024,positive,best movie ive seen in years the human story and monster cgi action the best cgi ive seen in years were balanced perfectly ive enjoyed the ride at most kaiju movies but never have i been drawn into the human story in one before every human moment in the drama was earned not a single movie this year can touch this masterpiece of action drama pathos and story
Jan 2 2024,positive,this will definitely serve as a blueprint for future monster films
Jan 2 2024,positive,great godzilla movie was impressed with story and the effects take note hollywood

Jan 2 2024,positive,this is the best movie i have seen in the longest time and i doubt ill see anything as good for the rest of my life the joy i felt seeing an actual japanese godzilla in the theater and then for that movie to be true to fashion while also being one of the very best godzilla movies i have ever seen it was absolutely incredible thats how you make a godzillia movie not the garbage that america has been trying to shovel feed us     1010 hands down the best film since the turn of the century
Jan 2 2024,positive,as a native japanese this movie is awesome and this is my first godzilla movie  i watched this movie at a movie theater and i was so happy to see that audience in the theater clapped loudly at the end of the movie  it shows the historical context very well such as the chaos struggles and emotional wounds volatility and slow recovery after ww2 i was also amazed that the movie shows detailed historical object such as japanese fighter plane zero and shinden and japanese cruiser takao  i am very glad that they choose the era that original godzilla was born rather than choosing modern world my image to godzilla movie in the past was just panic and fighting with godzilla wo message or story behind  but this movie gave us the emotional message and story of peoples pain and strength i highly recommend this movie to both who watched and never watched previous godzilla movie
Jan 2 2024,positive,in one word perfection
Jan 2 2024,positive,like maverick but with english subtitles nice balance of action and suspense building like the original godzilla movies loved it

Jan 2 2024,positive,great story great effects great emotion great acting great take on history entertaining and while familar we all know the monster attacks etc story much more emotionally connecting that movies in this genra    i was puzzled by the title but in movie realized that it is simply like saying in a game  john minus one to indicate he lost the match

Jan 2 2024,positive,the movie is exciting it is enjoyed more if you watch it in a 4dx room since all the scenes feel as if you were inside the moviethere is constant action and that is a lot to be grateful for the budget was low but the film looked incredible without a doubt this is a love letter for godzilla fans 1010 masterpiece
Jan 2 2024,positive,absolutely loved the movie the main characters arch was so good and the movie was so much more deeper than i expected i came to watch it with my little brother and left questioning the value of life
Jan 2 2024,negative,did anyone actually watch this film
Jan 2 2024,positive,very good movie highly recommend watching it is very epic the acting was much better than the wb and legendary versions godzilla was much angrier and the postworld war 2 setting was the perfect setting
Jan 2 2024,positive,great story telling even with the subtitles cool ending too 
Jan 1 2024,positive,great movie not overdone if youre a fan of old school godzilla movies this hit all the touchstones plus a great plot
Jan 1 2024,positive,outstanding movie hollywood could learn from this movie about writing great characters and great action for less than the budget of one episode of she hulk hope they understand this
Jan 1 2024,positive,good film it reminded us of the old godzilla movies
Jan 1 2024,positive,great characters and story amazing visuals really got a feel for what being under attack by godzilla might be like but he was just a vehicle to tell a great and hopeful message
Jan 1 2024,positive,totally awesome not  what i expected even my wife loved it  it had everything you expect in a movie outstanding
Jan 1 2024,positive,amazing in my opinion the best one
Jan 1 2024,positive,my favorite movie of 2023 such great characterizations i was 100 invested in the people in this godzilla movie which made the monster that much more of a threat and the noncgi effects were fantastic great film
Jan 1 2024,positive,if deer hunter was a story of post vietnam war vets struggling with their demons then this is a story of post ww2 japanese vets struggling with their monsters   a great blend of a story and a monster movie
Jan 1 2024,positive,i took my father and grandfather because they are big fans i havent watched many of the godzilla movies so i did not expect to be invested in it at all not only was i invested but was crying by the end of the movie it was absolutely amazing
Jan 1 2024,positive,a great film especially with the budget used to make this movie some of the special effects seemed very low quality but i still really enjoyed it
Jan 1 2024,positive,this movie was fantastic great plot great godzilla design and really returns to the franchises dark origin this was probably the best godzilla movie to date and compared to the hollywood movies this one blew them out of the water even my mom loved it and she is not very into movies
Jan 1 2024,positive,this is absolutely one of the best godzilla movies ever made there was a real depth to the characters that made every interaction with big g a moment where you truly fretted for them godzilla was menacing in a way that we havent felt in a long time
Jan 1 2024,positive,best godzilla movie i ever seen taking it back to its roots with amazing human story with actual meaning and symbolism for every part of the movie great character arcs good visuals and compelling story telling    must watch

Jan 1 2024,positive,it was great the action and everything and a little bit of horror was excellent

Jan 1 2024,positive,i now have a new favorite godzilla movie
Jan 1 2024,positive,this film maintains the original essence of godzilla it is incredible in all aspects without a doubt a movie you cant miss
Jan 1 2024,negative,there was never a reason why godzilla shows up i had a big problem with that also the movie glorifies ww2 japanese fighters who were allied with hitler if thats not a big red flag idk what is
Jan 1 2024,negative,this was a bad movie first of all it glorifies world war 2 japanese soldiers may i ask would you watch a movie glorifying nazi soldiers fighting a monster war crimes were committed by japan and is now internationally recognized so to have a movie glorifying the soldiers is appalling secondly the movie was pointless it did not talk about godzilla lore and with all the drama they didnt even kill godzilla granted we know that godzilla is practically impossible to kill but the whole motif of the film is awkward and offensive a kamikaze soldier realizing he wanted to live okay i see the heros journey but the movies acting was so bad that you cant focus on trying to enjoy the story
Jan 1 2024,positive,favorite movie this year
Jan 1 2024,positive,oh come on screenwriters who know how to simultaneously develop characters and tell a story a director who knows how to direct a cast actors who get a script and can stay on tone depending on the scene    yes please    i canno recommend this highly enough enjoyed it as much as jaws  and that is saying something 
Jan 1 2024,negative,truly one of the worst storylines and acting ive ever seen never seen a godzilla movie so oerhaps fans are used to this senseless type of film
Jan 1 2024,positive,this is the best godzilla film of all time
Jan 1 2024,positive,ive been a godzilla fan since i was a kid 51 now and have seen pretty much everything with big g in it plus comicsanimationbooks etc this ranks up there with the very best thats been offered with the original gojira being the benchmark i do love godzilla returns1984 godzilla vs biollante and enjoyed shin godzilla also but this is very very well done and deserves all the praise it has received bravo toho bravo
Jan 1 2024,positive,this a was a great movie personally i didnt mind reading the captions but some people might i loved how it all went the a story line 1010 movie i would definitely recommend this movie 
Jan 1 2024,positive,we enjoyed godzilla we saw the film on a regular screen because we waited too long for the fancy ones but it didnt affect the movie the subtitles were easy to read for old people like us we didnt cry at any point others have said that they did the film was interesting exciting and moving the special effects especially godzilla were fascinating how did they get that little girl to cry on cue watching how the filmmakers portrayed japan after wwii the rebuilding of their country their lives and how the people worked together to fight the monster was an insight into the culture of postwar japan that weve not had  were glad that japan shared the movie godzilla minus one with us
Jan 1 2024,positive,a breath of fresh air not just for godzilla fans come watch and understand why critics and audiences are raving mad about the success and epitome of the movie monster icon that is godzilla minusone
Jan 1 2024,positive,toho got their king back after 7 years and they put it to good use  godzilla minus one is a masterpiece to say the least 1010
Jan 1 2024,positive,good movie only wish it was in english
Jan 1 2024,positive,this was a good story but i think it was overhyped it was definitely a whole lot better than the american godzilla films but that is because those films were soulless paintbynumbers movies this film definitely had more to say for a monster flick but the ending was lacking something
Jan 1 2024,positive,this movie was a masterpiece i know that term is just thrown around but i mean this in all its meaning i cannot recommend this movie enough
Jan 1 2024,positive,best godzilla movie of all time including the japanese original japan reckons with the postwar kamikaze trauma godzilla is a monster godzilla is a metaphor but the best thing about this monster movie is the people which has never been done
Dec 31 2023,positive,so this is a monster movie where the messaging goes far beyond the monster maybe we need to wake up and pay attention to it while we have 2 wars raging in the world nothing short of a triumph
Dec 31 2023,positive,amazing movie havent enjoyed a movie like that in a long time cant stop thinking about it
Dec 31 2023,positive,best movie ever  best visual direction and acting  great concept for a film11
Dec 31 2023,positive,this movie accomplishes something no other godzilla film has in my opinion it made me genuinely care about the human cast and their issues unlike previous films where you might root for godzilla this one instills a sense of dread when he arrives returning to the roots of what he was meant to embody godzilla becomes the embodiment of the consequences for mans actions and reckless disregard for the planet an absolute unstoppable wrecking ball its spectacular to witness after watching it twice i can confidently say this is in my opinion the best godzilla film ever made and i have zero complaints
Dec 31 2023,positive,awesome film one of the best of 2023
Dec 31 2023,positive,the film shows us that even somebody with many defects and errors from protagonist and societys perspective  as would a japanese deserter be has the right to live for that is the movie about about life the bonds that we make and move people to carry on to forgive themselves even when we face situations bigger than ourselves  godzilla minus one is a balance between action emotion good story and character development touching many subjects that a human being could face and that goes beyond our beloved kaiju this one attaining a symbolic significance of a societys unrest situations being these real attacks or psychological definitely a film the very same hollywood should envy
Dec 31 2023,positive,a really a good hamburger if you are in the mood

Dec 31 2023,positive,best godzilla movie in decades for the first time in a very long time you actually care about the human characters this is the film that i will show everyone to get them into godzilla movies
Dec 31 2023,negative,great movie  if youre a fiveyearold the dialogue was stiff and on the nose all exposition no subtext every scene was predictable and overly dramatic the acting was onedimensional and the monster fully exposed in the first few minutes so all possibility of suspense was removed absolutely awful avoid

Dec 31 2023,positive,incredibly well made movie loyal to its subject matter with an intimacy to detail on an epic scale    but its much more than just an action film  the heart the drama the emotional pull and authenticity of skilled actors and a story line you care about make it easily one of the best movies of the year  must see on the big screen

Dec 31 2023,positive,the best movie of godzilla in the history
Dec 31 2023,positive,a spit in the eye of hollywood
Dec 31 2023,negative,sorry but this movie was bad  nearly every scene was overlydramatic the plot beyond predictable the acting was meh and quite emotionless  which i partially blame on poor translation  even the star monster was disappointingly fake looking  reminding one of a transformertype toy

Dec 30 2023,positive,the story and acting were amazing even with reading subtitles and not understanding the actors actual speech you can feel the emotion and sincerity in their voices the visuals and effects are excellent especially for a such a relatively small budget this godzilla is more genuine and has more soul than the recent american godzilla movies which were fine but lacked the character that japanese godzilla movies possess

Dec 29 2023,positive,i have not seen a better storyline in recent years  extremely well written and directed  this was more of an epic feel than a typical monsteraction movie  it wasnt quite what i was expecting  due to its length and the amount of drama i dont think its one that i will want to watch as often as other godzilla movies but the postwwii tiein is compelling and adds so much to the depth of the story

Dec 29 2023,positive,the only reason i didnt give it all five stars is because it wasnt dubbed in english
Dec 29 2023,positive,this movie understands perfectly how a disastermonster film should be and yes godzilla is important but if you dont have a good human story where you can connect then it doesnt gonna work here we worried about the characters we can relate with them we wanted that they win oh and by the way godzilla not a nice guy just saying godzilla is going to protect us the same way we protect the ants

Dec 28 2023,positive,godzilla minus one tells an intriguing and at times heart wrenching human story set to the backdrop of early post world war ii the monster itself delivers all the punch you would hope for as a modern version of the classic godzilla we know and love every scene is a work of art a bit of humor is interspersed to keep the mood from trending to dark i usually hate cgi but found the effects in this movie felt more practical than computer generated this wild ride is what going to the movies is all about
Dec 28 2023,positive,i havent been to the cinema since 2018 and there hasnt been a single film ive been enticed to see in all that time hollywood is and has been dead to me    but then godzilla rumbles into town and shows me that cinema isnt dead  its just moved hq  this movie was spectacular  and im not talking just about visual effects which are pretty much a given in this day in age the story is tight compelling  wastes no time and yet breathes with incredible ease letting you get to know the characters without any hamfisted plot dumps its not possible to watch this movie without tearing up even just a little you will get a lump in your throat and you will be grateful for it    im not particularly into godzilla or monster flicks in general  but i have to say i am grateful to some friends who convinced me to go and see this film i had seen reviews of it saying it was brilliant so i was sure it would be an enjoyable film  but seeing is believing this film absolutely deserves a 100 rating  and its very heartening to see it get 98 from both the professional cretins critics and audience alike    so bravo to toho studios  you guys knocked it out of the park
Dec 28 2023,positive,i have never had such a powerful experience in a theater immediately engaging and every moment is potent until the last credit leaves the screen did not know me and my wife would be crying tears throughout for a godzilla movie this is maybe the most important movie to come out in my lifetime as a descendant of japanese people who endured wwii it was a deeply moving and overwhelmingly spiritual experience i will never be the same    please go and see this movie in theaters if you can

Dec 28 2023,positive,best movie ive seen this year
Dec 28 2023,positive,really enjoyed it the film takes its time developing the characters and godzillas mystic isnt killed with cheap attempts to humanize it or by overusing it in scenes they also limit the amounts of time they show its full length and size which is how youre supposed to treat a giant monster in a giant monster movie score was amazing and no wasted scenes by far my favorite film of the year and i appreciate both bomb scenes in this one over oppenheimer which was beautiful but slightly underwhelming especially after the first time you watch it anyways go check it out folks
Dec 28 2023,positive,left me a bit more optimistic about the monster movie genre returning to its roots
Dec 28 2023,positive,an emotional human story with devastating destruction and tense godzilla fights

Dec 27 2023,positive,the movie that i saw in the theaters was absolutely crazy i absolutely love it but the only thing that holds this one back just one spot is that critics are being rude about this movie stop being so crazy for once gosh but its their opinion on it so i do mind it but im not going up against them
Dec 27 2023,positive,very good action movie
Dec 27 2023,positive,stunningly superb  a surprisingly moving human story of duty shame redemption and tenderness all embedded in a monster movie of all things  highly recommended
Dec 27 2023,positive,when i was a kid my parents had a vhs of godzillas son that introduced me to the godzilla universe i watched that movie a hundred times going in fairly blind to minus 1 my expectations were tempered as recent hollywood versions have been a bit too childlike for me i had enough of goofy godzilla this film is a work of art with real characters to root for and a monster thats actually terrifying i hadnt experienced this much fun in a cinema in a while you can sense the filmmakers were so committed and inspired my love and nostalgia of godzilla is alive and well
Dec 27 2023,positive,so good i loved absolutely everything about this film i grew up amidst the monster craze of the 1970s and godzilla was my first favorite he looks and sounds great in this film the human cast is great as well and the story is deep and heartfelt awesome
Dec 27 2023,positive,loved everything except the main character
Dec 27 2023,positive,easily the best godzilla film ive ever seen i cried like multiple times godzilla was legit terrifying    i actually cared about all of the human characters something that hasnt happened since the first 15 minutes of gareth edwards godzilla    after this i think americans should just leave godzilla alone let japanese creative teams handle it the american versions are nowhere near this quality
Dec 27 2023,positive,this was the perfect godzilla movie for the modern age so glad i went to see it
Dec 27 2023,positive,honestly best movie that toho has released in my opinion it makes the human characters actually interesting and entertaining godzilla is terrifying and everything he does is horrifying and the fact that hes a reflection of the atomic bomb that destroyed japan is amazing the cgi and everything graphical is great and makes godzilla look real honesty there is probally more to say but thats all i can give this movie credit
Dec 27 2023,positive,its a perfect godzilla movie for the new age the blend of practical effects and special effects was seamlessly done and visually excels above most hollywood productions the human story was thrilling and every time godzilla was on screen it invoked the terror youd expect
Dec 27 2023,positive,eu amei o filme definitivamente o melhor com trilhas clássicas não tenho nem palavras para descrever ele    i loved the film definitely the best with classic soundtracks i dont even have words to describe it
Dec 27 2023,positive,to me this movie is an outstanding tribute to the classic godzilla movies  there were so many moments that caused a flashback to the originals brought back to life in such a spectacular way  you dont want to miss godzilla minus one  one of the best if not the best movie of the year  really hoping they do more films like this adding mothra king ghidorah rodan ebirah king caesar etc
Dec 27 2023,positive,wow it was amazing never thought id cry watching a godzilla film its that good and probably one of 2023s best movies do yourself a favor and go watch it before it leaves the theaters
Dec 27 2023,positive,as a godzilla fan this movie is everything i wanted great action and interesting human characters this movie awe you with the terrifying sequences of godzilla and brings you to tears with main characters a perfect balance
Dec 27 2023,positive,one of the best depictions of godzilla the movie portrays the struggle of the common folk against insurmountable odds its mindboggling how the movie managed to accomplish so much in a single movie compared to a cinematic universe that fails to execute a single objective minus one deserves your attention for it is an triumph
Dec 27 2023,positive,this movie is never the less a masterpiece full of drama and a must watch
Dec 27 2023,positive,loved it the sub titles were not an issue
Dec 27 2023,positive,compelling plot good acting great visual effects
Dec 27 2023,positive,this is the first kaiju movie ive seen where the human characters are interesting enough to not feel just like something we have to get through to watch more kaiju action  both the human parts and kaiju action are great
Dec 27 2023,positive,very well done subtitles were easy to fllow
Dec 27 2023,positive,utterly phenomenal a powerhouse of a film that must be seen the story acting and fx are incredible godzilla rampages on a scale never before seen the best godzilla film of all time and the best film of 2023 see it on the biggest screen with best audio system in your town because anything less is unworthy of such a great film
Dec 27 2023,positive,the human element is what makes this movie great the godzilla character lacks development though i hope godzilla will have a chance to show its feelings in the next movie

Dec 27 2023,positive,incredible excellent story superior acting and a perfect depiction of godzilla oscarworthy
Dec 27 2023,positive,easily one of the best movies ive seen the call backs to the original and the heartfelt character moments really help elevate this film not many films can bring human characters in without taking away from the monster but this succeeded the film does get heavy thanks to the themes of ptsd and grief but its worth it i was crying by the end and left incredibly happy i saw this in theaters
Dec 27 2023,positive,i always judge based off a movie being worthwhile to rewatch and this absolutely fits that a great movie with a godzilla that has a captivating interpretation acting is great writing is great and pacing was strong hm spoiler alert and i wont lie their solution was very clever and i was amazed at their idea of trying to kill godzilla
Dec 26 2023,negative,took my boys to go see the movie 78 years old but was unaware that it was no in english they didnt last more than 15 minutes money wasted

Dec 26 2023,positive,been watching godzilla movies for 50 years this is a really good godzilla movie and a good movie in general the action has tension that builds and gives the scenes more weight saw it almost 4 weeks after it came out and the theater was packed
Dec 26 2023,positive,it had good characters and a great story
Dec 26 2023,positive,japanese with english subtitles we really enjoyed this take on godzilla great plot characters setting and ending
Dec 26 2023,positive,slow pace  climax was good  godzilla has mo character reminded me of giant robot japanese animated cartoon from 1980s
Dec 26 2023,positive,this is an excellent movie that gives you a glimpse into the emotional japan has felt through all of the destruction through the years you feel this movie through what will be several very iconic scenes this film also manages to keep you invested in the human characters as opposed to having us feverishly waiting for godzilla with tunnel vision    this will go down as the best godzilla film ever produced toho did an incredible job
Dec 26 2023,negative,this is a  slow overcooked movie  too much dialogue with little meaning i kept waiting for the movie to get better but it never did the salute to godzilla when he died was ridiculous you dont salute a beast that just destroyed your home and killed your friends and family  im surprised at the good reviews this movie sucks
Dec 26 2023,positive,excellent movie i recommend it very exciting
Dec 26 2023,positive,entertaining throughout with compelling human interactions and crazy monster destruction worth the watch even if youre hesitant about having to read subtitles

Dec 26 2023,positive,all around best movie this year for me
Dec 26 2023,negative,its ok but its slightly over hyped  its a godzilla movie but it doesnt have enough screen time the drama is the main part of the movie and when it does its underwhelming
Dec 26 2023,positive,i thought it had a very strong story and the characters really meant something
Dec 26 2023,positive,this godzilla film was something as fresh as shin godzilla with the realism and real life situations that would happen if godzilla was actually in this world great characters in this film that actually made me care great soundtrack and a great godzilla overall a good film that i recommend to anyone who is into godzilla or film in general
Dec 26 2023,positive,kinda old school feel i e very japanese monster was outstanding and story was sustainable forgot i was even reading the subtitles
Dec 26 2023,positive,the perfect movie for any who is a big fan of kaiju monsters or godzilla this movie actually makes you care for the characters and has its emotional moments and this is right of the bat a huge difference from the americanized godzilla so i really recommend you go to the theaters to watch this outstanding movie  support the director
Dec 26 2023,positive,godzilla in japan is essentially half god and half monster there is no reason for godzilla to appear just as there is no reason for a hurricane or a huge earthquake to occur the horror of this walking nuclear disaster is well expressed the battleships and the fighters are those that actually existed in the past i was surprised to see the heavy cruiser takao the lucky ship yukikaze and the mythical fighter shinden i would like to express my respect to the director and toho staff
Dec 26 2023,positive,must watch  i did not expect it to be so good 
Dec 26 2023,positive,stayed true to the 1950s version special effects were fantastic
Dec 26 2023,negative,horrible horrible horrible  i practically laughed through the entire movie  the acting is terrible where did they find these people  the entire premise was so ridiculous and adding a love story to the plot so that it would round out the movie fell like a thud  i love godzilla and king kong movies and could not wait to see this movie i went with my 2 sons and 2 nephews and we were all disappointed  it was almost a comedy  save your money and watch it on tv
Dec 26 2023,positive,it was a near flawless cinematic masterpiece i cant say anything negative about this film
Dec 26 2023,positive,one of the best movies of the year and one of the best kaiju movies ever made this is definitely one of the best godzilla movies

Dec 25 2023,positive,very great movie i can see why it has had such a positive reception the human story was very well done with solid acting from the cast each character is endearing and you really do root for them as for godzilla very solid design mixing traditional and newer aspects and it was definitely great to see some city destruction as well as something different like the water chase scene great movie for new and old fans
Dec 25 2023,positive,one of thr best movie of the year    glad that i got to see this one in imax and i wasnt expecting this movie to be so emotional with a lot of heart    in my opinion this is the first time where you actually fear godzilla and see his true side of destruction    awesome movie in every way
Dec 25 2023,positive,pretty embarrassing for hollywood
Dec 25 2023,positive,so worth itthe  story even though it was a completely different languagenever a dull moment
Dec 25 2023,positive,insanely good human characters are fleshed out and have you fearing for their safety throughout the whole movie godzilla and his theme are perfect
Dec 25 2023,positive,my third time best godzilla movie ever and i have seen every single one
Dec 25 2023,positive,while everyone were talking  about this movie id enjoy gozs plot and details of screen play  nicely done
Dec 25 2023,positive,i was genuinely having a hard time believing the good reviews this movie was getting and keep in mind this is coming from a hardcore godzilla fan so i was hearing a lot about this movie ever since it released and i finally came to watch it tonight and i have to admit i was worried it was going to be a disappointment however now having sat through the whole film i can safely say it was quite the opposite of that from beginning to end i was hooked thats something i never get from one of these movies like i mentioned before im a fan of these monster flicks but ive never given a monster movie a good rating only because im biased towards it this changed everything  i dont even know where to start the beginning sequence the ending sequence the family dynamic the score the vfx the main character and of course godzilla himself i actually care about the characters here and it was heartwarming seeing this disjointed family come together some might find this all a bit slow but personally i was invested i was never left wondering when the next godzilla scene will take place and of course we have to talk about that godzilla in this movie is just wow he was not there to play games he was not there to save the world against some worldending threat he was just a monster there to cause destruction and make the characters we know suffer legitimately this was the only time i remember wanting the humans to win and not the big old kaiju there might be mixed feelings on his screen time though some say hes got plenty to offer while others say hes in it too little my take is that if you take the term screentime literally then yes that lacks a bit here but the thing is he always feels like a threat you can feel his presence hes just lurking in the ocean waiting for the next time to strike and when he does come on screen my god he is terrifying and you will not be disappointed even if its a brief scene  many of us can agree he is more of a side character which i can imagine a few people getting upset about but what about the center of the story the main character shikishima is a failed kamikaze pilot he deals with survivors guilt and has trouble coming to the realization hes even alive hes convinced he died back in the war and his newfound life was just his last dream im not going to spoil anything but his character felt very complete and well written his character development was straight up beautiful the other stars of the show are a little girl her adoptive mother and a minesweeper crew they all have their good moments and have a lot of heart and personality to them   this movie also has a very good score it has hope it has fear its haunting its grandiose and of course classical the original godzilla theme is of course used in the film it is remastered but it still keeps the feel and terror of the 1954 suite  this movie cost less than 15 million dollars look what they did with that money the average monsterverse movie costs around 200 million dollars look what they did with that money the fact that the cgi cost just a mere fraction of a hollywood movie and looks just as good if not better than one is mindblowing there are just shots where you are staring at godzilla and his imposing figure it really is mesmerizing this should be the standard for modern movies  so in my conclusion this is my personal favorite godzilla movie by far its a beautiful story that you will get lost in i can only really see one small flaw with it and thats how it is a bit overacted in some parts but the more i think about this movie the more i appreciate it its almost perfect i came out of the theater only a couple of hours ago and i already feel like seeing it again i can see myself rewatching this over and over again for years to come and this review is not biased at all i am giving my true and honest opinion you will probably have a good time watching this movie even if you are not into kaiju movies if you are into the goofy more dumb fun monster flicks i cant guarantee youll like this film as much as others and i have if you like more grounded serious but still lighthearted movies i highly recommend it go see it before it leaves theaters im honestly very happy i got to see it on the big screen because it truly was a big experience im so happy about this films success and i can only imagine how embarrassed hollywood is right now they really need to wake up
Dec 25 2023,positive,this is definitive godzilla at its best absolutely stunning incarnation
Dec 25 2023,positive,even better than the original a real story with good character development we really enjoyed it

Dec 25 2023,positive,great movie loved the character development  wonderful story
Dec 25 2023,positive,plus 10 wow
Dec 24 2023,positive,the movie is not perfect visual effects could be better but in everything else the movie is simply amazing
Dec 24 2023,positive,totally awesome film from the beginning to the very end the character development storyline and godzilla meshed perfectly together
Dec 24 2023,positive,superb film very hear felt tense and emotion post world war 2 drama with real characters and great character development as well as a great monster movie impressive with the budget it had need to be seen to believe it

Dec 24 2023,positive,loved this movie a perfect tribute and celebration of the franchise 70year history a very serious treatment with excellent casting direction and production these are real characters with an emotional story to tell everyone involved in this project contributed masterfully the original score is perfectly performed and aligned the subtitling was also executed tremendously well not a distraction of your attention  you stay immersed in the action and drama highly recommend for every gojira fan and absolutely anyone who has ever wondered what the big deal is this is not camp cheese or silliness  its an excellent homage to the franchise roots and reintroduction for current and future generations thank you toho and everyone involved
Dec 24 2023,positive,reminds me of the original godzilla movie starring raymond bur excellently done 
Dec 24 2023,positive,they really stuck to the classic meaning of godzilla and they story just everything was nothing short of perfection
Dec 24 2023,positive,masterpiece i am 14 rn and i watched godzilla since when i was 4 it was absolutely beautiful movie perfect perfect for godzilla fans and non godzilla fans
Dec 24 2023,positive,not only best godzilla movie ever made but one of the best movies ever made period   if you dont enjoy godzilla for all its wacky cheesiness youll find no cheese here just a fantastic story about characters you care about and want to protect
Dec 24 2023,positive,this was an outstanding movie and a good alternative to the more over the top shenanigans of a legendary godzilla movie  thats not a knock on those movies i love the role they play also  after shin godzilla i was disappointed that it didnt get a sequel because it was so different and explored avenues that the franchise never had done before i was really pleasantly surprised by how much i liked the human characters in this movie  for once i wasnt always anticipating the next godzilla sighting  thats not something you can usually say about a godzilla movie and it wasnt that godzilla wasnt exciting and incredible it just was a great overall experience      you dont need to be a godzilla fan to love this movie  thats the biggest compliment a movie like this can earn
Dec 24 2023,positive,what a great godzilla movie it recaptures the feel of the original where godzilla is an existential threat to the people of japan also no suitnation here this godzilla is executed with modern special effects that are scary and real godzillas initial appearance and indeed the whole movie is probably too intense for younger viewers this is an adults godzilla and his appearances are rationed enough that you dont get used to his size and destructiveness and since it is a period piece set in the post war 1940sit is also a window on postwar japan and the hardships endured by its people i find it better than the latest warner bros monster universe movies you may genuinely be moved and cheer by the end and yes its subtitled but it is not to me overwhelming and nor did it take me out of movie i happy i go to see it on the big screen
Dec 24 2023,positive,best remake of all of legendary monsters
Dec 24 2023,positive,godzilla minus one balances crazy monster action with story and heart unlike other godzilla movies this one has human characters that you care about an absolute ride from start to finish
Dec 24 2023,positive,movie is a great visualization of post nuclear japan it also reflects on japanese experiences post war and theres the added excitement of a giant monster wreaking havoc
Dec 24 2023,positive,terrific movie  the visuals story acting and overall vibe of the movie really pulled me in  glad i saw it in the theater to get a fuller experience  im not a big subtitles person but this didnt draw away from the movie at all  highly recommended
Dec 24 2023,positive,amazing film incredible special eff3cts  take note disney this is how to make a good and profitable movie
Dec 24 2023,positive,best version of godzilla i have seen in film and the characters are well developed
Dec 24 2023,positive,probably the best movie i saw all year its a post war drama about guilt sorrow and redemption that just happens to have a giant monster wreaking havoc    the story is great there are times you forget its a godzilla movie and this is not the godzilla who is here to protect humans nope this one is an absolute destructive menace    highly recommend even if you are not a fan of monster movies see it on the biggest screen possible
Dec 24 2023,positive,excellent ive never been a big fan of godzilla movies or similar monster movies but this was quite the achievement godzilla has never felt more threatening and its all due to the character work done here we want the destruction to stop and the characters to win this is intimate story that gives you a bit of everything
Dec 24 2023,positive,this more than makes up for the disasters from the night before that were silent night and the shift very happy with how fun this movie was and how solidlywritten and well paced it was godzilla was a fiercelooking badass and i liked the human characters stories but what does the minus one mean inquiring minds want to know video review youtubewrgiy4eakw
Dec 24 2023,positive,well scripted logical action and rapid character development good intense action
Dec 24 2023,positive,totally enjoyable like any zilla flick of course it has its campy side like the monster standing somehow as it decimates ships in the middle of the ocean but overall great monster some surprisingly solid character development a clear narrative arc and interesting reflections of postwar japan
Dec 24 2023,positive,it was a well written story with amazing effects the period in what it was set is amazing it is a no bs movie that stays on track with what its about
Dec 24 2023,positive,godzilla japanese ww2 movie is good shocking
Dec 24 2023,positive,best godzila movie in all of theman absolute must see
Dec 24 2023,positive,campy sincere emotional human story godzilla especially his atomic breath is awesome thank you toho
Dec 24 2023,positive,awesome movie with a surprising ending
Dec 24 2023,negative,i dont understand the praise this film gets boring disappointingly predictable hammish script and acting and it continually invalidates any build up of stakes you could cut edit the film into a threescene short film and it would be better
Dec 24 2023,positive,by a measure the best godzilla film yet that measure is the films humanity and outstanding performances the beast is a backmeasure but never disappoints
Dec 24 2023,positive,whether your a godzilla fan or not everyone can enjoy this movie 
Dec 24 2023,positive,one of the better godzilla ive seen long time

Dec 24 2023,positive,great movie absolutely amazing
Dec 24 2023,positive,absolute perfection
Dec 24 2023,positive,incredible must watch emotionally thrilling and powerful
Dec 24 2023,positive,if you are a fan of the original godzilla movies youll appreciate this movie go see it
Dec 24 2023,positive,seeing godzilla 2024 was almost like seeing godzilla 1954 but without raymond burr     godzilla looked the same almost like being brought in from the back lot storage for 70 years the destruction scenes were a bit better but only a bit     this version is entirely spoken japanese captioned with english it did remind me of the original so if youve never seen the original you may enjoy the throwback video  i had seen the original several times but did enjoy this version
Dec 24 2023,positive,wow such a good movie
Dec 24 2023,positive,possibly the greatest movie of the decade the human story was almost as powerful as the godzilla story on the edge of your seat the whole time 
Dec 24 2023,positive,very well done for a godzilla movie  the acting was superb and putting the story at the center of wwii was an excellent idea that gave the film heart  all human emotions are on exhibit in this one
Dec 24 2023,positive,i had no clue what to expect from this movie what a surprise it was great i can remember when i was much much younger and saw the raymond burr dub in version this movie used that old one as a script it was like traveling back it time as the movie progressed i was on the look out for similarities  i  wasnt disappointed  the sound track was the glue between the two movies this was an updated version i will be seeing it again awesome
Dec 24 2023,neutral,i just dont see the appeal to this movie if you are a huge godzilla fan then go see it if you are not its a pass
Dec 24 2023,positive,not just a great monster and effects but strong plot and endearing characters
Dec 24 2023,positive,exceptional storytelling im going to see it for a second time
Dec 24 2023,positive,best action movie of 2023 go see it in a loud theater the sound mixing and vfx are fantastic
Dec 24 2023,positive,the story of godzilla minus one was very good and the story was a little emotional but a very good movie and i like the design of godzilla  and the movie is my top 10 favorite ones of the year
Dec 24 2023,positive,i liked the call back to the original films  i liked the care to historical detail  i loved godzilla  the cgi for godzilla was great and the atomic breath was so awesome  i liked the symbiology and the characters  the characters were better than in the other movies  i loved it when godzilla threw the boat
Dec 24 2023,positive,excellent movie just like watching back in the day  but much better
Dec 23 2023,positive,i was a well done return to godzilas roots a love story where the main characters overcome their past and find each other and redemption with a giant monster thrown in to add tension suspense and trials for them
Dec 23 2023,positive,amazing special effects and good beginning
Dec 23 2023,positive,just came back from the cinema i actually cried this is a drama movie first with some godzilla sprinkled through
Dec 23 2023,positive,excellent one of the best godzilla movies ever
Dec 23 2023,positive,its a must my favorite movie of all time now
Dec 23 2023,positive,omfgodzilla you have to see this movie terrific human destruction godzilla
Dec 23 2023,positive,in short minus one is my favorite movie of the year and possibly the best godzilla movie i have seen     it does a fantastic job of creating characters that actually feel real and meaningful to the story where previous godzilla movies have often had shallow or underwhelming characters that serve to bridge the gaps between scenes where the titular monster is on screen minus one has established a set of characters that genuinely feel like the primary focal point of the film the characters are wellwritten and feel so legitimately human that they steal the show from godzilla  something that works wonders for the pacing and narrative of the movie and makes godzillas actions feel much more meaningful     in addition the visual effects of the movie feel phenomenal godzilla movies have a history of requiring some considerable suspension of disbelief to make the monsters feel real this is a trend that i expected to see carried on into minus one especially with its incredibly small budget however the look of the movie is nothing short of phenomenal i never felt like the movie was ever cutting corners or trying to keep its effects within budget the shots of godzilla and the general feel of the movie as a whole feel very similar to the original godzilla but put together in a way that holds up to the modern cinema standards     all together i personally feel like this is the best movie ive seen this year and highly recommend anybody  not just godzilla fans  to watch this entry into the series
Dec 23 2023,negative,youve got to be kidding me why is the ratings so good for this movie depressing very little godzilla action and just sad sad sadmaybe this is what everybody likes nowi went to watch this because everyone rated it sooooo goodwhats the deal cmon ive totally lost my trust in rotten tomatoes and anyone who reviews it now
Dec 23 2023,positive,amazing movie and definately the best movie ive seen this year and one of the best ive seen in a long time the story was excellent acting was great cgi was good especially considering the budget some parts did look unsual however they obviously stood true to the original design of godzilla the atomic breath was undoubtly phenomenal
Dec 23 2023,positive,raw  emotionally charged  fantastic in all regards
Dec 23 2023,positive,i liked the movie its different from the others with the same theme the scenes are good and so are the actors
Dec 23 2023,positive,easily the greatest godzilla movie of all time
Dec 23 2023,negative,seriously unless you like a speed reading session not enjoyable
Dec 23 2023,positive,i usually never write reviews but this one deserves it the story is fantastic the characters are fantastic the cgi is amazing for the budget i could go on forever so ill stop this movie feels like a modern version of the original godzilla in the sense that it isnt overly americanized with nonsense humans and destruction to mask a nonexistent story go watch this movie in theaters while you can you will not regret it this is the best godzilla movie out right now not including the anime trilogy which is ultimate perfection
Dec 23 2023,positive,a phenomenal addition to the franchise godzilla minus one brings back the horror element of the franchise that the original movie introduced minus one has everything you would want from a monster movie starting with a fantastic godzilla design intriguing characters brilliant acting and a interesting plot
Dec 23 2023,positive,the best monsterkaiju movie ever made hands down  it is actually more of a drama with a human element anchored by incredible action scenes and special effects
Dec 23 2023,positive,i have given this a top rating and like all reviews it is entirely subjective but i would like to offer some context first     as a genxr i have grown disillusioned with movies over the past decade at least to the point where until seeing this film i havent been to the cinema for over six years i know there has been good films out there over but having seen so many underwhelming movies over the years i have turned to apathy due to fear of being let down again and just not bothered     i had heard a lot of positive things about godzilla minus one as a fan of japanese entertainment and had decided to give it a chance once it was released here in the uk but when it did i had got cold feet and decided not to bother however i had went to the cinema the other day to see this on an impulse and was blown away by it     im not going to do a indepth review of this movie as other people have done such a better job but i want to describe my feelings about this why i had given it such a high rating and why i have renewed faith in blockbusters now     it is simple that at the heart of this film is not a monster going on a rampage but a disaster movie where a group of people are thrust into the destruction and mayhem caused by this monster and do their best to survive it     as the film focuses on the characters rather than overblown cgi and action sequences i was sucked into the world of these characters their fears their problems and yes their hopes for survival and it made me care for them  and become overcome by their emotional struggles     sure some of the heart string pulling has been done plenty of times before and parts of it is corny but the story is so strong the direction brilliant and the acting amazing that it didnt bother me and i let myself get carried along on the whirlwind of emotions that the film threw at me     as i had mentioned at the start this is purely subjective and  if this film had come out at a time where the overall quality of movies is more superior as to what it is now the film may not have had the same effect on me but it isnt and because of this i feel justified in giving it such a high rating     i know people may be put of because it is a monster movie but i had said it is more than that and is highly recommended to watch
Dec 23 2023,positive,an emphasis on story and plot wonderful cinematography godzilla is both magnificent and terrifying
Dec 23 2023,positive,absolutely amazing the fact that this movie with less money actually did a better work than hollywood movies
Dec 23 2023,positive,a love letter to both the japanese godzilla and hollywood blockbusters of old  larger than life while still grounded by a hard hitting story of humanity that keeps the audience invested in the human characters  if this is the future toho envisions for godzilla i cant wait to see what happens next
Dec 23 2023,positive,godzilla minus one proved to be one of the highlights this year at cineworld its surprisingly optimistic exploring survivors guilt and posttraumatic stress disorder takashi yamazaki gets the balance spot on between drama and spectacle with a decent storyline a movie that must be seen on the big screen
Dec 23 2023,positive,this movie was just incredible first godzilla movie to actually make me feel for the human characters in a while definitely one of if not the best godzilla films to date and it will probably become a timeless classic great tone setting great moments of feeling despair along with the humans and that atomic breath scene in ginza was just phenomenal the atomic breath was so powerful the buildup was beautiful and so was the result of that long buildup i wont drag this on but i think most people will agree that this movie is a mustsee movie for all people godzilla fan or not
Dec 23 2023,positive,you go to a monster movie and a masterpiece emotional movie breaks out one of the best movies of the year unlike the schlock that is out the last few years must see
Dec 23 2023,positive,easily the best godzilla movie its the only one of them thats ever made me cry
Dec 23 2023,positive,this is what godzilla needs to be
Dec 23 2023,positive,godzilla minus one ditches cliche monster movie tropes and focuss and a character driven narrative highlighted by tension provided by godzilla himself
Dec 23 2023,positive,best godzilla movie ever we so enjoyed the dramatic acting and special effects 
Dec 23 2023,positive,absolutely amazing  unlike recent godzilla movies the creature in this movie as tangential to the story  it was really about what makes a person brave and making the right decisions to show this  great acting great visual effects and great ending
Dec 23 2023,positive,first time seeing a godzilla film and i highly enjoyed it

Dec 23 2023,positive,omg dude like this is amazing i definitely prefer this over the american versions no shade it portrays godzilla in a light that we havent done in so long in some parts the cgi is spotty but its overall the best godzilla film ive seen so far as to make an account to give a good rating 1010 would recommend

Dec 23 2023,positive,best godzilar movie with original theme on the big screen    if hollywood can produce jaws than godzillar has found japan     takashiyamazaki done a smashing job with this original  postwar theam and yes godzillar is terrifying mean  bad and ugly     its not all about godzillar hes  carnage and distraction rather the unique ballance the  japanese director  brings to the script with  its centeral characters the  drama is ausum takashi yamazaki includs a fantastic love story twist power of family and friendship that  bollywood will take time to catch up with     yes you will be on your toes but you will appreciate why takashi yamazaki took time to build up the key characters for and explosive and interesting ending     let me know what you think     its a  movie
Dec 23 2023,positive,this movie is amazing  you wouldnt expect to get sad from a godzilla movie other than 1954 but it made me quite emotional  the characters are great godzilla is great visuals are great soundtrack is great  please watch the movie

Dec 23 2023,positive,amazing best movie of the year
Dec 22 2023,neutral,good but a little long
Dec 22 2023,positive,ive seen most of the godzilla movies including the original and hollywood and i would say this is the best  this one is focused more on the human drama which is believablerelatable and adding to that the godzilla was terrifying with good cg technology  some audiences gave some applause at the end and so did i
Dec 22 2023,positive,really good movie   the visuals and story were great  the characters within the movie were also engaging  really glad i saw it at the theater to enjoy being fully immersed in the fun  recommended
Dec 22 2023,positive,best godzilla movie best movie i have seen in theaters in a long time
Dec 22 2023,positive,1 tenth the budget and way better than anything hollywood dreams of producing
Dec 22 2023,positive,so good and emotional my favorite godzilla movie so far
Dec 22 2023,positive,one of the best movies of the year
Dec 22 2023,positive,the movie was a great work of toho studios this one goes years before the original 1954 movie this one where the japanese had no aircraft and old out dated tanks also there war ships were the weapons had been removed this was only a couple of years after wwll this was the agreement with the the allied nations
Dec 22 2023,positive,well acted well directed well edited a little slow at a few different points but just an excellent movie all around
Dec 22 2023,positive,better than anything coming out of hollywood
Dec 22 2023,positive,movie of the year and its not even close i went to watch a monster movie and got a heartfelt movie about the human wartime struggle and survivors guilt a modern masterpiece go see it if you can
Dec 22 2023,positive,this movie is very good
Dec 22 2023,positive,a great kaiju monster film and also a surprisingly emotionally dramatic film about a young man coming to terms with war trauma
Dec 22 2023,positive,i love godzilla as well as the strong themes that thread through the entire cinematic universe in godzilla minus one the characters and storytelling are compelling watching the struggles evoked so many emotions the action had me awe struck as well there were many scenes that were shot so brilliantly i noticed in the moment just how perfect that were  this is a must see if you love godzilla but also if you love a great story depicting the struggles that many people go through every day
Dec 22 2023,positive,this was an incredible film from start to finish and was firing on all cylinders with the writing directing and acting such an interesting take on the godzilla franchise that we havent seen in a while with the recent hollywood adaptations the human story line and character development were as good as it gets and hollywood could certainly learn a thing or two from it definitely a must watch in theaters if you can its easily one of the best films of the year and one of the best godzilla movies ever if only this film had been marketed in the us it could have blown up so much bigger but most people didnt even know it was in theaters
Dec 22 2023,positive,a amazing story about the pain of war and the trauma that followed after it getting down to what godzilla was always supposed to be a monster that means something a must see movie
Dec 22 2023,positive,fantastic all around movie that anyone can enjoy a fun action war movie thats full of heart and creativity while also quite grounded and personal for a movie with a giant atomic lizard that is it does get a bit goofy here and there but surprisingly you will buy into the majority of the movie little to criticize much to love here from yet another great godzilla film
Dec 22 2023,positive,its was incredible what the director did with such a small budget the destruction caused by godzilla atomic breath was on whole other level it was like him dropping another atomic bomb on japan
Dec 22 2023,positive,better than i expected wonderful cinematography and the storyline was moving would watch again just for the special effects 1010
Dec 22 2023,positive,i was nervous with the subtitles absolutely worth it best monster movie in a long time and i actually felt connected with the characters
Dec 22 2023,positive,ive seen this movie four times and i now am confident that it is the best godzilla movie ever surpassing the original the story is one of personal honor and family built around the kings appearance near japan at the end of world war ii the acting is superb everything is treated seriously its not like the cartoonish godzilla movies of the 1960s it offers a new perspective of godzillas threat several instances show him menacing ships at sea the cgi images of him raising hell on land are magnificent and theres nothing quite like watching half of a navy destroyer coming flying across the screen after godzilla has ripped it apart and thrown it away its not simply an exceptional godzilla movie its not simply a good science fiction movie its an outstanding movie period
Dec 22 2023,positive,one of the greatest godzilla movies to be made with not only a action fuelled kaiju destruction but with a compelling human story which is a rarity for a kaiju film the design of minusgoji is also quite amazing combining pieces of past form with a modern feel you should watch now
Dec 22 2023,positive,excellent truly great storytelling and the special effects are mind blowing highly recommended to see on the big screen minus one truly delivered a mustsee movie
Dec 22 2023,positive,the best godzilla movie ever
Dec 22 2023,positive,best godzilla movie so far in my opinion great story arc characters you feel invested in and of course great monster action too
Dec 22 2023,positive,its amazing movies remake from 1954
Dec 22 2023,positive,if you are a movie person who watches movies not in to godzilla that much this could make you love the godzilla franchise the film is just amazing also keep in mind this film has a budget less than 15m and is far better than any hollywood blockbuster film it wont make much on box office because its underrated asf and the score dont even get me started on that it is amazing  all the fans giving it so much praise is hart warming go watch this film now
Dec 22 2023,positive,the 3rd act was just breath taking and the movie itself is just amazing not a single shot i was board i was always invested in the story chareters and world
Dec 22 2023,positive,the movie itself exceeded my expectations i came into it thinking it would be mainly an action movie but was pleasantly surprised with the nuance and emotional take that the audience felt the one thing i will say though is i was a bit taken out of the movie when we first see a full body shot of godzilla i believe that the form and shape of his body in this movie was an interesting choice
Dec 22 2023,positive,wow this movie hit all the notes not only does it look like it was filmed in the 1950s the cinematography is fantastic the flying sequences containing the main character are so well filmed they catch the spirit of many of the old japanese samurai pictures in fact that tone punctuates the whole movie the casting is superb and even minor characters stand out and deliver a punch there isnt one goofy special effect shot anywhere if you like the genre then only one word describes this movie outstanding
Dec 22 2023,positive,no words can describe breathtaking
Dec 22 2023,positive,the movie makes you feel immersed into the humans lore and care enough about them to feel absolute terror and anxiety whenever godzilla is on screen left my eyes wide my chin hanged and tears in my eyes the writing and the visual effects make minus one a must watch godzilla movie
Dec 22 2023,positive,amazing film waited 39 years for a movie like this
Dec 22 2023,positive,the best godzilla movie to date
Dec 22 2023,positive,over acting was a bit much
Dec 22 2023,positive,this is a true movie
Dec 22 2023,negative,movie was absolutely horrible godzilla on screen for a total of 20 minutes the lead character cried the rest of the entire movie the film and special effects were middle school theater class quality completely low budget launching a japanese movie in us market in japanese with subtitles is lazy film making marketing and editing
Dec 22 2023,positive,an absolute masterpiece start to finish   a godzilla movie where youre actually sympathetic to the human characters i didnt think it could be done    its an absolute triumph
Dec 22 2023,positive,really surprised that the movie was this good even with the subtitles had great story aside from godzilla wrecking havoc my grandkids loved it
Dec 22 2023,positive,it was the best godzilla movie ever and i have seen them all
Dec 22 2023,positive,amazing telling of the story with the focus being on the people rather than feeling they were in the way of the story as they do in the current american remakes  gripping beautiful portrayal and incredible effects especially considering the budget
Dec 22 2023,positive,absolutely amazing story every second was entertaining by far the best character story in a godzilla movie ever cgi was absolutely amazing especially for a 15m budget
Dec 21 2023,positive,this movie was beyond amazing to me i havent seen all godzilla films but this one is by far is the best godzilla movie ive seen its one of the most tragic heartfelt emotionally engaging dramatic and beautiful movie ive watched the story was incredible the acting the cgi the effects the music it was just incredible
Dec 21 2023,positive,godzilla minus one was amazing i was unsure what to expect when going in but i am glad i went amazing
Dec 21 2023,positive,besides being one of the best godzilla movies its one of the best movies made  even my 8 year old grandson who kinda kept up with the subtitles said it was a great movie
Dec 21 2023,positive,while i typically havent gone to movies with subtitles i was very happy that i chose to go to this one im a big fan of movies of this genre so i may be a bit biased but the film stitched together a great storyline with wonderful graphics there was not too much cgi that has made other movies seem cartoonish the acting was appropriate and when our dear friend godzilla is onscreen it is truly intimidating and jarring  the dialog is just enough to become engaged with the characters and feel for them as they pursue their goals the subtitles are well spaced that you dont feel youre reading versus watching a movie ultimately the two hours flew by and i would highly recommend this film
Dec 21 2023,positive,best godzilla movie ever atomic breath scene was terrifying and awesome it is a mustsee movie
Dec 21 2023,positive,amazing film easily in my top 3 films of the year
Dec 21 2023,positive,excellent movie best movie ive seen in years definitely a message to woke hollywood we dont need 150 million dollar budgets overdone on the cgi and force fed messages and narratives just a great story and characters cant wait to get the 4k blu ray
Dec 21 2023,positive,honestly i expected this to be a phenomenal godzillainstallment but was disappointed the after effects of japan losing the great war is interesting and the storyline of a kamikaze pilot who failed was new but overall it was lacking the overall umph to make this the best godzilla movie of all timenot even close
Dec 21 2023,positive,this was far and away the best movie of 2023 and quite possibly the best godzilla movie the characters were so well written and acted perfectly it really made me care about the story more than just the specticale of godzilla
Dec 21 2023,positive,hollywood shall learn how to make great monster movies its not always about cgi and how good your actors are in portraying their role only its about the chemistry and how they are invested in the whole screenplay
Dec 21 2023,positive,great movie with a solid plot that doesnt need to rely on any gimmicks the story is well executed and the cg is amazing
Dec 21 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is one of the most gripping and satisfying godzilla movies i have ever seen as a huge godzilla fan i would have to say that this movie has become my all time favorite godzilla film what makes this movie standout from the rest of the previous godzilla movies are the human characters for the first time i actually cared about and was moved by the story of our main characters you feel for all the characters of this film and are at the edge of your seat every time the big guy appears on screen this is definitely a movie that needs to be seen in the theaters
Dec 21 2023,positive,good movie with great effects
Dec 21 2023,negative,very slow too much whining and crying unlikeable main character and left much to be desired i honestly wonder if i watched the same movie as all the other people who wrote reviews
Dec 21 2023,positive,story line was average and could have used a little action defiinite a lull in the middle of the moive
Dec 21 2023,positive,best godzilla movie ever a perfect film
Dec 21 2023,positive,the best godzilla movie including the original
Dec 21 2023,positive,godzilla minus one speaks on many levels its not a simply monster movie it aim at personal fear as we  face and reflect our own monsters in life fear very emotional movie and perfect character development
Dec 21 2023,positive,the first time godzilla has been scary in a long time the plot is amazing as well  the character writing is amazing too the perfect movie
Dec 21 2023,positive,fire the plot is the reason why this film should win an oscar 
Dec 21 2023,positive,beautiful and brilliant film i love the mix of history traditional japanese cinematography music campiness and fantastic story telling that brings this to life  its not over the top cgi or camera tricks just honest fun and filmmaking
Dec 21 2023,positive,one of the best gz movies to date  really fresh take on the japanese perspective although elements of the story are a bit too formulaic
Dec 21 2023,positive,its a great movie with actually amazing human characters normally in godzilla movies i dont care about humans but that doesnt apply to this one
Dec 21 2023,positive,one of the best action and emotional movies of the year
Dec 21 2023,positive,it was amazing go see it in a theatre while you can
Dec 21 2023,positive,watched for a second time loved it
Dec 21 2023,positive,this was hands down the best monster movie and the best godzilla movie ive ever seen and ive seen them all this was stunning i highly suggest anybody even nonfans of godzilla see this movie cuz its really really well made
Dec 21 2023,positive,really enjoyed the movie with my wife great action and a compelling found family story wrapped in one
Dec 21 2023,positive,this movie is great although it starts off slow at the beginning it picks up speed when godzilla makes an intimidating and terrifying appearance
Dec 21 2023,positive,ive seen all the showa films the 80s 90s and american films this is one of the best godzilla movies ive seen
Dec 21 2023,positive,best godzilla movie ever the story was awesome action awesome wow
Dec 21 2023,positive,beautiful movie well crafted with a unique human story first time i have seen the kaiju story line enhance the human story should be best foreign film of the year and maybe a nomination for best film as well
Dec 21 2023,positive,well written and brilliantly acted movie i was entertained through out  worth seeing
Dec 21 2023,positive,my new favorite godzilla movie and my film of the year this is what godzilla should be an epic ode to the origin of the giant lizard monster
Dec 21 2023,positive,as a long time godzilla fan this movie is fantastic a must see
Dec 21 2023,positive,i enjoyed this movie
Dec 21 2023,positive,this is a great story on many levels great humanity and action in the same movie
Dec 21 2023,positive,awesome killer classic monster movie of epic proportions
Dec 20 2023,positive,i love that godzilla looks like an actor in a giant rubber suit while also somehow looking streamlined with excellent cgi the character story is definitely cheesy and full of hero drama tropes characteristic of this type of action film but its the perfect level of drama for the type of film it is the whole theatre ended up cheering out loud for shikishima noriko and little akiko so it obviously was effective story telling definitelya solid 455
Dec 20 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is a true kaiju masterpiece good godzilla action with a truly heartwarming and compelling story filled with grief and anguish and the metaphor of what war actually brings  the awesome sound editing in the film is truly enriching you can actually feel like youre actually there and youre gripping on the edge of your seat when you see the destruction that godzilla brings and the havoc and destruction that is afterwards you truly feel it this is finally oldschool godzilla back on the big screen and its truly one of the best godzilla films ever made right up there with the original 1954 classic
Dec 20 2023,positive,this was the most impactful godzilla movie i can remember seeing since the original both the us version with raymond burr spliced into the japanese cut of the film for the sake of american audiences and a subtitled version of the original film i now realize i need to rewatch an excellent way to spend time at a cinema
Dec 20 2023,positive,awesome movie very well produced and directed the effects were amazing and the way they captured the emotions and thoughts of the csast were amazing godzilla was a beast the design and overall physiology of him were second to none the overall plot and how it all tied in were phenomenal
Dec 20 2023,positive,the greatest godzilla movie ever made it did godzilla right and it did all the humans right
Dec 20 2023,positive,this movie is the greatest and most story driven godzilla movie i have seen in a while i love most godzilla movies but this is just on another level
Dec 20 2023,positive,i have been a godzilla fan all my life and have seen many different interpretations and directions for the movie and character to go this is easily one of the best if not the best ive ever seen since the original you dont even have to be a godzilla fan to appreciate this one absolutely epic mastery and vision for what godzilla is and means 100 percent must see movie and a breath of fresh air for what movies have been over the past decade which is over uses and bad cgi in the laziest writing and acting era  ever this one has everything you wants movie to have and then some saw it 2x
Dec 20 2023,positive,the mc should of called kamen rider agito to beat godzilla
Dec 20 2023,positive,an awesome kaiju movie with just 15 million budget shows up what went wrong in hollywood     godzilla is badass like never before and the movie is full of emotions and breathtaking godzilla animations this is the way
Dec 20 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is a standalone godzilla movie from japan it brings the franchise back to its roots where godzilla is a monstrous force of nature an allegory of war while i do love the western monsterverse franchise it is mostly for seeing godzilla or kong fight another giant monster the writing and characters have never been a highlight in that universe does godzilla minus one deliver more than the monsterverse    firstly godzillas design is spectacularly frightening his roar is menacing and his heat rays are some of the best and most impactful blasts ive seen from godzilla every godzilla action set piece is terrifying and tense i love how these sequences are filmed from a human perspective so we get to truly see the scale and how dangerous godzilla is the music score by naoki sato is phenomenal his subtle orchestral score compliments the scene and illustrates the pain and struggles that japanese people in ww2 went through he then uses a strong powerful orchestral score for godzilla to show how he is bringing back the pain again his use of the godzilla theme is effective every time the visuals and cinematography look great while the cgi can be a bit wonky sometimes for the most part it looks good especially for godzilla who looks awesome it is honestly astounding how good this film looks for a movie under a 15 million budget    what this film succeeds at in comparison to western godzilla movies is having compelling human characters that you truly care about the characters are all suffering in some way from world war 2 whether it is ptsd or loss youre watching these characters try to overcome and push through this dark period the camaraderie and family dynamic is at the core of all the characters and it is extremely touching to watch i was especially rooting for the main character to get development just because i wanted to see him be happy that is why for the first time i was rooting for godzilla to lose as i didnt want to see our characters get hurt i also love how the story doesnt shy away from the negative aspects of japans government during ww2 the human drama is wonderfully engaging and can even tug at the emotional strings which is such an achievement in a godzilla movie    overall godzilla minus one is not only a terrific godzilla movie its an amazing movie period this movie shows that you can tell a great story with great characters and still have godzilla as a major element not only that you can still make a great looking movie with good cgi on a low budget the cg in this movie looks better than a lot of these western movies with 200 or 300 million budgets godzilla minus one is must watch and i highly recommend going to a theatre near you to experience it in all its glory
Dec 20 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is quite simply the best godzilla movie to date it handles the same themes as the 1954 original but better this film addresses the human cost of war defeat and tragedy with a level of passion and honesty that the original was simply not allowed to
Dec 20 2023,positive,characters were actually compelling writing was quite good and the appearances of godzilla were aweinducing and even a bit frightening at times puts hollywood to shame and with far less of a budget than any dedicated blockbuster mustsee
Dec 20 2023,negative,maybe i missed it but i hate trying to read a movie if that was the case i would read the book instead reading and watching at the same time is annoying
Dec 20 2023,positive,modern reincarnation of the 1954 classic that preserves the themes that make 1950s sci fi so beloved but modernized for a new generation  this is classic godzilla force of nature and destroyer
Dec 20 2023,positive,nothing happens until the last 15 minutes of the movie  well made movie no doubt  but little suspence  too simplistic in how it developed characters  the last scene is averageok nothing to write home about  the first 80 minutes were laboriousdullslow
Dec 20 2023,positive,i never expected a godzilla movie to be legitimately amazing and i love godzilla haha
Dec 20 2023,negative,wow this thing is severely overrated besides some excellent special effects the acting is pretty lame and its slow
Dec 20 2023,positive,i did not know what to expect but certainly a masterpeice on human emotion shame culture and war was not in my imagination this was beyond a movie i have ever seen the emotion storytelling and hope it brings you makes you question so much of your surroundings how much do we suffer because we think we should this movie is truly one i will never forget and it reminds me of the magic of a movie done with love passion and a story to tell thank you for this dream come true of a movie and for making me feel and want to be alive  a nod to the characters theme
Dec 20 2023,positive,this was a fantastic movie and displays incredible moviemaking and storytelling im just amazed to see a godzilla movie where godzilla is secondary to the characters and everything theyre already facing
Dec 20 2023,positive,this is the godzilla movie weve been waiting for
Dec 20 2023,positive,best movie of 2023 the characters have such depth and interact with such emotion godzilla was fantastic wasnt cheesy or bad looking it was a very intelligent movie where the characters actually think of how to combat godzilla instead of shooting it nonstop even though it doesnt do anything like other entries in the series it is a bit odd watching an entire movie in japanese but after the first few minutes i didnt even realize i was reading subtitles way better than anything hollywood has created since endgame
Dec 20 2023,positive,this rebirth of goji was one that we never knew we needed until we got it paying homage to earlier iterations but also branching out with new ideas and stories
Dec 20 2023,positive,it was almost a perfect movie but it is the best godzilla movie and its the best movie of the year
Dec 20 2023,positive,one of the best films ive seen all year this is probably the first time ive seen a godzilla film that was focused more on the people than the monster and you became invested in what happened to them that speaks volumes to the writers as well as the actors
Dec 20 2023,positive,an absolute masterpiece pure cinema a godzilla movie that makes you actually care about the human characters and is just such an overall compelling story meant to be watched in theaters such a beautiful film one of the if not the best godzilla movie ive ever seen dont listen to adams review he doesnt know what a true movie is please do yourselves a favor and go watch this movie you wont regret a damn thing
Dec 20 2023,positive,outstanding possibly one of if not the best godzilla movie made not to mention the meager budget it was made with hollywood needs to take some notes o this one
Dec 20 2023,positive,best godzilla movie of all time 1010
Dec 20 2023,neutral,im a big godzilla fan of the originals  was very excited to see this i think they executed it very well for the 15m budget but in the end it really was just an average godzilla film
Dec 20 2023,positive,this filme is like perfectan good ilumination actors that act perfectlyan good historyperfect scenesjust go watch
Dec 20 2023,positive,absolutely incredible movie one where you actually care about the human story everything from the music to the acting was excellent a must see do not be afraid of subtitles it is not a lot of reading
Dec 20 2023,positive,the perfect monster movie a true masterpiece that deserves to smash the billion dollar box office bar it has to be seen at the cinema to get the proper godzilla experience cannot wait to watch it on bluray at home
Dec 20 2023,positive,god damn gozilla is terrifying and broken stories of human characters shed tears through and through a beautiful movie
Dec 20 2023,positive,this isnt just a great godzilla movie its a great movie in general and one of my favourites of the year it seamlessly blends modern action with the feel and spirit of the originals not only is this the bestlooking godzilla but its also the most badass and terrifying one too the human characters are all so real and fleshed out that by the end its so satisfying to see the conclusion
Dec 20 2023,positive,a japanese historical wwii drama which happens to feature a giant lizard  the plot plays out as expected but has a more traditional style focusing on the characters as they struggle to deal with the aftermath of the war and a new threat of the giant monster  cultural issues such as the virtues of honor and survivors guilt are well portrayed by the varied cast of characters but it does make it a bit slow to get going and some scenes felt labored  godzilla itself looks impressively menacing and the special effects and scale of destruction invokes shock and awe  great use of music and an emotional ending even if it was a bit too happy
Dec 20 2023,positive,this is what you should expect from a godzilla movie
Dec 20 2023,positive,a healthy amount of monster fun and human drama and a tad more brutal then most godzilla movies i have seen definitely a really fun and epic watch
Dec 20 2023,positive,its just a good movie  perfect
Dec 20 2023,positive,a love letter to japan in all its grand stained glory a film that honors its survivors and encourages unity courage strength honor and most importantly redemption to live not for yourself but for those who will come after promising them a better future oh and its also a monster film too hahahah the cgi is gritty and impressive i was stunned and the story line is engaging its a different godzilla movie also the ending  although not so epic as our american counterpart has an interesting resolution not seen on the big screen some of the acting teeters to overt but each character has a moment of growth and thats powerful to see 
Dec 20 2023,positive,a little slow through the middle but more than makes up for it with the emotional ending
Dec 20 2023,positive,i have to say this was about as perfect and balanced that a film can be nowadays it had a great story filled with emotion good characters ive been watching godzilla movies since the early 80s and this is about the best one ive seen
Dec 20 2023,positive,this type of godzilla movie is the best it was almost as good as shin godzilla i loved it
Dec 20 2023,negative,i didnt like this movie at all
Dec 20 2023,positive,it was amazing absolutely breathtaking i was on the edge of my seat the whole film

Dec 20 2023,positive,that was probably the best toho old school style  godzilla movies and theres probably gonna be a part 2
Dec 20 2023,positive,i wasnt aware this movie had came out a few days after its release in north america been a big godzilla fan since i can remember and was not sure if i was going to see it theaters i watched the all 3 trailers and a couple of spoiler free reviews on youtube and saw how much love and hype this movie was receiving so i figured why not i went last sunday and to say that i even cried in a movie let alone a godzilla film says a lot to me about this movie so well i got a group of 3 friends and invited my mother out last tuesday since she got me into the franchise as far back as i could remember this is my second favorite movie behind jurassic park and the only movie ive paid to see more than once to mr takashi yamazaki sincere thank you for bringing godzilla home and the phenomenal work you did on this film you have a created a masterpiece of a film i hope toho continues to work with you

Dec 20 2023,positive,wow great movie back to its roots  love the japanese versions always better than american hollywood garbage
Dec 20 2023,neutral,good story line and not a bad movie at all but it annoys me when movie characters make stupid decisions that could have saved them it makes no sense
Dec 20 2023,positive,it was a deep investigation of grief guilt and godzilla

Dec 20 2023,positive,this movie is overrated some of the acting was pretty terrible and the effects werent very good dont get me wrong it wasnt all bad but when i see scores over 90 percent i was expecting something better than slightly above average now comparing this movie to godzilla 1985 then i would agree to the high praise
Dec 20 2023,positive,toho has gone back to its original roots i could have not asked for a better godzilla film
Dec 20 2023,positive,scariestlooking godzilla ever great effects loved the pacing lots of quiet human moments interspersed with suspense and mayhem my teen and tween loved it too
Dec 20 2023,positive,ture to the godzilla story line excellent special effects and its the 70th anniversary edition
Dec 20 2023,positive,one of the greatest godzilla movies ever made acting was top tier
Dec 20 2023,positive,the effects were good but the human story really made this one of the best g movies ever
Dec 19 2023,positive,even better than the 1939 classic awesome story line godzilla does major destruction the only way godzilla can bets monster movie version to date
Dec 19 2023,positive,the only godzilla movie to make you care about the humans western interpretation cant even begin to compare in terms of writing or direction

Dec 19 2023,positive,amazing movie best godzilla movie ever with a real emotional human drama interwoven great story superb acting i also think this has the best incarnation of godzilla ever  dont make this godzilla angry i didnt mind the subtitles on this particular movie because lets face it godzilla is a product of japan and in many ways the japanese language made the movie feel even more authentic to me

Dec 19 2023,positive,this is my top godzilla movie now
Dec 19 2023,positive,well done the combination of japan at its lowest state in history people coping as best as they could then having gojira show up worked my only complaint is that the director should have had occupying troops in the background as they were common in tokyo at that time especially in the ginza area where the wako department store had been made a px they at least did show the px sign
Dec 19 2023,positive,brilliant storywriting really captures grief guilt and shock realistically some suspense was ruined because you knew something good was going to happen but the dramatic scenes still were adrenaline filled despite that
Dec 19 2023,positive,good movie with characters you care about also godzilla is there
Dec 19 2023,positive,best godzilla movie ive seen good story and well developed characters in addition to the usual monster rampage particularly liked the way  godzilla looked close to his original incarnation and wasnt reinvented
Dec 19 2023,positive,when i saw the trailer i thought this would be a definite no for me i couldnt do with 2 hours of a large creature destroying downtown tokyo following that i did listen to a review which indicated that there was so much more to this film hence today i thought i would give it a try glad i did it offered so much more  is the best godzilla movie ive seen

Dec 19 2023,positive,my take on this movie was an absolute jaw dropping experience from the start easily the best godzilla adaptation i have ever watched not too mention a real human story was mixed in to keep the viewers interested on not only a godzilla appearance but an understanding of the human characters in the process i would watch this again and again destined to become a real classic

Dec 19 2023,positive,not a big fan of subtitles but this was far better than any hollywood godzilla film
Dec 19 2023,positive,ok story mostly bad cringeworthy acting not sure why they subtitles kept saying fighter jets instead of fighter planes its post ww2

Dec 19 2023,positive,japan is trying to rebuild after wwii but now they have trouble defending themselves from a natural enemy from odo island a creature called godzilla  the plot was well done the monster was scary the only thing i didnt like was i had to read the entire movie in the english subtitles instead of being able to watch more of the graphics i had to constantly look down to keep up with the plot i think it would do better at the us box office if it had english dubbed in for the characters speaking

Dec 19 2023,positive,one of the best movies of 2023 for sure on my top 5 of this year it brings humanity in to a monster movie that you rarely see these days and it looks very good for a movie that was made with only 15 million and by far the best godzilla movie i ever saw

Dec 19 2023,positive,wonderful movie  the story is good and godzilla stays true to its original character the subtitles were easy to follow and do not take away from the story even for the reading impaired and the only reason more people havent watched this movie is because the fear of subtitles but it is well worth the movie experience

Dec 18 2023,positive,best godzilla movie in many years
Dec 18 2023,positive,even if you put aside the godzilla stuff this movie has a ton of heart it made me cry and feel for the characters it has very good pacing godzilla is pretty cool himself too
Dec 18 2023,positive,godzillaaaaaaa    i am very pleased  its in full subtitle and the cinematography was just genuine   specially the way godzilla moved and the storyline everything about this film i fully enjoyed and it payed homaged to the original film     great original style of filmmaking making it look like the early style of godzilla great use of technology that was for that era the film didnt adapt any new style of cgi or weapons or vehicles and kept this film in its true form     some of the scariest godzilla monster scenes in it  makes you  feel like youre physically there in the chaos and looking into the eyes of godzilla which past filmmakers have failed to do so instilling fear   excellent performance from all cast     a brilliant film keeping its authenticity to the true classic that we all love
Dec 18 2023,positive,nailed it  by far the best human characters in a kainu movie   a great human story set in the end of ww2 into reconstruction    not much new in regards to big g himself but the character drama around him id top notch
Dec 18 2023,positive,i think over allthe best toho godzilla movie made and perhaps better than legendary  it was reminiscent of the past great godzilla movies but was focused on engaging characters in reality godzilla was not the main character as it often feels in the other movie the acting was also dead on and a more realistic solution to dealing with godzilla rather than a made up super weapon giant robot or some alien species    i highly recommend this movie
Dec 18 2023,neutral,wanted to see some monster fights lol
Dec 18 2023,positive,omg this movie slaps see this movie

Dec 18 2023,positive,i went to the movies expecting a big dumb action movie which i love dont get me wrong but this was so much more the human story was original and compelling and the action sequences and vfx were outstanding i didnt expect a godzilla movie to bring me to tears but sobbed for a good 15 minutes towards the end not just the best godzilla movie ive ever seen one of the best movies ive seen in a while 1010 recommend

Dec 18 2023,positive,being better than other blockbuster cgi messes doesnt make it an actually good movie
Dec 18 2023,positive,great onscreen story telling  and then the way how godzilla makes his first appearance fantastic
Dec 18 2023,positive,genuinely the best godzilla movie in years the perfect homage to the big one the one japanese giant that shook the world by storm so many years ago with shotforshot recreations of its monochromatic godfather and the most emotionally compelling post wwii japanese plot if ever experienced this  is one for the history books 1010
Dec 18 2023,positive,no words can possibly describe how great this movie is from the acting to the design of godzilla
Dec 18 2023,positive,amazing even out 8 yr old daughter was able to read the subtitles and enjoy it expect this to win best foreign film oscar loved how they respected the style of the original and the heart of the story

Dec 18 2023,positive,this is the best movie of 2023
Dec 18 2023,positive,an amazing cinematic masterpiece ive been a godzilla fan since the 1970s and godzilla minus one delivers on so many levels that hollywood never strives for both a great monster story and an even greater human story i found myself sympathizing for the main human characters a definite must watch and an instance classic
Dec 18 2023,positive,i cannot believe this is knocked down two points  this movie was absolutely perfect for what it was  the complex story and characters were completely compelling  i did not want this movie to end  the nod to prior godzilla movies in the motion of godzilla and some of the rampage scenes was too sweet to pass up  truly an amazing piece
Dec 18 2023,positive,visually entertaining engaging story and relatable characters thoroughly enjoyed
Dec 18 2023,positive,godzilla in perfection 
Dec 18 2023,positive,wow just wow   everything at the point   thrilling   vfa just wow  amazing blend of love family honor everything beautiful   
Dec 18 2023,positive,great history its more than just godzilla you care about the people and what is happening to them
Dec 18 2023,positive,pretty good movie but expect godzilla to show up a few times
Dec 18 2023,positive,pretty good reminded me a lot of the older style godzilla films some epic moments the only thing that im knocking on is the story line a little over board for my taste 
Dec 18 2023,positive,this movie had a wonderful synopsis of a young japanese soldier who had to return to his homeland after the devastating bombings a lil hollywood flaire is added such as the fact that he is a kamikaze pilot who didnt actually commit suicide and its super tied into the movie bruh too cheezyyyy but cool godzilla tho cgi was trash but design was kinda cool and unique i like the more radioactive elements where his body was burned after his beam his spikes going up made me go up big dawgggg but eh typa movie more like emotional pacific rim with historic tied situation  watch it why not
Dec 18 2023,positive,must see godzilla movie  it is in japanese and subtitled in english  interesting  very well done
Dec 18 2023,positive,this is the best movie ive seen in the theaters in decades im not a monster movie fan and went with friends what a show seriously the story telling in this movie is better than anything america has produced in my lifetime im 28 nothing touches the way the story moves me in this film ive never been interested in foreign films but i plan on watching everything this director and writer have done words cant describe go see it movie of the decade
Dec 18 2023,positive,great character development great story and special effects
Dec 18 2023,positive,did not expect a poignant meditation on the brutal effects of war on humanity but i guess i should not have been surprised godzilla has always been a metaphor     our family loved every minute of this film it was brutal beautiful surprising and shocking best movie of the year for me
Dec 18 2023,positive,one of the best movies of 2023 and probably the best godzilla film learning more about godzillas origins symbolism and his past representations has made me love this film even more if i had seen all of the godzilla movies i believe that this would still be on top this movie doesnt even feel like a godzilla movie it feels like an interpersonal drama featuring godzilla it has some of the most beautiful gripping and heart reaching characterrelationship development that i have ever seen and it truly drives the movie it is the strongest part of the movie yet it doesnt sacrifice the quality of the action godzillas presence alone is the most menacing and intimidating i  have ever seen it and his destruction is unparalleled making him the first godzilla to actually scare me from the little that i have learned about godzilla movies this truly feels like it does justice to the monsters original purpose and symbolism his shear viciousness and relentless power is chilling and this paired with the next level character development achieves something that no other action movie has for me it made me truly worry for the main characters lives the only criticisms that i could barely conceive would be that it is very corny and on the nose with a lot of its dialogue but its a godzilla movie so that is expected and some could argue that there are some slight pacing issues but overall the pace feels very fluid and the 2 hour run time suits the movie perfectly i will forever be astounded that this movie was executed with a 15 million dollar budget especially because godzilla vs kong the last godzilla movie to come out had 140 million dollars more to work with and it still wasnt as good in my opinion go see this movie on my second watch it was sad to see that there were only two other people in the theater give this movie the love it deserves you will not regret it
Dec 18 2023,positive,i dont normally give reviews but this movie was outstanding it was not your typical godzilla movie the story line and human struggle with honor for country and forgiveness was felt through the characters the mostly old school godzilla scenes with modern but subtle technology was a nice change 100 recommend this movie to any and all i also found myself getting choked up a few times
Dec 18 2023,positive,this movie had me with a roller coaster of emotions
Dec 18 2023,positive,a great movie a classic was not dissapointed it was unexpected and gave hope
Dec 18 2023,positive,great movie good story great effects     the only thing that was a little annoying was the subtitles the acting and thoughtful script made up for it though

Dec 18 2023,positive,the best movie of the year so far

Dec 18 2023,positive,great story well told and acted loved all the details about japanese history and culture and the love story between the two leads great ending too
Dec 18 2023,positive,spoiler alert        for someone who has been obsessed with godzilla since i was a child i cried a lot when godzilla was killed   i loved this movie  godzilla was so angry and i love his new spikes  loved the soundtrack that stayed true to the godzilla series from the past  if you are a godzilla fan you wont be disappointed  will be seeing it again

Dec 18 2023,positive,toho delivers on an epic level minus one perfectly portrays survivors guilt and ptsd while highlighting how a country thought of the people who fought for it godzilla being an ancillary character only used when absolutely needed is the perfect example about how sometimes less is more the sound design the score the visuals all come together to form a perfect film
Dec 18 2023,positive,exactly what you want from a godzilla movie its not some lame hammed up western take on godzilla compelling characters emotional moments tense action it was absolutely refreshing and not like anything coming out of hollywood in recent years
Dec 18 2023,positive,fantastic horroresque drama with an amazing godzilla interpretation
Dec 18 2023,positive,albert einstein is the real main character
Dec 18 2023,positive,this movie really outshines modern hollywood cinema this is the best movie of 2023 i have not been so interested in watching movies in so long until the release of this movie with hollywood creating the image of godzilla as an antihero character minus one easily makes the top of the board the graphics as well as the story were very well done for the budget of this movie this film is extremely way above standards you care more for the human characters and fear the creature in the correct representation of godzilla toho did amazing in not only bringing back the original feel of the godzilla we all knew and loved but they revamped him to be 10x better and much more scarier a job well done
Dec 18 2023,positive,wow i have to say that godzilla 1 is about the best movie i have  seen in a long time it had a tiny budget7m but it was absolutely fabulous the character arks and there were many of them were brilliant the acting was outstanding the special effects were fabulous for the budget emotional thoughtful  complex and a great ending

Dec 17 2023,positive,gozilla minus one is a beautiful piece of cinema  an example of what all films should aim to be  what i mean is a beautiful use of atmosphere instead of music to allow you to feel the weight of everythingput you in the shoes of the characters youre supposed to lovehate

Dec 17 2023,positive,incredible film full of meaningful symbolism beautiful story and very cool action with 1940s era technology amazing i went more than once to see this in the theater
Dec 17 2023,positive,totally worth the subtitles
Dec 17 2023,positive,i will say nothing more than an absolute unequivocal masterpiece
Dec 17 2023,positive,this movie has so much character that it feels like you are there think of games such as red dead redemption 2 for example its a compelling story that fully gets your attention and you you are on the edge of your seat the whole time
Dec 17 2023,positive,i have never been more terrified of godzilla than i was watching this film
Dec 17 2023,positive,great actors everything about the movie was great
Dec 17 2023,positive,im not typically a fan of this type of movie but went for date night with my husband  i ended up enjoying it it was cheesy in that old godzilla sort of way but then really grew on me because of the story  it was also interesting to think of japan in post world war ii times the rebuilding the pressure of being a kamikaze pilot who returned etc
Dec 17 2023,positive,god what an absolute blast of a movie complete mustsee
Dec 17 2023,positive,this was probably the best godzilla movie yet it actually had a great story line
Dec 17 2023,positive,this is absolutely the movie of the year for me it utterly floored me     i never expected to be so truly terrified of godzilla this is just groundbreaking
Dec 17 2023,positive,perfect movie 100 movie of the year
Dec 17 2023,positive,there is nothing to dislike
Dec 17 2023,positive,easily the best film ive seen all year id seen the trailer which looked great and then heard all the good reviews for it on youtube and the internet so i decided to watch it if and when it was released here     it was brilliant its more accurate to call this a film with godzilla in it rather than a godzilla film with side stories its more about the healing and redemption after the trauma of war and loss the importance of being part of something whether its your family your crew or the taskforce     the acting is great you feel for these people and want to see some sort of happy ending for them and instead of cheering godzilla on this time you want the big guy to lose    the actions scenes are epic whether is the first attack on their boat to the final battle the ginza scene is particularly jaw dropping the special effects were for the budget absolutely top notch its hard to believe a film like this was made for only 15million especially when you consider how bad some of the multimillion dollar flops like the marvels or the the flash looked and they cost nearly 20 times as much    watch this film you will not regret it my film of the year easily
Dec 17 2023,positive,very true to the godzilla lore
Dec 17 2023,positive,one of if not the best movie i watched the acting was very good and made sense with the story and every bit of the movie is worth watching they also waste no time showing godzilla this movie makes us think that the japanese people werent the villains of rhe war but one of the many victims and godzilla is the reflection of the effects of the war on japan 1010
Dec 17 2023,positive,who thought we could get a movie with thrilling action great practical special effects and a riveting human story such a realistic view of the trials of the people in post wwii japan told through lives of ordinary people i was so invested in the story and the characters brilliantly punctuated by well timed apperances of godzilla every attack by the famous kaiju was full of suspense and you are genuinely scared and devastated for the victims this is my movie of the year
Dec 17 2023,positive,gonna have to change my viewing preferences to international movies
Dec 17 2023,positive,an absolutely gripping human story where godzilla is the inciting incident rather than the protagonist it is brilliantly executed brilliantly acted and without a doubt the best movie you will see in 2023
Dec 17 2023,positive,best movie of the year
Dec 17 2023,positive,oh is it amazing for new fans and old fans godzilla minus one is incredible from the acting plot and emotions are amazing i mean godzilla and the characters and their emotions and growth through the movie are all too real i wont say spoilers for the ending but the ending was amazing sure i absolutely hate cliffhangers but this one was good for the ending and a great start for the sequel so if you havent seen godzilla minus one yet watch it its worth your time
Dec 17 2023,positive,unbelievably good no expectations going into this movie but almost immediately i was genuinely engaged in the human drama played out through the movie it 100 enhanced rather than detracted from the film i saw a glimpse of the struggle the japanese citizens likely faced for real after ww2 that i had never thought of before real people having to pick up the pieces after a brutal war and the gritty reality of hunger uncertainty and raw needs of survival fictional though it was i would have never dreamed id be engaged at this level in the human side of a godzilla film by far my favorite godzilla movie of them all and ive seen almost all of them
Dec 17 2023,positive,a very different movie than i was led to believe but this film is more fully formed than i could have guessed  solid character building and performances as well as what we all came for  some giant lizard destroying stuff  very nice job on many details of the period and in the effects work   loved that it was all in japanese with subtitles at the showing i went to  it felt that much more authentic   lots to wow at and lots to awe at  go see it
Dec 17 2023,positive,this is the movie right here the best godzilla film ever made its pretty much perfect everything youd want a godzilla movie to be this movie packs literally everything 1010
Dec 17 2023,positive,hollywood take note best movie of the year easily must see in cinema i never in a million years thought id tear up watching a godzilla movie and actually care more about the humans than godzilla  perfect pacing great acting compelling characters and the most brutal godzilla weve seen i will be going to see it again

Dec 17 2023,positive,this movie is truly powerful in almost every way and is really close to being a perfect movie compared to everything else the movie accomplished delivering great visual effects on a shoe string budget is almost not worth mentioning     this movie takes its time to deliver great characters and takes all of them through a journey that is natural and compelling every character goes through a satisfying arc and there is basically no scene wasted and the music is truly sublime     godzilla minus one deserves to be nominated for multiple oscars and deserves to break 100m in us domestic box office

Dec 17 2023,positive,the plot featured a poignant story of a man  wrestling with  a cowardly act that cost the lives of those he could have saved it tormented him throughout the film  this was more a drama that happened to have a monster in it  it was at time absolutely terrifying
Dec 17 2023,positive,great pace and ending
Dec 17 2023,positive,i like this film it reminds me of the 50s godzilla but in the 40s during world war 2 i like it so much i hope they get other monsters in the sequel like angurius rodan mothra and king ghidorah i am hyped in the sequel and i hope it is canon to king kong 1933 the original
Dec 17 2023,positive,beginning is a little slow but pieces together nicely
Dec 17 2023,positive,amazing story well acted and good big monster movie
Dec 17 2023,positive,was great from start to finish with all the damage godzilla caused loved this new take on him
Dec 17 2023,positive,it is not hyperbole to call godzilla minus one the greatest entry in the franchise since its inaugural release
Dec 17 2023,positive,one of the best that toho has ever put out by far  exceedingly impressed with what they did to the king great music total package is well done
Dec 17 2023,positive,great movie made the old fashion way
Dec 17 2023,positive,what a freking great movie unique story line and character development attention to details in the storyline is amazing highly recommend this movie a must see
Dec 17 2023,positive,i died i literally died but the movie convinced me so hard to keep on living that i had to return and rate this fiver stars
Dec 17 2023,positive,i made an account just to review this movie this is one of the best movies that i have ever seen and puts current western hollywood to shame i cannot praise this movie enough congratulations japan on a masterpiece of a film
Dec 17 2023,positive,godzilla minus one brings an menacing godzilla and it shows how terrifying this gigantic monster is every character in this movie has a good story arc and whenever a character in the movie has an emotion you can fell their pain the plan to take down godzilla was extremely creative an absolute watch
Dec 17 2023,positive,great fun everything we love about godzilla well done
Dec 17 2023,positive,absolute masterpiece who knew godzilla could bring such heart passion and intensity a must see on the big screen if this film doesnt get oscar considerations the academy will lose whatever credibility it has left
Dec 17 2023,positive,i think this was probably one of the best action movies ive ever seen the effects were impeccable the acting was superb it had a beautiful and touching storyline something you would not expect in an action movie like this id be willing to go see this more than a few times at the theater because it was money well spent and just an incredible movie
Dec 17 2023,positive,the movie was intertaining and exelent     5  stars  would see again
Dec 17 2023,positive,spanish es una de las mejores películas de godzilla que eh visto    english its one of the best godzilla movies ive ever seen
Dec 17 2023,positive,this movie surpassed my expectations truly the best film of 2023 and one of the best godzilla movies ever made
Dec 17 2023,positive,absolutely the  best movie i see on 2023 and possibly one of the best godzilla movies
Dec 17 2023,negative,a visual feast that lacks emotional depth and strong character development godzilla minus one forgets the cardinal rule show dont tell as the film develops its characters mostly through dialogue excessive exposition nullifies the impact of emotional moments since the audience is told the emotional state of a character instead of showing us through the actions of a character or through dialogue with subtext nevertheless the eponymous godzilla is beautifully realized through stunning effects and creative cinematography if you prefer the power of western storytelling the plot may not grab your attention but the wellchoreographed action and destructive capabilities of godzilla will keep you somewhat engaged
Dec 17 2023,positive,i do not think i have been this surprised and completely blown away impressed than this movie for anyone worried about the length the reading subtitles and the small budget of the film stop worrying and go see it trust me i had my doubts but this is not something you want to miss and the 8 movie ticket and one gallon of gas you may use up is more than worth it
Dec 16 2023,positive,excellent movie great fun not perfect  the plot loses credibility about 15 minutes from the end but great 1950s style retro movie scifi movie and monster movie the film also deals with post traumatic stress disorder and mental illness  unusual in a lead character  a brave move  symbolism of godzilla as the nuclear bomb the japanese people had to face twice the movie is perhaps a little more emotional than western audiences are used to however still great fun to watch
Dec 16 2023,positive,had high hopes going in and godzilla minus one exceeded them more soul and thought than any of the nonsense put out in the monster universe is among my favourite foreign language films
Dec 16 2023,positive,the bw version of this amazing flick is an awesome homage to the king of monsters the deffinitive godzilla presentation
Dec 16 2023,positive,the best godzilla movie ever made
Dec 16 2023,positive,an absolute masterpiece essential viewing for fans of kaiju and godzilla
Dec 16 2023,positive,saw this in theaters on opening weekend when it released here in canada went with my best friend as a way to rekindle our friendship and boy did it toho has blessed the cinemas with another masterpiece that easily trumps the legendary pictures version of godzilla an absolute must see would definitely watch again
Dec 16 2023,positive,took me back to when i was a kid and watched the old godzilla movies it had a good story had some humor not over the top cgi my 16 year old daughter loved itexcept for the crying kid said she annoyed her lol
Dec 16 2023,positive,brilliant in every way the best godzilla film ever made
Dec 16 2023,positive,one of the best godzilla movie ever made
Dec 16 2023,positive,this film is a must watch all of the characters are compelling in their own way the jokes in this film are funny and godzilla mwah chefs kissnow the only gripe with the film is that the end is really predictable with the fact that the main character who is shown to kamikaze into godzillas mouth to kill him is alive because he ejects himself at the last minute
Dec 16 2023,positive,the movie was set in 1945 post wwii  although subtitled it was easy to follow and actionpacked  took my 13 yr old and he had no issues following along  we both enjoyed it
Dec 16 2023,positive,i am a lifelong godzilla fan ive seen every single godzilla movie watched them all in order literally written a thesis about godzilla for my degree and did presentations on the franchise to say i love this franchise is an understatement     this this is the best godzilla movie that has ever been made ever this movie is amazing it has everything youd expect from a godzilla movie it isnt godzilla if it doesnt have a little bit of ridiculousness and cheesiness which i loved to see however it goes so much deeper the human story was moving and unexpected showed the real side of ptsd and loss and actually made me cry more than once i dont cry at movies the animation of godzilla is phenomenal and the new effect of his nuclear breath was shocking intimidating and incredible 2023 finally allowed for a serious godzilla movie that does godzilla his power his terror his majesty his destruction and his horror all true justice having such a fantastic and moving human story only elevated this movie more     my review does this movie no justice none at all it is now my favorite movie of my life thank you japan for making and sharing such an incredible story with us this is how godzilla was always meant to be perfection
Dec 16 2023,positive,yes thats what im talking about had the same budjet as theres something in the barn and was awesome theres something in the barn was not that one is awful godzilla minus one clearly had a passionate crew and takes movie making seriously
Dec 16 2023,positive,the best film i watched this year i felt obliged to register just to write this review master piece
Dec 16 2023,positive,with a budget of 15000000 it really goes to show what someone is capable of using for best foreign movie i have seen after godzilla 2000 i recommend this movie to anyone godzilla fan or not
Dec 16 2023,positive,absolutely deserve it to see
Dec 16 2023,positive,i loved it it was very realistic
Dec 16 2023,positive,this movie is dull of emotions good story telling and makes you want to participate in the downfall of godzilla i wish hollywood would understand and remember how cinema is supposed to be made
Dec 16 2023,positive,really emotional with decent pacing whenever i thought things were getting slow a cg scene would show up next the characters are not perfect but they all fill their role everything came to a satisfying ending
Dec 16 2023,positive,scripted with creativity and heart taking place in beautiful scenery and sets engagingly shot and accompanied by a phenomenally dreadful and energetic score this addition to the franchise delivers lots of moving movements in the storyline as well as drastic action and tension as soon as the infamous lizard himself steps onto the scene ryûnosuke kamikis performance is shockingly touching especially during his emotional outbreaks while godzilla is designed and written in a successfully horrifying way the movie starts with a surprisingly strong scene starring a truly scary juvenile godzilla and a cast that reacts to him accordingly in authentic panic the characters are interestingly written especially the protagonist and mostly well casted including sakura andô which was a smart choice for her role godzillas writing and design is terrifyingly crafted sharing some similarities with the ones from the older movies the atomic breath and following explosion scenes are intense theatrical feasts with its sound design and visuals even though there are such great qualities to offer there are some disappointments as well a scene which seems to be some sort of an american broadcast with a montage of clips felt really out of place and totally unnecessary adding nothing new or interesting to the plot which the audience didnt know already there is also another montage including the main characters passing some time together which could have been handled better with a tone that would have fit the rest of the movie and a better soundtrack now coming to the obvious the movement animations on the fully grown godzilla are too often stiff and puppetlike when he doesnt attack or swim one scene in particular stuck with me in which the hero flies his plane into the monsters mouth however godzilla stays completely frozen and motionless even with the massive impact thats a bit of letdown but it essentially doesnt ruin the authenticity of the monster the effects and the rest of the production are absolutely impressive for the budget of only 15m nonetheless
Dec 16 2023,positive,the best movie of all time
Dec 16 2023,positive,only downfall was that its in japanese  great movie
Dec 16 2023,positive,i am a huge godzilla fan the creature was amazing and hes not the good monster any more th storyline was so different and done so well highly recommend
Dec 16 2023,positive,welll it was one of the greatest japanese movie ever and the ending twist was shocking and apparently  its not over since they show at the end that hes still alive for a sequel
Dec 16 2023,positive,easily worth the price of admission you have excellently written characters with actual arcs that you come to enjoy and root for that being said the second half of the movie does drag just a bit the finale however does make it worth it
Dec 16 2023,positive,fantastic movie great story and well balanced not too much screen time for godzilla and not too much screen time of characters loved how they kept the feel of the original feel of godzilla 
Dec 16 2023,positive,great movie its more about how hard it was for the people in this community struggled post world war then they had to deal with an additional problem of godzilla its also a story about the main characters journey for redemption highly recommended
Dec 16 2023,positive,what i liked about the movie is when they created a plan to kill godzilla and it worked and also at the start when it said in 1945 it reminded me of hiroshima and nagasaki the bombings and it was tragic especially after the bombings you have to face another threat which was godzilla and i thought it was sad when buildings were destroyed and they had to keep rebuilding
Dec 16 2023,positive,best movie i have seen all year the story characters themes and godzilla itself was great i am so happy i decided to watch the movie with my friends     if you have not watched i highly recommend you go watch it
Dec 16 2023,positive,while most godzilla movies can suffer from its human cast minus one thrives because of them not inspite of them the themes that created the beloved kaiju are back and come with a bigger gut punch than ever this is a cant miss for anyone thats a fan of the king of monsters
Dec 16 2023,positive,a so adaptation that has been a masterpiece sense its release with great acting and crafting of godzilla this is one of the better godzilla films ever made i appreciate it a lot
Dec 16 2023,positive,we definitely need more films that arent made in hollywood japan and south korea truly are leading the way both in films and tv shows a new beginning indeed  great film by the way
Dec 16 2023,positive,my god you get godzilla 2 hours long and a good story with great actors the setting right after world war 2 was alsof a great idea i loved this thank you yamazakisan
Dec 16 2023,positive,an outstanding post war drama hidden within an amazing godzilla film hes terrifying from the 1st appearance by the way ill delve no further as to not ruin it just go watch it
Dec 16 2023,positive,easy the best godzilla film in decades
Dec 16 2023,positive,compelling character story lines and jaw dropping kaiju destruction made for a truly captivating movie kariko was adorable too
Dec 16 2023,positive,much better than expected godzilla was awesome
Dec 16 2023,positive,despite what hollywood says i was able to enjoy a movie that features people who dont look like me  turns out what people enjoy watching is a good story  thankfully there are other people producing good moves  this film was excellent story acting visuals all superb
Dec 16 2023,positive,fantastic film literally just got out of the cinema in exeter in the uk  i held off on trailers and spoilers and the film definitely did not disappoint  a little slow in places but when it kicks in it really kicks in the final act is astonishing  i have never watched a movie that utilises silence in such an amazing way
Dec 16 2023,positive,we saw it two days ago as has been said about jaws a movie which this one pays homage this would be a really good movie even without a sharkgodzilla the characters were interesting the movie set a steady pace that never got slow or overwhelming the effects were great and the monster was terrifying there was actual menance coming from this depiction which has been missing for a long time  be aware that the movie is subtitled but it was easy enough to pay attention and still follow the dialogue  this is an outstanding movie and well worth the acclaim it has been receiving
Dec 16 2023,positive,one of the most intense watches in decades rewatchable movie that can be family fun or great on your own
Dec 16 2023,positive,very good movie the human characters are also great a godzilla movie you must watch
Dec 16 2023,positive,it is a huge masterpiece it deserves the praise
Dec 16 2023,positive,this movie is shockingly amazing
Dec 16 2023,positive,emotionally gripping
Dec 16 2023,positive,i have been a fan of this franchise since i was 5 years old with godzilla vs megalon being my first movie i ever saw  godzilla minus one is just soo different but still keeping that classic godzilla that utterly destroys in a more maniac crazed creature this time this one deserves a trilogy easily  must see even for general audiences
Dec 16 2023,positive,it is the best godzilla movie of the era  hail to the king of the monsters 
Dec 16 2023,positive,nice  the best filme 
Dec 16 2023,positive,godzilla fan or  not this is a mustsee film that hopefully gets nominated for the oscars it is not about fantastic cgi effects and a loud destructive kaiju monster but a heartwarming film that also keeps you at the edge of your seat feeling the emotional pain of the human characters that fight through adversity by digging down deep saw it twice within a week since it was slatted to be a limitedtime showing it received 98 ratings from both the critics and audience viewers that it finally was advertised during sundays football games and resulted in extending its time in theaters nationally go see it and tell your friends you wont regret it
Dec 16 2023,positive,this is the best godzilla movie ever made and is easily the best film of the year  i dont want to add any spoilers because i think it is best going into this film without any background  all i will say is that is that it subverts any expectations you may have in monster films in general  just go see this in the theater now
Dec 16 2023,positive,recently a friends wild enthusiasm drove him to embark on an 8hour journey to catch a movie whether hes a diehard franchise fan or just slightly eccentric i couldnt resist the intrigue the film in question godzilla minus one was slated for a limited release in select theaters and my friend insisted it was a cinematic gem    returning from his trip he couldnt stop praising this 15 millionbudget marvel claiming it outshone its predecessors intrigued i joined a group of nine for a screening only 2hours from home the following weekend despite the theater being less than ideal the films magnetic pull kept me glued to my seat for the entire two hours    this unexpected gem didnt rely entirely on explosive special effects instead it unfolded as a gripping narrative a rare throwback to when stories took precedence the action though loud and at times comical seamlessly wove into the tale of overcoming adversity godzilla minus one became a story about hitting rock bottom descending even further and then summoning the will to rise again    my friends insistence that godzilla symbolizes more than a monstrous entity proved accurate godzilla is a metaphor for any catastrophic event encouraging me to focus on character dynamics rather than awaiting destruction i found myself emotionally invested shedding a few tears along the way i wasnt the only one    whether or not youre a godzilla enthusiast godzilla minus one deserves the acclaim its garnered take a chance the worstcase scenario is ten bucks out of pocket and a couple hours of your time at best youll find yourself labouring over the right words for your first ever review compelled to share the magic    chris yuill  godzilla minus one 2023  55    edit the film is now showing in my hometown 12 of us watched it last night it was even better than the first time and only 15 minutes from home
Dec 16 2023,positive,i was ready for a bad ass kaiju monster movie and i got that but what really hit me was a touching story    bravo
Dec 16 2023,positive,that was so super fricking awesome  dare i say my favourite godzilla film i do dare  godzillas design in this is elite and he was completely bad and badass dont get me wrong i love the current monster verse films but this was something else    the music in certain scenes was amazing some music i recognised from godzilla king of the monsters both films used it well    quick mention that i really enjoyed the humans in this film that is a part which has been a let down in some monster verse films i think the humans in this really helped elevate the film above the monster verse ones for me i actually cared about the characters
Dec 16 2023,positive,best godzilla move yet amazing how it went from a dark tone to a hopeful tone to a happy tone the cgi sometimes did look a bit cheap but apart from that amazing story if you are godzilla fan or not i would recommend watching it
Dec 16 2023,positive,not only is this the best godzilla movie made in my lifetime but im going to recommend it to all of my friends including the ones who arent godzilla fans the characters are vivid and lifelike you will care about them which makes the monster scarier the movie feels shorter than it is because every scene and every shot serves a purpose practical effects and cgi blend seamlessly to create something that is simultaneously true to the original godzilla and thoroughly modern the story has setup and payoff and a few unexpected moments that are thoroughly earned i left the theater feeling awed and refreshed
Dec 16 2023,positive,godzilla minus one has poignant human scenes that hit as hard as godzillas atomic heat ray and i saw this in 4dx so when the heat ray blew up a building you felt it
Dec 16 2023,positive,wow just wow when the first trailer came out i was really looking forward to it in theaters and man it not disappoint the story characters the destruction godzilla himself i definitely recommend this masterpiece to anyone whether theyre a godzilla fan or not

Dec 16 2023,positive,every 10 or so years you get a film that is a must watch in theaters to truly understand the power of the film this is that movie for this decade on par with the opening nights of the first jurassic park the first indiana jones and the first star wars films legendary in every way and an absolutely mind blowing
Dec 16 2023,positive,i have been watching godzilla movies for last 57 years and this is the best movie ive ever watched and first time i cried many times in godzilla movie  this movie is based on how to live in your life  never give up and never die
Dec 16 2023,positive,see it in theaters while you can one of the most surprising and best theater experiences ive had in years i did not have tearing up at the end of a godzilla movie on my bucket list but here we are the production value the acting the directing the visual effects all of it is painstakingly laid bare upon the screen you can feel the handcrafted love in each shot and the passion of their message i beg everyone who reads this if you can only see one movie in theaters this year make it this one
Dec 16 2023,positive,see it in theaters while you can i did not have tearing up at the end of a godzilla movie on my bucket list but here we are the production value the acting the directing the visual effects all of it is painstakingly laid bare upon the screen you can feel the handcrafted love in each shot and the passion of their message one of the most surprising and best theater experiences ive had in years  i beg everyone who reads this see it in theaters as while you can
Dec 16 2023,positive,one of the best films ive seen in a long time gut wrenching characters and a truly frightening godzilla that helped to enhance the humanity that came through in the film great to see in theaters
Dec 16 2023,positive,best godzilla movie yet the filmakers departed from the usual direction of godzilla movies by really telling and featuring a parallel story in place of focusing soley on the monster and his destruction the dialogue between the main characters was a readily believable main theme of the movie supported by the action scenes with godzilla you truly became engrossed in the main characters plight and his redemption some of the acting was still a bit hokey for us but that will be the case in mostly all of these japanese centered movies as seen through the eyes of people foreign to japan excellent script
Dec 16 2023,positive,suspenseful and packed with action great movie
Dec 16 2023,positive,it takes japan to make a people actually want to watch
Dec 16 2023,positive,incredible movie you truly feel and care about the characters along with them acknowledging the original movies
Dec 16 2023,positive,like nothing ive ever seen attempted in the godzilla franchise bold and tender dramatic and quiet gorgeous film
Dec 16 2023,positive,the best thing i seen sense marvel phase one
Dec 16 2023,positive,what a film fantastic piece of work and truly one of the best godzilla movies ive seen respectful of the original while still being its own thing acting was great graphics are great great story line just an allaround great film
Dec 16 2023,positive,this movie was phenomenal in every way  my husband who is in no way a godzilla fan but came with me out of curiosity also loved it for him it was an excellent historical film and he appreciated the symbolism in godzilla the monster  i felt all of those things as well plus i loved the look of this new godzilla
Dec 16 2023,positive,awesome movie the best godzilla movieto date
Dec 16 2023,positive,i like the special effects
Dec 16 2023,positive,this one is an absolute fantastic start of a fresh godzilla film someone that puts actual serious stuff within what makes godzilla special
Dec 16 2023,positive,this is the best godzilla film in decades   wow   this is how a monster movie should be made
Dec 16 2023,positive,hollywood has something to learn from this films team this was spectacular on a budget nearly a 10th of what was already being hailed as the best looking film under 100 million the creator this film has done some incredible work the characters dont feel forced the drama isnt too schlocky the action is heartpounding and the scale is far bigger than some movies with 10 times the budget the story is well paced and godzilla is actually terrifying  i cant imagine how the upcoming warner bros film team feels right now as g1 has set the bar impossibly high for what we can expect from kaiju fare going forward this film restored my faith in action movie filmmaking this year
Dec 16 2023,positive,saw the color version  opening weekend the b  w  version let me focus on the story this time well worth it to see the film again
Dec 16 2023,positive,the movie was so good that it felt too short of a film i loved how it didnt focus solely on the action but the people godzillas rampage affected and once the action began it had more weight to it rather than just meaningless destruction 910
Dec 16 2023,positive,good script and acting which is not expected from a monster movie creature effects pretty good love the classic godzilla roar
Dec 16 2023,positive,fantastic i am a lifelong godzilla fan since i can rememberim 53 now i have never been so into the human characters as i have been with this one i teared up a few times not one cast member phoned it in
Dec 16 2023,positive, spectacular cgi topnotch acting and epic direction make it a mustsee  and the music goosebumps 
Dec 16 2023,positive,best godzilla movie aside the original
Dec 16 2023,positive,absolutely stunning by far my favorite godzilla movie
Dec 16 2023,positive,gripping heartfelt moral questions and answers and an amazing monster movie
Dec 16 2023,positive,may be the surprise film of the season  high quality special effects and a love story about a ragtag family trying to cope with the fire bombing of japan after wwii and then an indestructible monster
Dec 16 2023,negative,one of the weaker entries in the series  a bit slow and generally out of touch with what makes a godzilla movie great
Dec 16 2023,positive,the fact that they could make such a movie in a low budget of 15 million dollars people from disney should just quit their jobs what an amazing amalgamation of great screenplay story and low budget but meaningful vfx
Dec 16 2023,positive,perfectly enjoyable but i felt a little duped by the 98 rating at the time i went to see it its all subtitled so i had to really pay attention but if it hadnt been i probably wouldve zoned out a lot more 
Dec 16 2023,positive,fantastic all around
Dec 16 2023,positive,really enjoyed it hard to look away
Dec 16 2023,positive,best depiction of godzilla ive ever seen and best movie i saw this year
Dec 16 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is the best godzilla movie ive seen in a long time you will not be disappointed go see this movie
Dec 16 2023,positive,godzilla minus one carries on the work of its predecessors once again proving who the king really is minusone is a tragic war drama set in post wwii japanwith godzilla yet it somehow manages to be the best of both genres thought provoking haunting and even scary its a must see for all fans of cinema
Dec 16 2023,positive,probably one if not the best movie to come out in 2023 a powerful commentary of japans experience post world war ii with a shocking 15 million dollar budget this is the movie that shows hollywood what blockbusters used to be and can still be
Dec 16 2023,positive,one of the absolute best godzilla movies ever this movie was amazing godzilla was actually scary the symbolism characters and story were fantastic i got chills when the godzilla theme played
Dec 16 2023,positive,as a godzilla fan i loved this movie  if youve never seen a godzilla film and roll your eyes when you hear godzilla this is the one godzilla movie for you to see  amazing acting from an outstanding cast a heartbreaking moving and inspiring story this is not only one of if not the best godzilla film ever its one of the best films of the year  do not miss out on seeing this in theaters in imax if you can
Dec 16 2023,positive,a solid monster movie if this wasnt a foreign film though and the setting wasnt unique it would be a solid 6510 and without the high praise it has gotten 
Dec 16 2023,positive,amazing  one of the best movies of 2023 
Dec 15 2023,positive,what an absolute delight godzilla minus one is one of the hits of 2023 so far at its heart it truly is a classic godzilla movie from the godzilla walk and its classic backing track however its the story between the makeshift family that stars as the movies true heart and soul of the movie the connection between the characters and their history is so gripping and emotional to the point that its hard to not root for our main cast shikishimas story is one of tragedy yet hopefulness with so many plot points that were littered throughout the movie payed off in such powerful ways the character has his flaws which makes him more relatable and you feel the weight behind every decision he must make in the movie i love that we stayed focused on this makeshift family for the entirety of the film no side missions we are always following the next phase of the group i could ramble on for paragraphs about just how great this movie is thank you japan you have given us masterpiece in storytelling acting characterwork and dread an absolute piece of art
Dec 15 2023,positive,i was not expecting such a complete movie went in expecting a monster thriller left having seen a storytelling delight no doubt godzilla is gargantuan but he wasnt even the biggest part of this movie awesome film
Dec 15 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is the best godzilla film ever made
Dec 15 2023,positive,i can not believe how much i loved this movie the fact that there were so many layers to this film and that in a godzilla film is amazing i love godzilla for what it is but this just blew everything out of the water    just pure cinema of the highest quality
Dec 15 2023,negative,dont believe the hype godzilla movies are not supposed to have deep character exploration   its ok  but really ok the premise is sound  worthy of exploration but in a godzilla movie no there were some gaping historical plot holes and its good enough for someone to tidy it up  get their history right like i say dont believe the hype pity
Dec 15 2023,positive,if you have ever seen a godzilla monster movie on tv as a kid you will surely love this homage from toho movies the drama the plan the plan b the plan b backup plan the wavyhaired scientist the stodgy naval captain the emotionallywracked failed kamikaze pilot the wartorn tokyo the wounded warriors volunteering one more time    there are no plot twists at all but man what a trip down memory lane just pure fun from beginning to end
Dec 15 2023,positive,fully perfectly and heart hittingly encapsulates the emotions and feelings of postwar japan to the point of at times forcing you to sit and think and really feel  brings a whole new view on the original meaning behind gojira as a character and pounds it into your face exactly the way it should be  my only gripe is the unexplained janky movement of godzilla at times almost like hes taking a page of out shins book but its very easy to overlook that considering the quality of the rest of the film  overall an absolute stunner of a film by far the best representation of tohos creation to date
Dec 15 2023,positive,great godzilla movie it had a great story and we get to see who is the ruler of all monsters
Dec 15 2023,positive,blood fantastic best movie ive seen in years
Dec 15 2023,positive,definitely a builder  first 20mins felt like a slowish japanese rehash of jurassic park island and all you know the bit where everyones fave trex dino turns up and starts eating folk one half at a time but slowly you do get to care about the lead character and the rest of the cast and then about half way it gets rather juicy   lots of stomping chomping and pointless merciless killing of innocent folks random ones and maybe even ones you like along with general giant monstering about and destruction nice satisfying ending  although not really anything unexpected  just jurassic park on steroids with an added heat ray but theres nothing wrong with that   better and certainly more satisfying than most of the other  more monied  studio offerings of late well worth watching despite having to tackle the subtitles which im usually one to avoid to be fair and honest the plot is not very complicated so you really dont need to read the subtitles too much  super catchy orchestrated da da da godzilla is coming style theme tune for sure stayed in my seat a bit longer for that at the end    i actually saw this on day of release in uk and i saw the shift before it just as i had some free time knowing what i know now if id only had time for one movie  id have actually picked the shift  although theres not too much in it i just found the shift more compelling overall
Dec 15 2023,positive,i loved this film and it was amazing for anyone who is going to watch this i would strongly reccomend getting ready for the scenes  it made me cry 5 times and im only nine
Dec 15 2023,positive,as i long time godzilla fan seeing this movie was a no brainer that being said in films like this the human element is always an issue for me minus one succeeded in making me become invested in the humans part of the movie and the storyline that followed coupled with quite frankly a great design and execution of godzilla itself this is by far one of my favourite godzilla or kaiju movies heres hoping for a sequel
Dec 15 2023,positive,one of the best movies so gave seen in years made me realize how lackluster so many hollywood blockbusters have become its really a new classic not to be missed it made me cry and actually gave me chills at points hollywood take notes
Dec 15 2023,positive,a wonderfully refreshing take on the very classic story that started it all with a deeply moving human story and everything you could possibly want in a monster movie godzilla as never been better
Dec 15 2023,positive,you dont have to like monster movies to enjoy it you just have to like good movies minus one was fantastic

Dec 15 2023,positive,lots of heart and enjoyed the godzilla action scenes
Dec 15 2023,positive,great subtext acting cgi very good very compelling nothing to dislike
Dec 15 2023,positive,it is more than a monster movie it tells about postwar japan and the difficulties of returning home loss of community and being attacked by a missed off monster very respectful to the origin story will see again
Dec 15 2023,positive,one of the most awe inspiring films in recent memory beautiful cinematography great effects in relation to godzilla and the carnage it delivers beautifully done script with a plot not over simplified or complex but enough to feel invested in the outcome of its characters     as a life long godzilla fan this film has a right to stand alongside the original if not surpass it
Dec 15 2023,positive,what a film history movies fan will love it monster movie fans will love it solid story fans will love it so good and deserves more and more eyes on it
Dec 15 2023,positive,i am fresh out of watching this and my gosh did it not disappoint the hype is real and this puts the american movies to shame only with 15million usd budget and they created this masterpiece this may be the best movie of 2023 and the best godzilla movie ever to come out the ending is crazy and the twists and u feel the raw emotions of the characters plud are actually interesting
Dec 15 2023,positive,such a fking great film
Dec 15 2023,positive,too much dialogue for me but the godzilla scenes was dope wish it was more i kind of liked it
Dec 15 2023,positive,gorgeous movie with an enthralling human cast that drive the story beautifully
Dec 15 2023,positive,its a remake of an old japanese horror film and has english subtitles we were blown away because the backstory makes this a new classic in this genre i would highly recommend the theatre due to action and easy to read subtitles
Dec 15 2023,positive,i cant think of a better godzilla movie currently than this one its so groundbreaking and powerful usually the human story sucks but the in where compels the movie to a level not even the original one could do this is an eye opener for many and i cant recommend it enough such a great movie and it brings back to fear factor for godzilla that we havent seen since shin godzilla and the original 1954 one please go and watch it its genuinely beats every hollywood film this year
Dec 15 2023,positive,never cried watching a godzilla movie  the surprise ending got me good    the love interest who was thought to be dead is revealed to be alive
Dec 15 2023,positive,brutal ground shaking heart pounding  terrifying godzilla minus one is simply stunning   an edge of your seat  emotional tale during postwar japan with many civilians critical of their government actions struggling to deal with lost  to leave the war behind them while in search of redemption to escape the nightmares they witnessed they now have to face another world destroying force   godzilla looked like a love letter to modern  past designs but the sound design is absolutely brilliant making my seat rumble  when akira ifukube original godzilla theme kicked in such a great feeling
Dec 15 2023,positive,if you are a  fan of the original godzilla movie youll enjoy this movie
Dec 15 2023,positive,watch this movie now i havent gone to a single theater to watch a movie since the pandemic and this movie made me do it this is a movie that everyone will enjoy fans of godzilla and new comers this might be the best movie of the year
Dec 15 2023,positive,really really well done  great story and characters  godzilla smashing things was cool too  reminded me of jurasik park and jaws a little bit  the sub titles were not a problem  you will cry at the end
Dec 15 2023,positive,very good and sad movie with a semi happy ending i recommend you to watch it
Dec 15 2023,positive,this is without a doubt the best godzilla movie ever made it sticks to the original idea and premise from decades ago everybody in this film every character has a giant part of the story self reflection about all the circumstances of what this means to them and their future go see it right now
Dec 15 2023,positive,great movie from start to finish
Dec 15 2023,positive,to be honest ive never been a fan of godzilla i wasnt very excited to go see this but i was won over within 10 minutes  i love a good story and that is exactly what this movie gives the characters were written so beautifully the acting is great the cgi is great the cinematography is stunning and godzilla is finally a creature that is capable of utter destruction   i think anyone can appreciate this film its very possibly the best movie of 2023
Dec 15 2023,positive,the best movie ive seen all year and will probably be better than anything coming out in the next year as well i came in expecting another fun but not so great big lizard movie but was pleasantly surprised by the greatness of this movie the movie left me speechless walking out of the theater the problem i always have with movies like this is they dont have meaningful characters and they become the main focus the characters in this movie are relatable and feel real the relationship between the main protagonist and godzilla shows the tenacity of humanity even when in the face of something devastating thats what makes this a good film is the writing and the overall story but it doesnt stop there godzilla in this is by far the greatest iteration of the character when i say it makes the humans seem doomed to fail its an understatement godzilla is a truly monstrous presence that seems to be unfazed by anything anyone can throw at it and thats leaving out the greatest part the atomic blast is amazing the most beautiful devastating and powerful atomic blast ever seen on screen the sound cuts out for a second before the blast hits and then you hear the explosion the suspense it creates even though you know what is coming keeps you on the edge of your seat this movie is amazing spending money on a movie in theaters is a waste of its not this one when it gets a digital release i will be the first one in line to buy it and same with a physical release of it gets one
Dec 15 2023,positive,these actors deserve oscars
Dec 15 2023,negative,fire alarm went off the first 30 minutes of the movie need a refund
Dec 15 2023,positive,this movie by far is the best godzilla movie ever and i believe this is the best movie of 2023   great story great cgi a overall great movie the sub titles really give you the feeling that you traveled across the ocean  just to go see the movie   i would be shocked if this movie does not get nominated for best picture   dont get me wrong oppenheimer in my opinion  is the odds on favorite to win best picture  that was until i have seen this   and for a 15 million dollar budget   wow the special effects look perfect  wow  the cgi looks flawless 15 million budget wow   director takashi yamazaki and toho productions did great  this movie is not only worth 5 stars  this movie is worth 5 excellent stars  great story line     toho productions and director   takashi yamazaki   make this masterpiece for just 15 million dollar budget wow very impressive and refreshing  i enjoyed this movie very much
Dec 15 2023,positive,very nice touch on godzilla movie roots story was absolutely beautiful and stunning did not expect the end which was so good and mc deserved this ending
Dec 15 2023,positive,why is this movie not in 3d this is the type of movie i want to see in 3d

Dec 15 2023,positive,great story excellent special effects beats out the american made ones that have poor quality cgi with little or no plot just a quick money grab two thumbs up for the japanese made hit toho should retract the rights they dishonored your property
Dec 15 2023,positive,amazing   the perfect moive  the acting was great
Dec 15 2023,positive,ive seen more than my fair share of godzilla movies but this one has to be my absolute favorite it might be in my top 10 movies of all time i barely even noticed that it was in japanese because the visual storytelling is so good 100 a mustwatch movie
Dec 15 2023,positive,absolutely the best godzilla movie ever rivaled by only the best of the classics but not only is it one of the best godzilla movie its the best kaiju movie and one of the best movies i have ever seen godzilla minus one is an absolute must see the human cast is amazing their messages of found family is and self forgiveness are some of the most inspiring that is all not to say that the namesake himself is not just as spectacular godzilla godzilla is a true monster there is no explanation as to why hes here or why hes the way he is and there doesnt need to be goji is here to destroy and claim the world as its own i admit i same a little lame saying that but thats what this movie makes it feel like it is a force of nature and there is no stopping it so once more if you havent seen this movie yet go watch it
Dec 15 2023,positive,hands down best movie of the year  most terrifying godzilla ever put on film  excellent characters with depth  fantastic story  this film delivers on every level
Dec 15 2023,positive,excellent film devastating godzilla destruction emotional human story and empowering message about the value of each human life
Dec 15 2023,positive,godzilla minusone is the best godzilla movie for sure i havent seen them all but what i will say is this in every godzilla movie when it comes to atomic breath its used because its cool but in minusone it is used to show the destruction and god part of godzilla the movie focuses on the characters and how godzilla effects them not how the characters can effect godzilla overall a great experience that makes you scared of godzilla again  910
Dec 15 2023,positive,this is a top tier movie i wish america had more movies like this great story characters action effects score acting the human story is actually compelling emotional and engaging which is so rare for a monster movie and godzilla is frightening
Dec 15 2023,positive,a fantastic godzilla movie such a fantastic way to end the year with this amazing movie   this is a must watch you wont like it if you dont like subtitles but if you dont mind it youll love it
Dec 15 2023,positive,the most exhilarating godzilla rendition of its time explodes off the screen thanks to its beautiful cinematography unique effects and pitch perfect script about as close to a balancing act as possible godzilla minus one never feels like its cheating its iconic central figure or the humans characters that inhabit the rest of the story different themes weaved into the subtext of the movie make it perhaps the most universally resonant monster ever made this is a must see that will leave viewers moved devastated and blown away
Dec 15 2023,positive,incredible for a franchise thats lasted 70 years and never stops with greatness
Dec 15 2023,positive,you know you have a good godzilla film when you can feel the terror and destruction that is wrought from the power of a nuclear weapon great setting choice as well
Dec 15 2023,positive,this is a tough review for me i rate 35 but my family rates 45 for a 15 mil budget the acting cinematography cgi and set locales were all fantastic but as for the onscreen involvement of godzilla he was not the main focus the focus of the movie was the character development and story of the people and their backstory i was very impressed with the appearance of godzilla he looked amazing fyi this is a full subtitle movie no english dubbing is available
Dec 15 2023,positive,this is the godzilla movie to see great story loveable characters spectacular visual effects godzilla looks amazing go see it
Dec 15 2023,positive,i cannot tell you how phenomenal this movie is it is suspenseful and emotional and heartwarming and scary and i love it so much

Dec 15 2023,positive,great film  it was nice to see godzilla for a lot longer than in the previous movies
Dec 14 2023,positive,1010 this movie is a must see this movie puts all american godzilla films to shame and shows that quality is always better than quantity
Dec 14 2023,positive,stunning if you consider yourself a godzilla fan you owe it to yourself to see it my favorite movie of the year
Dec 14 2023,positive,wow  its been a while since ive seen a movie this good  the postwwii setting is done very well  the movie uses heartstringpulling human drama to pull you in and get you invested in the characters  its all so realistic and well done that its shocking when the giant lizard shows up  whats godzilla doing in a historical drama  the special effects are maybe half a notch below stateoftheart although the handling of godzillas heat beam is the best ive seen  nothing about this movie disappoints  perhaps hollywood should send  some of their moviemakers to japan for refresher lessons on how to make good movies  go see it
Dec 14 2023,positive,best godzilla i have ever seen what made it so good was how much we were invested in the main characters the music was awesome production even better a must see movie

Dec 14 2023,positive,my wife and i have been godzilla fans since we were little kids and we absolutely loved this movie i even brought my mom with us to see it since she was partly to blame for my love of the giant monsters the cast was great the story was compelling and godzilla was a sight to behold
Dec 14 2023,positive,a fantastic monster movie with the subtext of japan standing up on its own and casting off the united states using the power of the people and not the puppet government the people cant trust
Dec 14 2023,positive,omg one of the greatest godzilla movies i have ever seen  its up there with shin godzilla  love it great story line it had me on the edge of my seat i was scared then very sad  i cried  my grandson loved it and he cant wait to go see it again

Dec 14 2023,positive,it was very good and different with no english but the subtitles was good
Dec 14 2023,positive,i loved this movie everything was perfect loved godzilla the story the actors very cool 
Dec 14 2023,positive,this is everything i want from a godzilla movie take notes hollywood
Dec 14 2023,positive,i liked that it reminded me of a classic godzilla movie but with a storylinesubplot  being in japanese with english subtitles added to the feel of a classic godzilla movie  having been a godzilla fan since being a child in the early 70s the feeling of nostalgia kept a slight grin on my face during the entire movie  the tease of a sequel left me excited for the next chapter in the godzilla saga
Dec 14 2023,positive,we loved it it was the most dramatic and high stakes godzilla movie weve ever seen that keeps you on the edge of your seat best international release ive ever seen
Dec 14 2023,positive,this is not just a great godzilla movie this is a really great film this movie is awesome even if you arent a godzilla fan i highly recommend this movie cause the effects and story are topnotch go see this film
Dec 14 2023,positive,its true godzilla minus one is  well worth it great characters great godzilla  it brings a certain fear back to the monster and and gives the most relatable people in all the series lifespan
Dec 14 2023,positive,strong characters i actually cared about the human characters godzilla had the old japanese film feel while also still being threatening
Dec 14 2023,positive,the best godzilla movie of all time im so happy that i got to watch such a great action packed movie in 4dx it has a little bit of everything love betrayal sadness redemption all the characters were likeable and the plot was very good a definite must see you wont be disappointed
Dec 14 2023,positive,wow this movie is very professionally made not something i would usually like but it is excellent it is also a very thinly veiled look into the soul of japan post wwii and the crazy radical nationalists who brought their country to ruin the producers largely stay away from pointless afterthefact commentary on the atomic bombs themselves and move to how japan found itself where it did in late 1945 but at the same time preserving the honor of the ordinary japanese people who were disgusted with where their fascist leaders took them with no one else to help the spirit of the japanese people rise to fight a real monster as opposed to the false enemy their nationalist government forced them to fight against in wwii an indictment against pointless selfsacrifice but deeply committed to giving everything you have to save others their community and their common welfare is a refreshing theme this movie says it is not about me its about us with refreshing honesty although tastefully done it is a warning about the rise of radical nationalism today especially in america this is an excellent movie for our time thoughtful respectful and deeply japanese plus the subtitles are easy to read for those who dont speak japanese
Dec 14 2023,positive,fantastic movie there are a few minor things that prevent it from being a perfect 5 for me but this is really close to be the godzilla movie ever
Dec 14 2023,positive,greatest godzilla movie ever made by far  masterpiece of a film fantastic character development  just flawless
Dec 14 2023,positive,movie of the year thank you for doing godzilla justice ive been to see this 3 times already and i still want to see it again this is what good movie feels like id forgotten
Dec 14 2023,positive,i have always disliked godzilla much more the american version i was disappointed when i heard i was being taken to watch it seeing subtitles i was worried it would be worse having to read captions but it did not disappoint in the end  this movie is amazing at building suspense and has many twists and turns along with real rollercoasters of emotions  and was amazing with the gfx and sfx dont get me started on the acting i forgot i was even watching a movie i thought i was there i was shaking in my seat jaw on the ground this movie is amazing and one of the first godzilla films i enjoyed they did amazing with godzilla and the main character
Dec 14 2023,positive,best monster film of all time
Dec 14 2023,positive,the godzilla movie ive always wanted to see
Dec 14 2023,positive,solid movie but they couldve had a darker ending to shake things up a little
Dec 14 2023,positive,an absolute masterpiece for godzilla fans and a movie of the year contender for everyone else
Dec 14 2023,positive,unthinkable amazing impactful
Dec 14 2023,positive,probably the best rendition of godzilla he was mean very well filmed you have to fight through the over acting otherwise this would have been a solid 5 star movie
Dec 14 2023,positive,best godzilla movie i have seen the connection to the characters is very good they actually have meaning godzillas atomic breath is jaw dropping so much emotions of anger and sadness bravo also the guy and girl shouldnt have lived lol
Dec 14 2023,positive,this godzilla movie will shock you on how good it is  if you see one godzilla movie in your lifetime make it this one
Dec 14 2023,positive,an absolute triumph and a breath of fresh air great nod to the original godzilla with sets atmosphere and the music havent felt this good about a movie since lord of the rings the fellowship
Dec 14 2023,positive,a return to godzillas roots in message music and awe this will be remembered as one of the greatest godzilla movies for years to come
Dec 14 2023,positive,best movie of the year
Dec 14 2023,positive,best godzilla movie in a long time
Dec 14 2023,positive,its all an extended metphor for surviver guilt ima cry
Dec 14 2023,positive,a phenomenal film both in spectacle and in character development and performance  this movie is an absolute mustsee
Dec 14 2023,positive,i wish i hadnt heard plot descriptions from film critics they should just avoid plot summaries cause it would have been better going into this completely cold still its a very good movie possibly top 3 of the year
Dec 14 2023,negative,i dont know why people are hyping this movie so much the emotional aspect of this movie is important but its nothing special if a covers themes that are important and sensitive it does not make it automatically a great movie i think the emotions in the movie were animated and not always believable and also there were lots of plot holes in the entire movie that made it less enjoyable for me a typical cliche ending where the protagonist and all the main characters stay alive and well no matter of the odds  another problem is how easy it is to know exactly what is going to happen in the next scene no suspense and no surprises very disappointing
Dec 14 2023,positive,with a heart as big as its kaiju this new entry into the godzilla series breaks all conventions and defines amazing standards for a new era of tohos original monster while staying true to the series origins though here you connect with the characters in less than 2 hours to the point of tears both happy and sad not to mention a wicked g design that perfectly blends old with new heres to 70 more years of godzilla  minus color proves that this is not only a landmark monster film but also a true emotional rollercoaster when the shades change
Dec 14 2023,positive,this movie is absolutely incredible especially with the budget that they had this movie puts modern hollywood to shame and is a must watch for any casual moviegoer
Dec 14 2023,positive,while the themes are a bit hamfisted they are still compelling and nothing overstays int welcome it is a well balanced and honed film the cinematography sfx cgi and sound are all done brilliantly and confidently doest make this city destroying threat feel too big to overwhelm an intimate film about ptsd survivors guilt and community even if its a bit shallow the heart is still there and you can tell the filmmakers had just as much fun making the film as you will have watching it horrifying kaiju and all
Dec 14 2023,positive,i really enjoyed that its only the second non english lang godzilla film ive seen and and i want to see more now
Dec 14 2023,positive,the movie was soo good  this is the first movie a written a review of that i like and love the movie is amazing the acting is great  definitely one of my favorite movies
Dec 14 2023,positive,loved everything about it classic godzilla movie at its finest
Dec 14 2023,positive,you must read subtitles in this one  the scenes with godzilla was very well done as well as the destruction  the story does have emotion and it really hits depending on your sensitivity
Dec 14 2023,positive,this was a major sleeper hit a great callback to the old school but with a quality drama among the humans best ive seen in theaters in some time
Dec 14 2023,positive,most monster movies lack plot  not interesting  godzilla minus one had a plot  followed peoples lives and touched your emotions
Dec 14 2023,positive,a godzilla movie with godzilla front and center but with great acting and a excellent human storyline
Dec 14 2023,positive,the king of kaijins strikes back oh my amazing
Dec 14 2023,positive,one of the best godzilla films ever

Dec 14 2023,positive,great story character build complex storylines  and great balance of excitement and empathy
Dec 14 2023,positive,to keep it short i was pleasantly surprised with this film ive only ever seen maybe four other godzilla movies before seeing this one and i was blown away the lighting and visuals are gorgeous the story is engaging and i found myself liking every single character we were introduced to  the character development is wonderful this is more than just a monster movie this is a tale about the human struggle with ptsd and how it affects not only the life of the inflicted but of all those around them as well
Dec 13 2023,positive,hands down the best godzilla movie do yourself a favor and go watch this flick
Dec 13 2023,positive,a must see this is definitely the best movie ive seen this year and the movie had less then 15 million dollar budget and puts marvel and others with over 200 million dollar budget to shame this movie has everything you need in a movie drama action suspense and a great human story please do yourself a favor and go watch this movie you wont be disappointed
Dec 13 2023,positive,the best godzilla i have seen since the first one
Dec 13 2023,positive,just absolute jewel of a film entertaining
Dec 13 2023,positive,ive been a fan of godzilla since i was a child this is legitimately one of the best if not the best godzilla movie ive ever seen one of the few times in a godzilla movie where i care about the characters and wanted to spend time with them everytime godzilla was on screen i was at the end of my seat because the tension with these characters we cared about was so palpable i love this movie and i hope people watch this in theaters
Dec 13 2023,positive,every aspect of filmmaking and storytelling at its best
Dec 13 2023,positive,the first godzilla set the standard and minus one is essentially a remake of the original most remakes dont hold a candle to the original but this movie improves every plot hole and actually delivers on the terror that the original intended but couldnt quite reach because of special effects limitations when it was made in 1954 it also delivers more emotional impact from the characters and storyline and godzilla is in the film at a higher percentage of playtime than the original i imagine eiji tsuburaya is beaming with joy from the other side at how they brought his original vision to life like he intended it to be best godzilla movie and design to date
Dec 13 2023,positive,in this cinematic masterpiece humans take center stage with godzilla serving as a captivating accent the profound survivor guilt experienced by the protagonist is truly moving this rendition of godzilla is a force to be reckoned withpowerful and terrifying the destruction of ginza is nothing short of nightmare fuel in essence dont miss out on what can be hailed as the most meaningful godzilla film ever crafted
Dec 13 2023,positive,amazing character development musical score was immersive cgi was incredible story was captivating this is how you make a movie
Dec 13 2023,positive,this film was so good compelling characters heartwarming storing lines really thoughtful shorting editing and music one of the best films ive ever seen
Dec 13 2023,positive,certified instant classic emotional epic effects that put american films to shame
Dec 13 2023,positive,the movie was absolutely amazing ive always loved godzilla and they freaking killed it on this one i havent been to the movie theaters in years and this was the first i saw and was blown away highly recommend this movie 1010
Dec 13 2023,positive,i like how intense it is how cinematic it is i also like how epic it is its a great movie
Dec 13 2023,positive,with a perfect balance of epic destruction and compelling human drama godzilla minus one is superior to anything hollywood could produce this year as it works as a creature feature war drama and disaster movie go to see this movie its raw emotional undertones will rock your world and its beautiful message of the value of life will have you on the verge of tears
Dec 13 2023,positive,not to ostracize those who dont like this movie  but you have to be a troll poorly traveled or just not very smart to not be able to recognize how good this japanese film is  you will have to read the horror but the japanese dialogue and inflection is important to the emotion of the movie  its an challenging film about survival duty and loss with a big lizard  the sound is brilliant as well as the silence when needed  what they did with less than 15 million is unreal  this should serve as a wake up call to hollywood  we dont need your bloated expensive product anymore with poorly written characters no one cares about  how can han solo die and you dont care  answer the writing is just that bad they should have stayed on strike  foreign films are up to the challenge of entertaining us and not lecturing us about how bad we are as people
Dec 13 2023,positive,with a less than 15mil budget haunting music and showing of the harsh realities of war this movie surpasses most of not all hollywood produced movies this year definitely worth the watch
Dec 13 2023,positive,this was the best godzilla movie i have seen it was so well done it barely needed to even have godzilla so the scenes where he shows up is just an added bonus
Dec 13 2023,positive,probably the best godzilla movie ive ever seen loved the story line the perspective from the japanese viewpoint of the war and life after
Dec 13 2023,negative,terrible not interesting at all subtitles are terrible
Dec 13 2023,positive,absolute masterpiece left the cinema shaking my head moved and in disbelief at how good it was score was absolutely spot on understated at the right points and high impact when it was demanded i want to see it again and again
Dec 13 2023,positive,great heartfelt moving story awesome score and fx best godzilla movie
Dec 13 2023,positive,this was honestly the best film of the year simply breathtaking story telling and just a completely authentic spin on the godzilla story through the lens of japanese civilians brought me to tears had the feel of the original jaws movie
Dec 13 2023,positive,an actual godzilla movie made me cry and had my jaw dropped the entire time this is what i mean when i tell people im a huge fan of the godzilla franchise not the vs kong bs thats a good movie just not true gman go watch it
Dec 13 2023,positive,great movie best godzilla ever go see it it was so much fun
Dec 13 2023,positive,movie was fantastic
Dec 13 2023,positive,loved the classic godzilla feel
Dec 13 2023,positive,the storytelling is remarkable given that the backbone of it is japan in the immediate wake of world war ii the colors are also beautiful and the acting and lighting is strong a twist at the end is decent too also its impressive how a ship was constructed which really helped paint a portrait of a key aspect of the godzilla character  as good as gareth edwards godzilla film was this one is better
Dec 13 2023,positive,pure cinema and emotions highly recommend that everyone watch this

Dec 13 2023,positive,favorite movie of the year 
Dec 13 2023,positive,absolutely amazing emotional powerful heroic honest courageous and unforgettable immensely better than any hollywood godzilla films
Dec 13 2023,positive,one of if not the best godzilla movies ever put out the monster action is fun but the human story is really gripping and emotional
Dec 13 2023,positive,it was pretty good the story was decent and godzilla looked really good most of the time it paid homage to the original film if youre a godzilla fan id definitely see it
Dec 13 2023,positive,absolutely one of the best movies to have come out this year  in terms of monster movies one of the freshest in a long series of action packed campiness that has come out in the recent years the human characters were believable and i could feel their pain and trauma laid out in a way that wasnt forced especially in the time this takes place in godzilla himself was utterly terrifying despite being a tad smaller than his american counterpart  bang on job toho    55 would and will see again
Dec 13 2023,positive,they made a godzilla movie where i care about the human characters thats crazy
Dec 13 2023,positive,im a big godzilla fan so i didnt know what to expect going in i can be a bit fussy   but this caught me completely off guard even if this didnt have godzilla in it the story and characters were so engrossing i was lost in their story and moved by their plight   but when godzilla does show up hes terrifying and menacing   this needs to be seen on a big screen with surround sound just incredible
Dec 13 2023,positive,pure nostalgic fun subtitles very easy to follow exremely well done like good ol monster movies used to be
Dec 13 2023,positive,so fucking good this movie made me a fan of godzilla

Dec 13 2023,positive,to beat out all the movie houses with a subtitle movie should be a disgrace this movie was one of the best for 2023
Dec 13 2023,positive,best godzilla move ive seen actual storyline between the humans in the story effects look great super original take on a classic story hoping there may be another one down the road
Dec 13 2023,positive,one of the best  of 2023 scary poignant thrilling
Dec 13 2023,positive,an amazing godzilla movie where in the legendary pictures godzillaverse the titans are cool to watch the people always feel like theyre in the way meanwhile in this movie both godzilla and the human element are amazing you get sucked into the main characters story

Dec 13 2023,positive,such a great godzilla movie as a fan of all the original movies and the newer movies godzilla minus one stands apart as a new retelling of the original 1954 godzilla
Dec 13 2023,positive,the movie was amazing i would definitely go see it again ps if you have a dbox theatre near you go see this movie in dbox makes it feel more real
Dec 13 2023,positive,amazing best movie ive seen in a long time the tension the plot build the drama all building a highly enticing and entertaining storyline
Dec 13 2023,positive,this is a classic in the making this is cinema at its best this is godzilllaaaaaa
Dec 13 2023,positive,a towering creative achievement on the level of jurassic park 1993 or raiders of the lost ark 1981 all on a budget of 15m straight out of japan best movie of 2023
Dec 13 2023,positive,its was a great movie
Dec 13 2023,positive,best gojira ever involving characters poignancy subtext and surtext on the mistake of the war great use of faded color for a period feel with 21st c special effects
Dec 13 2023,positive,great throwback to what a godzilla movie was all about while also providing a small glimpse at the aftermath of war
Dec 13 2023,positive,super exciting checks all the boxes for a godzilla bonanza and goes above and beyond with an emotional ptsd survival story
Dec 13 2023,positive,this movie was absolutely epic they did an amazing job with this film
Dec 13 2023,positive,one of the best godzilla movies the people in this movie make you care for them and what happens to them if you dont get a little tearyeyed at the end you must have a cold heart
Dec 12 2023,positive,wow this movie is really amazing all the actors were perfect for their role and godzilla was really something that i didnt expect to see
Dec 12 2023,positive,my favorite film of 2023 it has everything i wanted as a fan of the genre but strong characters and thebes
Dec 12 2023,positive,this movie was devastatingly beautiful  i cried so much  i cared for the humans and the country  godzilla was scary in this film  this movie has the best atomic breath scene i have ever seen in a godzilla film  brilliant masterpiece
Dec 12 2023,positive,awesome took the wife since she did not grow up with godzilla much she loved it and so did i
Dec 12 2023,positive,this godzilla is scary  its not a modern day godzilla movie no one is looking to get close to this guy theyre fighting for their lives from the start its got well paced action suspense a good story line with a touch of love and a terrifying godzilla it takes place near the end of wwii in japan and follows the story of a disgraced kamikaze pilot oh how i loved the pilots story the movie is in japanese with subtitles my husband said he hardly noticed and i agree but i am partial to subtitles i am not a godzilla expert but i enjoy good movies and this was a fun one to watch
Dec 12 2023,positive,lotta action good story along with the godzilla focus it wont win an oscar but overall fun movie
Dec 12 2023,positive,visually superb with solid performances all around great fun and a great 70 year tribute
Dec 12 2023,positive,best of the godzilla movies gives me everything ioved about the original films with modern day effects really enjoyed how the wove the story in this prequel and the characters were compelling as well well done
Dec 12 2023,positive,happy to say it was the best film i have seen this year
Dec 12 2023,positive,the human drama makes it feel like a spielberg film one of his earlier better works but the raging kaiju that is loosed upon an already devastated tokyo is pure unadulterated godzilla
Dec 12 2023,positive,it has been a while to be entertained with a genuine storygm1 did that in spades    there was a general theme throughout the film but it wasnt done with such heavy handedness there was a slow start build up and then came  the outstanding pay off     i wholeheartedly recommend to everyone to see the movie yourself and make your own judgement on the merits presented    godzilla has been reborn
Dec 12 2023,positive,originally posted on letterboxd this is my third time watching this film and i i think this has literally become my favorite movie of all time    i love everything about this film how traditional it is in story telling    the elements of the films characters work so well    noriko as this element of balance and happiness within koichis life mr nobu as the wisely veteraned exmilitary specialist and the doc and kid as the kindly side characters one representing the old generation and the other kid representing the new generation both treated with respect    when godzilla arrives to threaten these characters you feel the weight of their terror largely thanks to director takashi yamazaki who wrote directed and led the vfx for the movie his incredible character writing is what elevates this film from being a good one to being a great one    this film isnt just good godzilla action this is just good storytelling    im about to dive into spoilers so fair warning    when noriko presumably dies everyone feels the weight of her death she wasnt just a throw away character i the plot you actually feel the weight of her death because the characters feel it and through the characters emotions koichi especially you can feel the air in the room be lost    this personalizes the fight between godzilla and koichi shikishima and what makes it so impactful hes not just fighting to redeem himself anymore hes fighting to protect what he still has left and hes even prepared to die for it    very heavy stuff    the ending of the film being happy and noriko turning out to be okay doesnt undo any of that and the way godzilla is defeated is both thematically satisfying and a book end to the story    hear me when i say that the battle between koichi shikishima and godzilla will go down in history as one of if not the most iconic moment in a godzilla film a david and goliath moment to inspire future generations    at the end of the day this film is absolutely worth your time and everyone who has seen it like you will all agree this is not just one of the best godzilla films ever made but one of the best kaiju films ever made and makes me hopeful for the future of cinema
Dec 12 2023,positive,great godzilla movie other than the monsters movement seeming a little robotic at times it was awesome
Dec 12 2023,positive,now thats what i call a cinematic masterpiece
Dec 12 2023,positive,watched the movie twice now and was just as amazed the second time
Dec 12 2023,positive,after visiting japan this year seeing the hiroshima memorial museum  watching oppenheimer it really puts things into perspective especially after watching godzilla very well done movie its underrated and it did so well aesthetically while being on a budget it was very entertaining and i had no idea how it was going to end cant wait for g minus 2 is that the next title lol
Dec 12 2023,positive,this is finally the godzilla film id been hoping for after so many others had at best fallen short of what i felt was the proper treatment for this franchise or at worst missed the mark completely it strikes the difficult balance of achieving a competently compelling human plot and characters while still delivering on the high intensity action and spectacle that audiences crave from the genre     the use of godzilla as an allegory for the inescapable trauma and ptsd that completely engulfed the japanese population post wwii was perfectly woven in and in my opinion paid true homage to the very real human psychological origin and idea behind the creation of the monster itself     the cinematography and cgi work was very tastefully done and had far better visual impact onscreen than many other recent more heavily funded offerings in the genre proving that a budget is not necessarily a barrier to a true quality product for audiences    proving that its indeed very possible to make a seemingly one dimensional franchise break out of previous limitations i was overall refreshed and entertained by this entry and hope to see more from the director and studios responsible definitely a worthy offering that stands in contrast to todays current often abysmal menu of theatrical release fare
Dec 12 2023,positive,great movie it really showcases the heartfelt emotions and humanity of the characters in a way that i have rarely seen in any other kind of monster movie well done
Dec 12 2023,positive,the story brought me to tears unlike other monster movies this one takes time to focus on the value of life this is now one of my favorite movies
Dec 12 2023,positive,stunning film a breath of fresh air hollywood needs to hire directors like this so we can get more amazing films with great plots and characters perfect score
Dec 12 2023,positive,finaly past 16 years
Dec 12 2023,positive,i am a lifetime godzilla fan i have seen every godzilla movie ever made several times my favorite g movie has always been the original 1954 gojira which like minus one is in japanese with english subtitles    minus one may be not only the best ever godzilla movie but also one of the best movies for 2023 the character development is excellent and you really care about their postwar struggles to rebuild a normal life godzilla himself is stunningly terrifying in a way not presented since 1954 all i can say is wow this is a mustsee even if you are not a godzilla fan
Dec 12 2023,positive,an extremely wellmade and entertaining film that focuses on the characters emotion and story rather than repetitive man in suit stomps through a set of miniatures action godzilla is a literal force of nature here this is one that must be seen on the big screen for the most impact
Dec 12 2023,positive,from the plot to the actors special fx and score this makes for an almost perfect godzilla movie
Dec 12 2023,positive,honestly this is the godzilla film to see terrifying dramatic jaw dropping emotional heartfelt and more
Dec 12 2023,positive,i went in with no expectations oh boy they have made this a moving real love story  redemption the movie is a love letter to the original godzilla movies  when godzilla makes land it is something that left the entire cinema speechless as their animation goes buck wild  it is visceral from start to finish i was invested in to the storyline  in the sad points  you feel for their plight etc this was a belter  one which i will be what they do for the next instalment
Dec 12 2023,positive,this is the best movie of 2023 second place isnt even close the cg is wonky but good enough but the story is what matters here how the people deal with this monster is epic this movie is about the people not the monster and even though the monster is in the majority of the movie the story of the people still shines through its an amazing achievement absolutely fantastic
Dec 12 2023,positive,awesome nuclear lizard smashes japan and the people have to come together to take it down great human drama amongst the monster mayhem
Dec 12 2023,positive,ive seen every godzilla movie made and this one is the best so far  so much better than the current american godzilla movies hollywood should be embarrassed
Dec 12 2023,positive,amazing gripping tale of found family not really a godzilla fan either but this iteration of the king of the monsters was honestly the best version ive been exposed to the film does such a amazing job in highlighting the human cast and root for them rather thsn the tyrant lizard best movie ive seen all year a definite mustwatch
Dec 12 2023,positive,that movie was absolutely fantastic best godzilla film since the original
Dec 12 2023,negative,i am at a loss as to understand why it has got so many fantastic reviews from amature and professional critics alike  it is total rubbish from the monster whos eyes are like glazed wallnuts that refuse to move at all the rediculous anamtronic walk to the terrible acting or should that be overacting skills of the entire cast   do any of them have any idea of realistic emotional content scream laugh cry speak softly shudder sneer slap hug ridicule console all in one a line sentence  i also dont understand why some of the cgi is pretty good and then in the next scene it is almost none existent did they run out of money or skill in this department   please please go and see this just to experience how bad it really is
Dec 12 2023,positive,great storytelling up and down emotionally with excellent ending godzilla effects were superb
Dec 12 2023,positive,fantastic visuals great acting great pacing slow enough to develop the characters but never to the point of being boring
Dec 12 2023,positive,absolutely loved this it was refreshing to see godzilla go back to the ww2 roots and have characters that the audience cares about
Dec 12 2023,positive,greatest godzilla film of all time no doubt emotional amd had me on the edge of my seat
Dec 12 2023,positive,despite the loud ass bass coming from the beyonce movie i was still able to be reengaged with the film from the pure perfect acting spectacles and writing this movie is one of the best films of the year and im dying to see it again
Dec 12 2023,positive,hands down the best movie of 2023 and i cant think of a movie ive seen in the last 2 or 3 years that comes remotely close
Dec 12 2023,positive,excellent blend of real characters with engaging arcs and total classic kaiju destruction not just a good godzilla film but a good film period
Dec 12 2023,positive,went in thinking i was going to watch a smash up action monster movie left with puffy eyes and a smile on my face must watch cinema

Dec 12 2023,positive,first godzilla movie that made me tear up the families story is tragic and heartwarming godzilla has never been so scary those eyes
Dec 12 2023,negative,aggressively mediocre maybe i was expecting to much based on the high audience and critics reviews both the acting and the music seemed overwrought on top of that it was about a half hour to long it was extremely boring my wife slept for an hour if you need a two hour nap this is the place
Dec 12 2023,positive,this movie had me on the edge of my seat near the middle and end i highly recommend watching this they had the original godzilla music which gave me chills one of the best godzilla iterations ive ever seen 1010
Dec 12 2023,positive,awesome story and godzilla was bad ass
Dec 12 2023,positive,nostalgic feel but also modern at the same time
Dec 12 2023,positive,its looks like godzilla compare to the other resent movies and the old sound track is back
Dec 12 2023,positive,when you compare this movie to previous other godzilla movies this one has surprised me you actually have a story you care about the characters and supporting cast godzilla is a villain and you are rooting for the humans this film goes back to its roots with a budget of around 15 million with the visual effects acting and story this movie deserves all the praise support and attention definitely a 10010 a godzilla film that will be remembered for ages what a time it is to be a godzilla fan
Dec 12 2023,positive,an original remake that exceeded my expectations really good
Dec 12 2023,positive,this movie is way better than it has any right to be  this is the titanic of monster movies
Dec 12 2023,positive,incredible the best storycharacter driven godzilla movie in years breathtaking shots and thrilling music this movie brought me to tears 1010
Dec 12 2023,positive,great human story with dazzling godzilla mayhem
Dec 12 2023,negative,worst movie in the world
Dec 12 2023,positive,a must go see in the movie theater godzilla taking out its revenge on the humankind that created it you see a strong heartfelt redemption story as well you will be rooting for the characters all the way till the end
Dec 12 2023,positive,no americans to mess it up pure japanese godzilla great sound and visuals and enough humanity toakeyou tearyeyed
Dec 12 2023,positive,what a flick great godzilla great effects characters you care about just great
Dec 12 2023,positive,this was the best film i have seen in 2023 this is not simply a great godzilla movie but rather a great movie that happens to be a godzilla movie the writing was tight it was brilliantly acted a classic redemption story and very much a tear jerker for unexpected but all the right reasons parents take your kids to this movie this film perfectly and overtly reflects the values of heroism stead fastness overcoming incredible adversity and the power of the common man  bring the wife or girlfriend as the love story included within is hard to beat there is no where to find fault in this movieand thats rare  just a real triumph hollywood you need to take heed and gain the lessons spelled out by this movie that cost a paltry 15 million  to makebut has the production value of any film made for 10 times that  i am sooooo glad i made an effort to see this film on the big screen and its goes without saying that this film will find its way into the lionheart movie collection   whether or not you are a fan of godzilla go out and see this film while you still can in a movie theater you will thank me or kick yourself for missing out
Dec 12 2023,positive,very good movie but this was an evil godzilla he wasnt helping japan but rather destroying it still would recommend it if you are a godzilla fan
Dec 12 2023,positive,amazing  best godzilla movie ever  love the japanese filmmaking 
Dec 12 2023,positive,i havent been this invested in a movie since end game it was amazing the characters the growth redemption and monster destruction was a go see it
Dec 12 2023,positive,perhaps the best godzilla to date some sappiness but overall very good
Dec 11 2023,neutral,theres reasons to like this throwback theyre pretentious reasons but reasons nonetheless much like this version of godzilla gmo is a slow lumbering sleepwalking slog
Dec 11 2023,positive,really enjoyed the story and action scenes if you dont cry at least once in this movie youre the real monster here not godzilla
Dec 11 2023,positive,so managed to catch an early screening of this film and while im a big fan of the toho godzilla films i surprisingly preferred the legendary godzilla movies but that my opinion and not what were talking about minus one blow my mind its feels like a true  reimagining of the original film godzilla is great in every scene the cgi had an amazing realism that is lost in modern cinema the best part wasnt even godzilla it was the people the story pacing was great even though it slowed near the end for sec over all my favourite godzilla movie and possibly favourite movie of all time  i cant recommend this any more a must see movie
Dec 11 2023,positive,i took my son to see this movie and honestly didnt know anything at all about it other than that it is a godzilla movie i was expecting a fairly mindless monster movie and was totally blown away by what this movie actually is the original godzilla movie interwove themes of the anxiety that japanese people felt over their defeat in wwii the fact that they were the only people to ever suffer an attack by an atomic weapon and the betrayal many people felt they had suffered at the hands of japanese leadership this movie forefronts all of that going back to what godzilla originally was godzilla the monster is central to the story as an implacable and allbut unstoppable force but the centerpiece is a very beautiful and occasionally sad human story for the first time in a long time godzilla the kaiju is actually scary the people seem very human and the story is absorbing
Dec 11 2023,positive,a triumph incredible vfx the movie itself is stunning to view the japanese subtitles dont matter you still get emotionally attached to these characters and root for them towards the end gojira is a coldblooded monster in this one he destroys without remorse it was a joy to watch this film the first movie i really enjoyed and cried for in years give it a chance youll like it
Dec 11 2023,positive,an engaging storyline in relation to the franchise greatly cinematic and a lot of throwbacks to the 60s godzilla movies i grew up with great soundtrack as well incorporating the traditional themes in a symphonic score we saw it in 4d amazing
Dec 11 2023,positive,thrilling moments of chaos and disaster set on the backdrop of a very heartfelt human story
Dec 11 2023,positive,great plot and an incredible godzilla
Dec 11 2023,positive,probably the best godzilla ive ever seen
Dec 11 2023,positive,godzilla minus one wastes no time jumping straight into the action and effectively showing the aftermath of war and its destruction everytime godzilla is on the screen you cant help but feel an awe of amazement and terror the human characters are fantastically written and the action sequences are outstanding this all adds upto one of the best films of the year
Dec 11 2023,positive,amazing movie  this is more than just a godzilla movie its really about the characters you really can feel the emotion and intensity of this film watch it with my wife and she is no godzilla fan but loved the move and thought it was the best of 2023 i truly agree  with her watch it you wont regret it
Dec 11 2023,positive,godzilla minus one  plus two subtract a fraction of eight    rating a    so anyway i kinda got on a bit of a japanese kick lately because i knew this new godzilla movie was coming out and i thought i never saw that last one toho made shin godzilla i suppose i should look that up it was only available on crunchyroll an anime streaming service for nerds im certainly not a nerd but they had a free one week trial  one week was plenty of time to watch just one godzilla movie and then cancel the anime channel no need to waste any more time there im not one of those weird anime people    after i finished shin godzilla i was like well ive still got like a week anyway maybe ill try some of these weirdo shows with talking bananas and purple hair just to see and then ill cancel it by the end of the week trial i had watched all kinds of random things from chainsaw man to sgt frog along with the oddly named that one time i got reincarnated as a slime and my favorite my hero academia i was literally in the middle of episode 36 when the trial went out and i was yelling at the tv to let me watch more of this asian crack  it didnt listen  it chided me  like that time at panda express when i asked for a large cup of orange sauce to go    so aside from now contemplating my hair color and life choices i watched shin godzilla from 2016  it was terrible  id rate it a d  the online description literally says in the film politicians struggle with bureaucratic red tape in order to deal with the sudden appearance of a giant monster that evolves whenever it is attacked     are you serious politicians struggle with bureaucratic red tape a godzilla film thats your opening statement  i dont know what they were thinking who wants to watch politicians do anything unless its slowly melting terminator 2 style into a lake of lava that film felt like they had to make it or theyd lose their rights to godzilla like foxs last fantastic four movie  a description for a godzilla film should be like in ancient shogun japan three wartorn ronin samurai seek revenge against the newly summoned demon beast godzilla who ravaged their master and village make him only like 30 feet tall and have all kinds of oni and supernatural things it shouldnt be godzilla is sued by the people of tokyo in this four hour courtroom drama although a godzilla courtroom drama does sound kinda cool now that i think about it  godzilla is up on the stand and the district attorney is grilling him over property damage and godzilla panics and eats him  then thats another charge against him so he charges up his bluegammablast and the judge tells him hes overruled  this just writes itself    so because of the horrible shin godzilla i was a bit hesitant to head out to godzilla minus one but i was bored and wanted to go to the theater and i have an unlimited pass and so i did  i was very glad i did  i enjoyed it a lot  for this 38th godzilla film they decided to go back to its roots  its set in the late 1940s just after wwii  its about a kamikaze pilot who ran from his duty  he battles his own demons as a result of this choice and has to find his way back to honor  this is the focus of the film  so you may be saying but i thought it was a godzilla film  i thought you mocked the other one for being about politicians  sure but this one made it interesting it was much more personal and a redemption story of a coward pilot is much better than twenty politicians debating whether to setup a special committee to investigate a possible monster attack  this was a character study with godzilla representing inner demons of humiliation and dishonor it worked for me  if they made a godzilla movie about me the beast would represent the regret of eating at taco bell for a month straight and what i did to my master bathroom    that said it wont work for everyone  it is japanese made not american made  it is all in japanese with english subtitles  it only had a 15 million budget  it is a period drama  it harkens back to the original 1954 godzilla film  if you are just looking for a big lizard kicking over skyscrapers this isnt the movie for you youre probably looking for godlizzo if you want a cool japanese film with a more deeply felt character arc that happens to be set around a big lizard destroying tokyo and the pacific then this is the film for you    i would recommend seeing it with the proper expectations in place  it was cool to see it on the big screen with godzilla huge and angry  the whole time i was wondering what the japanese people would have thought if this was the film shown in 1954 theaters  it would have been a pretty cool reaction    one of my favorite things was the integration of the original musical score into the godzilla scenes when that kicked in it made my heart smile  it was a fun time at the theater  ive seen around 12 of the 28 godzilla films and this was probably my favorite one
Dec 11 2023,positive,it was really good the meanest and most hateful godzilla ever must see i loved it
Dec 11 2023,positive,a great update from japans toho the original very japanese very restrained campy and respectful overall its a compelling story with just the right amount of monster
Dec 11 2023,positive,excellent movie and story
Dec 11 2023,positive,one of the best movies of the year no joke
Dec 11 2023,positive,best godzilla movie of all time and i have seen 95 of them all   the human element was just done superbly  my compliments to the director
Dec 11 2023,positive,this movie will have you stunned from beginning to end easily one of the best movies ive possibly seen this year wow this is a must watch
Dec 11 2023,positive,looking forward to its release in spain
Dec 11 2023,positive,went to see the movie this last weekend it is absolutely the best japanese godzilla movie i have seen the story carries it the characters are deeply heartfelt and understood it says things about the japanese government during the time of ww2 that i felt were insightful and zilla absolutely ferocious and terrifying i think more than ever before this is of course not hero zilla this is atomic bomb zilla and you feel the tension and you feel the intent and heart of the characters also its a fantastic film
Dec 11 2023,positive,this is probably the best godzilla movie i have ever seen it is what i imagine the original creators would have made if given the technology that we have if you have to have a reason to start watching movies with subtitles this is the reason
Dec 11 2023,positive,a great godzilla film thats always a great postww2 drama emotional and gripping
Dec 11 2023,positive,excellent movie bored of seeing hollywoods version of more talking and less godzilla screentime and most confusing perspective  protoganist version of godzilla this japanese version has good enough screentime for zilla scope for the story and characters and well directed it is worth watching its a simple no fuzz movieactors had a purpose too
Dec 11 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is an incredible movie the story is fantastic the plot the effects and everything its also incredibly realistic looking way better than the new godzilla movie coming out the crazy fact is that godzilla minus one had a budget of 15 million and it still insanely realistic definitely worth watching
Dec 11 2023,positive,godzilla minus one     the hype is everywhere i am a big fan of gojira and his all his incarnations without spoilers lets compare where minus one  borrowed from other blockbusters   jaws   star wars   war of the gargantuas     lots of unfinished business at the end loose ends to tie up what elicited the response of joy from myself was the gojira theme that announced the arrival of the big guy if you listen carefully it pays homage to  mothra     fingers crossed for a part 2
Dec 11 2023,positive,phenomenal loved the movie one of the best godzilla movies ive ever seen
Dec 11 2023,positive,this movie was great stuff  harkens back the original versions themes  the human component is felt  every appearance feels purposeful without being over done  not the over the top action bonanza that the kong crossover is
Dec 11 2023,positive,this is what godzilla truly is
Dec 11 2023,positive,loved the movie everything about it was great the story the design for godzilla wasnt bad honestly he kinda scared me in the beginning
Dec 11 2023,positive,i wish i could give it more stars this movie was absolutely amazing and is the best movie of 2023 this is a must watch like asap the plot and the cinematography was incredible im not over exaggerating go watch now
Dec 11 2023,positive,one of the best films of the year a stunning tale of post war japan with some of the best man vs monster movies ever
Dec 11 2023,positive,must see movie if you are a godzilla fan this was the best godzilla movie i have ever seen its on my top 50 movies of all time
Dec 11 2023,positive,this movie took godzilla back to its roots it was an emotional experience to see godzilla treated so well by the director you also felt as if you could experience the emotions of the human characters truly a brilliant film
Dec 11 2023,positive,i just loved this movie the characters are detailed and truly human godzilla was awesome in every minute
Dec 11 2023,positive,arguable the best godzilla movie ever got so involved in  the movie i forgot i was reading captioning actually had a plot besides the lizard and was fun to watch best creature yet
Dec 11 2023,positive,truly enjoyed this movie  have been a godzilla fan since i was 5  almost 5 decades love the throwback to the seriousness of the original and reclaim that horror feeling when godzilla is on scene unfortunately he is not on as much as would like  almost the hidden easter eggs through out the movie is quite impressive with respect given to past movies    there are a few plot angles that hold me back from giving it 5 stars but in the end it is a godzilla movie after all and one of the best ever produced
Dec 11 2023,positive,the best godzilla movie since the original absolute perfection
Dec 11 2023,positive,a masterful film filled with amazing spectacle high tension thundering action heartfelt emotion and just an incredible story the acting special effects music and directing are top tier making it one of the best entries in this legendary gojira franchise
Dec 11 2023,positive,great movie in general but best monster movie of all time
Dec 11 2023,positive,good movie but the movie drags in a couple of screens
Dec 11 2023,positive,great movie even though it is in all japanese it still has a great plot and emotional storyline
Dec 11 2023,positive,highly recommended the characters are extremely engaging and godzilla returns to form
Dec 11 2023,positive,i was surprised to experience a heavyhitting emotional movie that also includes a monster with an atomic heat ray the focus of the story being immediately during the aftermath of wwii makes for a great origin story of godzilla alongside characters who are dealing with not only their country being destroyed but almost every aspect of their lives needing to be rebuilt theres a lot to unpack and quite a few themes that are tackled in a film where i thought i would just be witnessing a giant lizard monster flipping ships and knocking over buildings     there is a moment where everything goes silent and i cant remember the last time ive been in a crowded theater where it seemed the audience was holding their breath there were times of cheering clapping and im sure some tears being shed what more could you want my only complaint is despite ryunosuke kamiki appearing in a few dozen films but his ability to express realistic crying on screen is nearly nonexistent overall though im quite satisfied and will be enthusiastically recommending this to everyone
Dec 11 2023,positive,a thoroughly enjoyable and interesting character driven story with all the right nods to the classic godzilla basics   interesting how a japanese movie with english subtitles not primarily intended for a us audience made on a shoestring budget is far better than the vast majority of whats coming out of hollywood these days
Dec 11 2023,negative,i have no idea how people can enjoy this movie it was absolutely one of the worst movies i have ever seenmy wife and son all contemplated walking out at several points the actors overactnonstop screaming in simple conversations it is very slowwife fell asleep which is why we didnt leave i have no idea how critics can applaud this filmstrongly disagree no logic to why godzilla attacks and just bad dialogue throughout the film save your money
Dec 11 2023,positive,it has been over a week now that i have seen godzilla minus one and i am still thinking about it easily the best godzilla film ever made and ranks as one of the best disaster films ever made as well the storytelling was just spot on and kept you glued from beginning to end the movie looked amazing and it was on a 15mm budget unbelievable i cannot wait to see it again 
Dec 11 2023,positive,this changed my life
Dec 11 2023,positive,it made me cry it made me stare in awe but especially it made me fear for the future of humanity ive always been a teamgodzilla for the sake of movie pleasure but this time i was teamtokio all the way what a beautiful writing what a great director what a great movie
Dec 11 2023,positive,i grew up in the 80s watching godzilla marathons whenever they came on tv which wasnt often but when they did you can bet i was glued to the tv most godzilla movies were campy made for kids so yeah we didnt care for the plot we just wanted to see giant monsters fighting the first scary godzilla movie that i watched was godzilla 1985 or as it was called in japan the return of godzilla g85 is a direct sequel to the original godzilla from 1954 and ignores all the movies from the 60s and 70s it returned godzilla to its roots where hes more of a force of nature not necessarily a hero or villain so it was a nice change of pace of what i had seen     having seen every godzilla movie from the showa and heisei eras and some from the millenium series i was longing for something more modern not just a man in a rubber suit godzilla 1998 was an utter disappointment so when wblegendary brought us an american godzilla that was closer to the original it was what we wanted growing up an updated godzilla with todays technology yes it was still a bit campy but the monsters looked great we didnt care about the human element we never have    thats what makes tohos godzilla minus one special theyve managed to make an amazing godzilla movie where we actually care about the humans were rooting for them all and dont want them to get killed by godzilla this movie will get you emotional im not crying you are the visuals the sounds and if you watch it in 4d oof even better ive watched it twice already and cant wait for it to be released digitally might even buy the dvdbluray whenever its released
Dec 11 2023,positive,this movie was fantastic the feel and vibe of the movie reminded me of my childhood while growing up watching godzilla movies  10 out of 10 highly recommend
Dec 11 2023,positive,must watch in 4d  feels like godzilla the ride worth it
Dec 11 2023,positive,an emotional tale of grief loss grit love and resolve set in post ww2 japan oh yeah it also has godzilla in it this movie rules
Dec 11 2023,positive,the human characters are actually engaging for once and godzilla himself is incredible
Dec 11 2023,positive,this is the godzilla movie many have been waiting and wishing for it forsakes the hollywood depiction of a saviour and goes allin on its traditional japanese roots of godzilla as an unstoppable force of nature given the budget usd15mil it is certainly amazing what the production company managed to pull off with both visual and practical effects godzilla looks a little janky at times  but it is by no means terrible   and the heatatomic breath this movie nailed it  if youre happy with reading subtitles or can speak japanese then i cant recommend this movie enough   i only hope modern hollywood takes a page out of this book on how to write a compelling story with interesting characters
Dec 11 2023,positive,i grew up with godzilla my dad putting the movie monster on our tv for family movie nights are memories ill cherish my appreciation for the monster only grew as a learned more about the backstory and why the original film was made i was so excited to see this film and brought a group with me some who have never seen a godzilla movie before and some who grew up with the monster like myself as i watched i looked at my friends faces they were all the same shocked and on the edge of the seats as they watched hands over their mouths as godzilla charges his atomic breath this movie is for everyone and a big win for fans who have been here from the start the film creates new fans and is a masterpiece to us gfans absolutely incredible 1010
Dec 11 2023,positive,this is a great reboot of the original godzilla  would recommend to any who like monster movies
Dec 11 2023,positive,the entire movie was  an homage to the original  godzilla with a fantastic update
Dec 11 2023,positive,how often do you watch a movie and it becomes an instant classic ive been a fan of godzilla for most my life introduced to the series by my dad godzilla has always been a series filled with campe fun monster fights and terrible human plots in a way that was the godzilla experience an uncut gem that was special but never succeeded at holding a narrative even the best movies in the series never rising above mediocre in story telling    but godzilla minus one it is the culmination of the entire godzilla franchise as if we had only been experiencing the prototypes of the truly worthy creation since 1954 godzilla minus one is the godzilla movie accept no american substitutions takashi yamazaki has bridged the gap that godzilla has been lacking for so long a delivered a truly wonderful story to go along with worlds favorite giant monster    i could not stress enough just how moving of a narrative it is and how unexpected and delighted i was watching it of the nearly 20 godzilla movies ive watched godzilla minus one is the only one that made me cry i realized in the theater that i wasnt just having a good time i wasnt just getting a thrill but i was truly moved by a godzilla movie that i wasnt putting up with the human plot to get to godzilla for once    if you havent yet go watch this movie i havent touched on the cinematography or the acting or music etc but it is easily some of the best in the franchise the sound design in particular is truly to be commended     takashi yamazaki is writer and director to a truly legendary film in godzilla minus one i am incredibly thankful to him and the many other that came together to make this movie my favorite godzilla movie and a truly great film
Dec 11 2023,positive,emotional action packed exactly what i anticipate from a great godzilla flick  if youre a fan of japanese kaiju films this one is a definite must see
Dec 11 2023,positive,the first godzilla movie where godzilla is secondary to the human story best film i have scene this year
Dec 11 2023,positive,by far one of the best movies ive seen in a long time so refreshing great story great writing great character development and godzilla was  fantastic in this movie will  be watching it again
Dec 11 2023,positive,fun monster times nice parallel nonmonster story
Dec 11 2023,positive,awesome destruction meanest godzilla ever  japanese heroes bravo toho
Dec 11 2023,positive,its truly incredible what was accomplished with this movie i cannot possibly give it higher praise taking into account the budget its even more amazing but even setting that aside its a monumental achievement in storytelling
Dec 11 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is easily the best movie ive seen this year and the best movie that i have seen  bar top gun maverick  in a very long time i dont have the words to convey how good this movie is or just how it embarrasses hollywood and what they put out but this is easily the best movie that i have seen in a very long while    i cant believe im saying this but this movie has a very real possibility of getting nominated for an oscar
Dec 11 2023,positive,easily the best movie ive seen in 2023  some of the best cgi ive seen yet truly showing just how big and destructive godzilla is  always trust the japanese to get the original kaiju godzilla correct
Dec 11 2023,positive,amazing score amazing acting amazing cinematography just overall amazing

Dec 11 2023,positive,best movie in years wow
Dec 11 2023,positive,i would definitely rewatch this film over and over again
Dec 11 2023,positive,godzilla is back baby ive been a fan of godzilla since i was a kid in the early 2000s and i can say that we havent gotten an exceptional new film since ive been alive looks like thats over now though the story of our boy shikishima the failed kamikaze pilot has to be the best human arc in a godzilla movie yet normally fans complain about the human stories being an annoyance but this time it nearly steals the show this is helped by the interesting setting of a battered japan immediately following their defeat in wwii the gman himself does not disappoint either i especially loved how they made his breath attack feel so powerful walked out of the theater with a big goofy grin on my face and come to find everyone else enjoyed it too hope this kindles new interest in the ip exceptional
Dec 11 2023,positive,thank you for this masterpiece i love godzilla but this movie was on a whole other level its always the governments fighting back which is realistic but i always feel so disconnected from the people but minus one i was so engrossed into the lives of these people first time a godzilla film made me cry but it was so beautifully crafted thank you thank you
Dec 11 2023,positive,went to see this last friday and all i can say is thus movie was absolutely stunning for a 15 million dollar budget they did an amazing job with the effects    the star of the show was the human characters though and the well thought story they did an amazing job telling a story about the horrors of war and showing the struggles of ptsd     really couldnt recommend this film enough
Dec 11 2023,positive,it was as a great story and the cgi was well done
Dec 11 2023,positive,one of the best big g movies ive seen in i dont know how long
Dec 11 2023,positive,really enjoyed this movie  when i was a kid 40 years ago in the summer theyd have a matinee series of which godzilla was always one of the movies and that movie was the one id never miss  this brought back all those nostalgic memories   the godzilla face the music etc  i seldom  clap at the end of movies but this one my 14 year old son and i yes
Dec 11 2023,positive,fantastic movie all around  so refreshing after seeing so many duds this year  dragged my wife to this movie and she ended up loving it as well  this is really a movie you need to see in the theater  i dont think it will hold up well streaming at home
Dec 11 2023,positive,if youre a fan of godzilla or just fun movies this ones a great choice

Dec 11 2023,positive,best godzilla movie ever old school godzilla even with subtitles was easy to watch whole family enjoyed it
Dec 11 2023,positive,ive seen it in color five times now and this was my first time seeing it without color honestly it is a significant improvement that made it feel like a completely different film subtle details became more apparent without color that added more depth and realism to the film as a whole and i came out feeling far more immersed than i did seeing color in 4dx
Dec 11 2023,positive,this is the best godzilla movie ever made easily one of the best films of the year as well the acting the cinematography the effects the emotion such an incredible film cannot recommend this film enough
Dec 11 2023,positive,well written fantastic visual effects i also loved the fact the original theme motif for godzilla was introduced my son loved it and i will probably watch it a second time
Dec 11 2023,positive,great movie with interesting and wellmotivated characters  understandable human story with a strong emotional arc  includes a couple real surprising gotcha moments which ive not experienced in movies for a long time excellent writing  first movie ill probably see more than once in the theatre  strong recommend  go see this movie and support great storytelling
Dec 11 2023,positive,raw emotions insane vfx for the budget and an incredible story i have not been this invested in movie characters since top gun maverick last year will go see it again and highly recommend
Dec 11 2023,positive,good movie   went to go see it with my family and actually went in thinking it wouldnt be as enjoyable as english released movies but it was still well worth it   having to read through the subtitles didnt take away from the experience   it had a well thought out and deep storyline and was very inspiring   very worthwhile even if you are not used to watchin foreign films
Dec 11 2023,positive,movie was amazing usually a fan of just the monster fighting like in the monster verse godzillas but the story in this was amazing loved it cant wait to see the second if they make it
Dec 11 2023,positive,it was so stinking good wow
Dec 11 2023,positive,outstanding delivers as the giant city crunching godzilla ive come to love  wrapped up beautifully with characters whos struggles dont take away but add to the climatic final confrontation brought back the true magic that exist in watching a movie of this caliber on the big screen
Dec 11 2023,positive,at the start it was kinda slow but the rest of the movie it was awesome the human drama was good the special effects goated and of course godzilla himself being iconic and terrifying best movie of godzilla franchise and best movie of 2023
Dec 11 2023,positive,not just the best monster movie ever probably one of the top movies ever period i felt every emotion to its full measure im still buzzing hours after watching
Dec 11 2023,positive,this is how a godzilla movie should be made
Dec 11 2023,positive,this is definitely my new favorite godzilla movie i especially enjoyed the use of the original godzilla movies soundtrack
Dec 11 2023,positive,best modern day version of a godzilla movie in a long time storylines was great
Dec 11 2023,positive,ive never been a huge godzilla fan wow this movie blew me away godzilla is actually scary and inspires dread and the human plot is touching and sad but also gratifying theres some good commentary on ww2 japanese era and their treatment of their soldiers and citizens the backdrop is a recovering japan getting basically nuked again by godzilla and coming together to fight back    simple and very effective godzilla also looked great admittedly at the expense of some other effects in the movie but im very okay with the budget being focused on godzilla and the atomic breath which hits every time definitely give it a watch wether you like godzilla movies or not i guarantee most people will be hooked by it
Dec 11 2023,positive,really a must see if youre a die hard godzilla fan it has amazing action godzilla is a menace and its a full movie that doesnt have any english dialogue in it but it does have subtitles 1010 a must watch
Dec 11 2023,positive,all time classic for 70 years the original has stood as the gold standard that torch has now been passed this is a love letter to the original while also being its own thing anyone who has seen the original will catch a lot of key callbacks this has nothing but respect for it the human characters are the best in any kaiju film ever this feels like speilberg could have directed this no character is a throwaway or just blends in godzilla is terrifying in this the cgi is solid also in this this fixes the only real issue of the original which was it was almost too unrefined and raw for its own good see it
Dec 11 2023,positive,ive never experienced a monster movie that has such impactful characters as with this one of course seeing an epic and destructive godzilla was what i was there for but i didnt expect to love the human characters as much as i did there was so much emotion and depth to the characters that you dont normally get with a monster movie in the end i was rooting for the humans against godzilla that is a win
Dec 11 2023,positive,classic godzilla  is back on the big screen action was on point the human emotion  shown is just not touched by american  movies moving and tear jerkier
Dec 11 2023,positive,a classic good story telling with strong replay value
Dec 11 2023,positive,the atomic bomb memories pure sadness and horror great direction and production simply one of the scariest godzilla movies
Dec 11 2023,positive,maybe ive grown used to immersive games with good plots like the fallout series but i could only give this 35 stars i might be spoiled on movies because of immersive games    the plot was one of disgrace and redemption with a touch of exploration of ptsd so that was nice the special effects were quite good    but to me the ending was predictable and everything worked out in the end you know that sort of thing    on the whole it kept my interest and i wont say the movie was bad but for all the 5 star gushing reviews i guess i expected more    i will say keeping the movie in japanese and subtitling it actually added to the experience it felt far more authentic that way
Dec 11 2023,positive,this is not something i would have seen in the theatres in all likelihood however the reviews for a japanese language godzilla film got me curious this was a fantastic film and not just for a godzilla movie but period i highly recommend just about anyone see this and in a theatre too one of the best if not the best of 2023 for me
Dec 11 2023,positive,a godzilla movie that would be a great movie even if we cut godzilla out of the movie but godzilla still kicks ass when show up
Dec 11 2023,positive,surprisingly good i wasnt expecting to like this movie as much as i did especially considering its in japanese and i had to read subtitles  not that i really mind having to read subtitles but those movies dont tend to make my topmoviesoftheyear list if you know what i mean and really if it wasnt for my 12 year old nephew wanting to see it i probably would have missed it but glad i didnt    ive no doubt that some will complain about the movie being too long or not having enough godzilla action but what really made this one shine for me personally was the time spent on telling a good story and character development i really felt like the characters were the main focus here and godzilla was a secondary focus serving as a way to tell a story about honor and shame and redemption and so much more a great cast a way better than usual script for a godzilla movie beautiful cinematography and good special effects all helped make it work and when we do get to see godzilla wreaking carnage  it has even more impact because of the deep emotional impact we can see he has had on the lives of the characters    small personal quibbles not quite sure why godzilla had to be even fatter than what i used to refer to as the american godzilla from the 1998 film with matthew broderick and i wish he had ate more people instead of just biting them in half  but then he might have been even fatter lol
Dec 11 2023,positive,amazing hollywood needs to take lessons from the japanese on how to make a movie this was tense raw and immersive
Dec 11 2023,positive,my first godzilla movie and it was a master piece 
Dec 11 2023,positive,awesome movie took me back to my childhood because of the type of godzilla he was great story as well definitely worth full price admission

Dec 11 2023,positive,this movie lives up to the word of mouth hype  never thought id ever shed a tear during a godzilla movie  so good and its got giant kiaju
Dec 11 2023,positive,amazing cinematography visual effects emotion story score everything
Dec 11 2023,positive,best godzilla movie ever full stop yes ive seen all of them most multiple times
Dec 11 2023,positive,minus one was the best godzilla movie i have ever seen in theaters i liked the characters the story and godzillas design i will give it five stars
Dec 10 2023,positive,im very impressed with this japanese made film a very good dramatic story taking place along with the king of the monsters attacking this was more intense and showed people getting killed special effects is well done my only complaint is that from waist down he is noticeably bigger godzilla has phat ass the acting is a little over the top but doesnt hurt the film definitely recommend to godzilla and monster fans
Dec 10 2023,positive,prepare to be blown away by this incredible film i too was skeptical when i first booked tickets for godzilla minus one the title alone seemed like a turn off and as someone who isnt a fan of excessive special effects i was hesitant to tell my husband about the movie in fear that he may also be put off by it    but let me tell you this movie surpassed all of my expectations despite its title which may sound unappealing at first glance the reviews raved about its brilliance so with an open mind and high hopes my husband and i sat down to watch    and boy were we blown away the story of japans devastation during world war ii and the terrifying presence of godzilla had us on the edge of our seats but what truly captivated us was the underlying love story and the courageous kamikaze pilot who fears death    this is not your typical monster movie filled with overthetop special effects instead it tastefully combines elements of 1940s nostalgia with 21st century technology to create a truly unique experience the attention to detail and commitment to staying true to the era is commendable and adds an extra layer of realism to the film    i cannot recommend this movie enough its not just a film you watch and forget about its one that stays with you long after the credits roll so dont miss out on this beautiful masterpiece that will leave you in awe hurry and grab your tickets now before theyre sold out
Dec 10 2023,positive,big spoilers honestly i wasnt sure if this movie would be good when i heard it had no dubbing that opinion changed new favorite movie and barely had to focus on the words because the actorsactresses did an amazing and also godzillasaurus i think at the beginning was amazing and the gmans new atomic breath is so cool with the explosion and the cgi is freaking amazing also the human characters usually in the godzilla movies ive watched well uhhh the humans just werent entertaining but this movie that kamikaze plot wad very interesting and godzilla is not like a usual godzilla those punches were insanely fast and the ww2 plot was insane also that remix of the godzilla theme was so good human actors 1010   godzilla 1110  soundtrack 910   plot 1110  overall 985100   my favorite movie ever    beat previous favorite movie jurassic park by a long shot
Dec 10 2023,positive,a perfect godzilla film for everyone it blew me away

Dec 10 2023,positive,a really good story my son and i agreed that the movie being in japanese with subtitles was a great experience  this movie was a a
Dec 10 2023,positive,a film that made use of excellent camera angles and shots to give a great feel of the scenes music was well used to capture the tone that each scene was giving to the audience godzilla truly came off as a terrifying creature that the human protagonists had to find a way to overcome most importantly the human characters had struggles and arcs that i was invested in to seeing through and even got emotional being moved to tears as events transpired i recommend this film not because it is a film with godzilla but a truly excellent film that overall is an incredible package all the way through

Dec 10 2023,positive,probably movie of the year  its not perfect but entertaining  good side story of the character you care a little about  amazing they did this on a 15 million budget  there was homage to the old ways of godzilla
Dec 10 2023,positive,i went in with high expectations after seeing all the reviews they were met
Dec 10 2023,positive,godzilla minus one should sweep the oscars and win the academy award for best picture      yes this is a foreign japanese film with english subtitles but  godzilla minus one is a stunning masterpiece that will leave you breathless if you give it a chance this gripping and heartfelt film takes us back to the aftermath of world war ii where the legendary monster wreaks havoc on a wartorn japan    the films exquisite cinematography captures the raw emotions of the characters and the sheer terror of godzillas presence the special effects are topnotch making the monsters appearance all the more terrifying and aweinspiring    one of the most striking aspects of the film is its exploration of the human condition in the face of overwhelming adversity the characters are complex and relatable and their struggles will resonate with audiences long after the credits roll    in short godzilla minus one is a mustsee film that is a masterclass in stunning visuals powerful storytelling and an unforgettable monster to create a truly unforgettable cinematic experience
Dec 10 2023,positive,possibly the best godzilla movie ever great story with interesting and likable characters
Dec 10 2023,positive,great story with stunning visual effects you dont even notice the subtitles after the first few memories this is a movie you have to see in theaters to fully appreciate
Dec 10 2023,positive,wow been watching godzilla since i was a kid in the 1970s on basic television back in the day i have all the g dudes  dvds from japan and this is the best one yet that makes you think and feel everyones pain   it is great human story that makes you want to buy another ticket and watch it again
Dec 10 2023,positive,the best godzilla movie since the original 1954 version finally a monster movie where the human characters are interesting and not used for exposition the movie shows that you do not need a big budget to make a great film
Dec 10 2023,positive,best godzilla movie iv seen in recent years this movie was just amazing plan and simple the story is well written and godzilla is chilling to watch in the best way the pacing is great and charcuterie development i actually cared about the characters

Dec 10 2023,positive,my favorite film of the year
Dec 10 2023,positive,this movie was a breath of fresh air i love how it remained true to the originals and provided a message for humanity one huge message was how war not only affects veterans but also civilians was extremely powerful i could go on and on about the rollercoaster of emotions but i might reveal spoilers    disney take note this is how to make a movie
Dec 10 2023,positive,ive seen every single godzilla film multiple multiple times and having seen minus one in the theater twice all i can say is wow this film is perfection the acting is immaculate the special effects sequences are stunning that takao battle and the emotions are so real ranks with the original gojira as the finest of the franchise
Dec 10 2023,positive,im lost for words amazing
Dec 10 2023,positive,the most powerful most intimate godzilla movie ever  others are popcorn this was true drama  not for the feint of heart  one family had to leave after the first scene
Dec 10 2023,positive,this film has a great story with great effects for a tiny budget well done there was at least one poorly edited scene at the tail end of the film and a very unnecessary underwater scene which undermines the heros journey and leaves the story open for continuation the film would have worked better as a oneoff film with an completely resolved ending
Dec 10 2023,positive,this is a really good movie and the best use of large scale action ive seen in a long time  way better than marvel other godzilla movies better than apocalypse movies godzilla is 200 feet tall but frightening  devestating on a human level and tightly bound to the inner struggles of the characters  there were times i said oh my god to the devestation or was really moved by the courage struggle or triumph of the characters    the writing  direction is the difference  in many movies of this scale you see cgi robots monsters or indestructible super heroes knocking over cgi skyscrapers from miles away  in this movie the writers put a 200 monster down at the level of people and theres geniune suspense  dread in the action  the shots of huge events like godzillas nuclear breath make you feel like youre inside it instead of 3 miles away       we really enjoyed this movie hopefully marvel  other studios take note and start producing gripping involving action movies that leverage cgi instead of what feels like a series of boring demo reels from computer animation studious
Dec 10 2023,positive,slow at times but this movie gives you the old age godzilla vibes
Dec 10 2023,positive,an interesting take on godzilla minus one  it works better in some scenes and more poorly in others still its an interesting experience
Dec 10 2023,positive,what a great version of a godzilla movie  evan with subtitles i was hooked  i could ramble on a variety of thoughts but better off to say go see it and form your own opinion  cheers

Dec 10 2023,positive,this is film is a must see movie that covers multiple genres from drama to historical to psychological to scifi to war and thats without godzilla enter godzilla and this becomes the greatest godzilla movie of all time     go see this movie
Dec 10 2023,positive,one of the most beautiful cinematographic masterpieces ive ever seen far beyond just a kaiju movie but it delivers true to the original godzilla formula on every front while being interesting fresh and beautiful as a film
Dec 10 2023,positive,this movie was one of the best things ive seen this year i wasnt expecting it to have such a compelling storyline that many other godzilla movies fail to have i was invested the whole way through and the cgi looks great knowing that this was made on only 15 million makes it all the more impressive
Dec 10 2023,positive,the best godzilla movie since 1954 which is a very hard thing for me to say since i do love a lot of godzilla movies absolutely amazing which i think makes this godzilla plus one

Dec 10 2023,positive,good movies need to be exported now lol dont sleep on this one lots of heart action and monster rampage
Dec 10 2023,positive,a beautiful story entwined with the complete and utter devastation of a kaiju attack while having the ending of ww2 be the backdrop looming in the shadows this one felt like the godzilla films of yesteryear and imo is an absolute must watch for fans of the king
Dec 10 2023,positive,this movie is the heart of godzilla story for the budget and what they presented oh my god i was lost in the movie i believe godzilla was real lot of fun great movie for everyone this movie should get lots of awards i really did enjoy this film this is a fun movie for everyone
Dec 10 2023,positive,what genius to set the film in the period immediately after world war ii  the themes of survival perseverance haunting guilt and redemption were incredibly powerful all enhanced by seeing it in  japanese ie undubbed

Dec 10 2023,positive,i have never been a godzilla fan but this movie has turned me into one  amazing storytelling on a shoestring budget  hollywood needs to take notes
Dec 10 2023,positive,i personally believe this is the best godzilla film ever made the characters were so real and believable this was the first kaiju movie that has ever made me care for the human characters it also is an excellent portrayal of postwar japan and the tole on its people
Dec 10 2023,positive,as a lifelong fan of kaiju cinema i can honestly say this is the best film in the franchise amazing characters that you actually care about amazing pacing backdrop and of course godzilla such a threatening presence hes actually scary in this one absolutely worth the price of admission
Dec 10 2023,positive,no words the best godzilla movie ever if you are a godzilla fan you must watch this this has everything
Dec 10 2023,positive,all aroundfantastic 1010
Dec 10 2023,positive,the movie was alright  unfortunately the movie had subtitles which was very irritating but overall 710
Dec 10 2023,positive,this movie is really incredible movie   it was like a very awesome and amazing movie    it is a sirius movie no jokes and no funny moment  this movie like  very tenson full movie i really suggest to watch this movie 
Dec 10 2023,positive,havent seen the original but really enjoyed this movie only gripe was godzillas walk cycle being so slow and robotic like despite that very serious and enjoyable
Dec 10 2023,positive,not only the best movie ive seen in years but also the best godzilla movie ive ever seen movies are not dead hollywood is dead hollywood movies have budgets pushing ever closer to half a billion dollars on a regular basis and have absolutely no meaningful story to tell this movie has absolutely nothing to do with that japan constantly proves to be the modern ruler in meaningful story telling maybe one day hollywood will start taking notes
Dec 10 2023,positive,very good movie awesome directing recreation of 1940s tokyo costumes acting and character development hollywood needs to learn from this film and find their way back to good character development and story telling 5 stars
Dec 10 2023,positive,the story was compelling all of the characters had a role to play and i cared for all of them godzilla was a complete force of nature that was devastating this is a classic already a must watch for fans of kaiju and those who want a heart wrenching story see it in theaters if you can the power of the destruction is insane on the silver screen
Dec 10 2023,positive,granted you pretty much have to be a godzilla fan to go to a godzilla movie but this was a great onereally less about the gman more about postwar japan and the japanese psyche a little corny in places but would definitely see again
Dec 10 2023,positive,absolutely top notch godzilla is horrifying
Dec 10 2023,positive,the movie is visually beautiful  one might even call it spectacular in the way it portrays postwar japan and related naval machinery in its decay and rebirth of tokyo this is not your 1960s campy saturday afternoon matinee portrayal of godzilla movie but instead a dark and thoughprovoking spin on this age old story  the use of akira ifukubes classic godzilla soundtrack in places is a nice touch too and consider staying through the final credits for an auditory omen  
Dec 10 2023,positive,i wouldve loved the film without godzilla
Dec 10 2023,positive,just finished godzilla minus one did not expect to get emotional during a kaiju film yet this is cinematically probably one of the best films ive ever seen 1210 highly recommend to everyone

Dec 10 2023,positive,great movie now non spoiler but its not about godzilla now he does come out but more about a soldier also being tissues and be prepare to cry
Dec 10 2023,positive,this godzilla may not quite match the eye candy and spectacle of other recent godzillas but what it does have is a story actually worth watching

Dec 10 2023,positive,i was truly impressed with this film thanks to careful pacing thoughtful writing and brilliant acting characters feel like real people with genuine emotions rather than archetypes cast to fill a role godzillas face needed some extra care his eyes were always wide open and his mouth had a permanent smile which was distracting at times however thats honestly the only critique i have for this otherwise refreshing film
Dec 10 2023,positive,i am a bit of a militarynaval history nerd and this movie was better than i could have ever hoped the ships that appear in the movie are accurate for the types of ship they are all of the warships are ships that actually survived the war and the named former captain is of one of the warships famed for surviving numerous engagements with littletono damage or casualties  which is thematically appropriate to the end of the movie    besides all that it is emotionally powerful and visually spectacular and i highly recommend it to anyone and everyone

Dec 9 2023,positive,movie did not show enough godzilla for me majority of the movie spent on dialog of family  i was hoping the finale would at least be a long battle showing him at one point he let out  his godzilla scream that was silent
Dec 9 2023,positive,by far the best godzilla film
Dec 9 2023,positive,amazing movie i throughly enjoyed from bringing to end i couldnt have asked for a better movie thank you

Dec 9 2023,positive,enjoyed feeling like you were there with godzilla and the usual excitement when the battles take place
Dec 9 2023,positive,i was hesitant to see this in a theater due to the subtitles im so glad i did as the subtitles didnt distract me at all this has a moving storyline and a wonderful cast of characters that kept me engaged the cinematography is spectacular and the special effects are on point the weaving of the action with the acting is a tribute to the best of what i love about an old movie story telling rarely seen in todays releases i encourage all who enjoy a good storyline to see this movie as it is far more than a godzilla movie its the birth of a new day in the franchise
Dec 9 2023,negative,yothe godzilla effects were out of this world however this movie was utterly trash honestly i dont see how this movie is getting all the good reviews what you get is 40 mins of trash followed by 30 seconds of godzilla followed by another 50 mins of trash followed by 40 seconds of godzilla rinse and repeat     the movie is mainly about some punk ass kamikaze pilot understandably who failed to oconduct his duty in wwii love story included and now seeks redemption by being a kamikaze pilot to kill godzilla he kind of failed at the kamikaze part again    i am a godzilla fan but this mofo put my wife to sleep with me almost right behind her i should have went to see the marvels insteadf this movie

Dec 9 2023,positive,way better then expected
Dec 9 2023,positive,almost certainly movie of the year for the first time in a while the human characters are actually more compelling than the monster and i mean that as a genuine compliment not to sleep on godzilla himself who is as fun as ever must see for sure
Dec 9 2023,positive,not just the best godzilla movie ive ever seen one of the best movies ive ever seen its that good amazing
Dec 9 2023,positive,a cinematic masterpiece thatll go down as probably one of if not the best godzilla movie of all time character development was excellent and storyline was compelling and kept you interested the whole time coming from growing up watching the originally godzilla and current and past movies this is without a doubt in my top 3 if not top legendary and warner brothers take notes on how to make a proper film by watching this
Dec 9 2023,positive,great movie  great storyline
Dec 9 2023,positive,best movie ive seen awhile hands down
Dec 9 2023,positive,im telling you that this movie has earned every bit of praise it is getting  a powerful a human drama not a war movie a wwii story about survival in post apocalyptic japan where their country lost everything and is back to zero  not a monster movie a monster story how the additional devastation from godzilla took japan down another notch from zero to minus one
Dec 9 2023,positive,i have seen all godzilla movies except for some animated ones i saw the american version of godzilla with raymond burr in the early 1960s thats 50 years of reflection all the good and the bad my favorite is gojira but this movie has me rethinking that perhaps for sentimental reasons im not sure nevertheless this has the best plot of any toho or otherwise the characters are compelling and gojira i prefer the japanese name is a frightening force of nature recommended 100

Dec 9 2023,positive,i dont know how this movie got such a high rating it was okay not a bad movie but not great like the ratings have it it was okay is what ill describe as its okay not the best godzilla movie not the worst godzilla movie its just okay
Dec 9 2023,positive,the hype is real if you grew up watching godzilla movies then this is a no brainer   twinges of nostalgia throughout the movie and as many people have said this one you actually care about the humans and their stories in this movie how did they do such a good job with such a low budget when disney and wb and the rest are putting out dog  time and time again with hundreds of millions of dollar budgets  i loved it many have said its the best movie of the year i have no argument against that opinion go see it
Dec 9 2023,positive,ive got to say godzilla minus one is a great and respectful retelling of the og 1954 godzilla film the creature effects were excellent great story wonderful actors  japanese with english subs definitely worth seeing

Dec 9 2023,positive,this is a real throwback godzilla movie and not like the american versions of godzilla almost like a remake of the original from way back in the day story is a little slow but characters have real depth to them godzilla parts are outstanding and well worth the price of admission
Dec 9 2023,positive,it was great sounds and music alike original godzilla movie loud a good monster movie

Dec 9 2023,positive,best movie this year and the only godzilla movie where the plot and characters are fantastic love it
Dec 9 2023,positive,best movie ive seen in a while and my favorite this year take notes hollywood this is how you not only make a good movie or in this case a good godzilla movie but the story element and the human are relatable and grounded not to mention the music really makes this film hit hard and for a film with a budget of 15 million dollars that isnt overspend or overproduced or calling out fans to f off or hating them it still looks outstanding while respecting their fanbase     it is rare nowadays to make me feel for human cast but they did since its set after the ww2 and its them experience post war trauma just like the original 1954 but with modern technology and take and the good modern that isnt just there to pander to sacrifice story the only problem i have is that this isnt in a lot of theaters for people to see it because they wouldve loved this    i recommend this film not only for godzilla fans but anyone who want to see an actual good movie with a well written story if you have problem that your theater near you dont screen it find a theater that has it and plan a trip just to see it     or the safer rought is to wait until dvd or streaming but only time will tell
Dec 9 2023,positive,certainly a great godzilla movie but a pretty solid movie too
Dec 9 2023,positive,this was a perfect experience on big screen the ost vfx plot all in this movie is so divine and much more    thanks for all in this movie takashi yamasaki this is an 1010

Dec 9 2023,positive,absolutely brilliant   this is a very human story that just happens to have godzilla in it  the writing is spot on as are the performances direction cinematography  costumes and sound  you will become involved in these characters  the storyline will suck you in from the first frame and keep you involved till the end credits  this is not your typical monster movie  go see this film while its still in theaters

Dec 9 2023,positive,incredible storytelling the characters felt real and relatable even without a good understanding of the cultural nuances or historical significance that is to say that even without the addition of godzilla the characters themselves convey a story of hopelessness perseverance and a truly human perspective on the world they are experiencing more movies like these need to be made and hopefully with the same passion and patience for storytelling

Dec 9 2023,positive,godzilla minus 1 is some sort of heritage style bmovie the characterdriven film nods subtly in appreciation at hollywood while remaining an homage to mid20th century japanese popular cinema i especially appreciate how the story tellers eschew reliance on special effects or the emotions fear anger and aggression to garner attention instead they kept me engaged with charming characters thoughtful costuming and wellcrafted mise en scène a classic monster movie and an 8 of 10 overall

Dec 9 2023,positive,if you are a fan of the 1954 original godzilla film you will love this film
Dec 9 2023,positive,i thought it was a great movie  however in the beginning there is a place where the film slows down a bit for backstory and you have to get thru it to see all past that point  if you make it past that point it ramps up pretty quickly and continues being what we all love godzilla stomping the world
Dec 9 2023,positive,in spite of an incredibly small budget 15 million the film makers have managed to turn this movie into an instant classic its an emotional rollercoaster that had me rooting for humanity and thats no easy task these days the special effects arent great in some places but when a movie is so well written they dont have to be i would suggest hollywood film makers head over to japan at their earliest convenience and relearn how to make movies that are cringefree and watchable

Dec 9 2023,positive,the surprise of the year  i went into this expecting some good monster action but the human side of this movie was incredible and really emotional and deep  the movie couldve worked on its own with any other villain substituting for godzilla  the human story was that good but godzilla is as epic as heshe has ever been in this movie too  the rt rating is true  go see this movie see this movie on the biggest screen yo can find

Dec 9 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is definitely a triumph masterpiece of destruction i like the 2014 american version of godzilla but minus one is really thrilling and really great human drama and the terror about the war and bombs and the vfx looks really outstanding and the sound is really fantastic
Dec 9 2023,positive,the amount of times my jaw dropped mouth wide open in the middle of the theatre like wow insane film the story line and character development was just as good as the action i dont know which i enjoyed more youll laugh cry smile clutch your seat all that what a ride man i think i wanna go see it again cant wait for the sequel heard its already confirmed not a big deal at all but only thing that through me off was when the toddler crying sounded like a newborn baby fresh out the wound  if you watch youll see what im talking bout lol it just made me chuckle
Dec 9 2023,positive,best movie of the year easily
Dec 9 2023,positive,really good acting by the japanese cast  good story  was a throwback to the first few toho godzilla movies  tail swipe thermonuclear blast and finally they played the iconic godzilla theme towards the end  best godzilla movie since godzilla v monster zero
Dec 9 2023,positive,excellent take on the big g retro and contemporary at the same time thoroughly enjoyed the story and the human characters for once the humans are actually engaging and not just monster fodder though many are stomped on by godzilla a must see
Dec 9 2023,positive,loved the story and loved the action
Dec 9 2023,positive,i was a big godzilla movie fan as a young boy but wouldnt have guessed that i would still be a fan 50 years later this movie is great on so many levels and i wont spoil anything because it needs to be seen and experienced first hand on the big screen best godzilla movie yet made imho
Dec 9 2023,positive,just watched godzilla minus 1 in 4dx at the regal on union square   review  4dxthe seats rocked and rolled and threw me around like i was a twig  steam  in your face and your feet get zapped  it was a blast   the movie without all the gizmos  soso  the last 20 minutes were really good    people werent ready for the 4dx features and the special effects kicked in their soda and popcorn went flying haha
Dec 9 2023,positive,my favorite movie of 2023 what they did with a 15m usd budget is phenomenal   it reminded me of my experience watching top gun sitting at the edge of my seat    this is a perfect mix of characters you care for godzilla and action     even as a nongodzilla fan i would be surprised if you do not like it it is just a great movie overall    watch it in the cinema if you can and if you can choose a theater with a great sound system
Dec 9 2023,positive,an amazing movie it had a plot and you are invested in the characters it was worth it i will be seeing it again
Dec 9 2023,positive,magnificent the characters were actually more engrossing than godzilla couple them with the amazing special effects and storyline and you a winner
Dec 9 2023,positive,absolutely fantastic loved every second of it as a long time godzilla fan this is everything i could have wanted and it has actual good human characters
Dec 9 2023,positive,second only to the original gojira 1954  thrilling absorbing and emotional throughout this is also the most terrifying godzilla even scarier than shin  ive seen it three times and it just keeps getting better somehow  skreeonk
Dec 9 2023,positive,great melodramatic japanese story but only a few godzilla appearances
Dec 9 2023,positive,outstanding character development and engaging story this is a refreshing success in an otherwise disappointing year
Dec 9 2023,positive,surprisingly a really great film
Dec 9 2023,positive,so much fun the vintage feel and action sequences with the classic godzilla score were amazing saw it 2 days ago in imax and am already wanting to see it again my only criticism was the endingi think they could have gone different directions for better results
Dec 9 2023,positive,in a year full of insanely expensive shallow and forgettable hollywood blockbusters its so exciting to see one that doesnt skip out on the great characters impactful themes strong acting and sharp writing yes this movie has great godzilla action  the effects visuals audio and especially godzillas design are all impressive to the point that the movie is genuinely scary at times but the humanity behind this movie is its biggest strength thematically i loved what the film says about how we find meaning in our lives especially when tragedy strikes and we dont know where to go the family dynamic is excellent and the camaraderie among the minesweeper crew make this movie a joy to watch while koichis journey dealing with ptsd and survivors guilt give the movie a great emotional core even side characters like the youngest member of the minesweeper crew koichis neighbor and the mechanic have nuance    this movie is proof to me that audiences arent sick of blockbusters per se but theyre sick of bad mediocre and as i said earlier forgettable ones this is certainly not one of them and one of my favorites ive seen in a while
Dec 9 2023,positive,this movie was good in delivering fun kaiju action while also looking into the rebuilding of japan postwwii it was filled with action emotion and feel good moments after hair raising displays of power by the titular godzilla
Dec 9 2023,positive,the movie resembled the older films of godzilla we rad the story then and we read it today it was good
Dec 9 2023,positive,i watched this yesterday with my family we all enjoyed this film we all clapped and cheered at the end of the movie with everyone else must see and we will watch it again
Dec 9 2023,positive,this movie was excellent i saw it in screenx which definitely added to the cinematics and the overall experience it definitely feels like a return to the older godzilla movies where godzilla is more of the villain overall definitely one of the best godzilla movies to come out in recent years
Dec 9 2023,positive,the monster highlights the humanity needed to rebuild japan or any nation for that matter after world war ii surprisingly human for a monster movie
Dec 8 2023,positive,awesome movie good screen time balance between humans and monster
Dec 8 2023,positive,this movie was fantastic the story was awesome the cinematography was excellent an emotional and epic rollercoaster
Dec 8 2023,positive,the story was engaging and the characters were believable  the monster himself was good overall a great fun ride
Dec 8 2023,positive,the greatest movie i have ever seen in my opinion is better than 1900s godzilla
Dec 8 2023,positive,100 stars easy 
Dec 8 2023,positive,bit over explanation combined with awkward japanese acting was bit minus point for me but overall story was good and action scenes were intense cant believe they made this 15m
Dec 8 2023,positive,i love the movie because i love godzilla in this movie like this is the way first time in a long time that godzilla is the villain i love this movie so much please make a part 2

Dec 8 2023,positive,sweet sensitive heart warming and fun  loved this film
Dec 8 2023,positive,the story is amazing and i love godzilla the actors and actresses in this movie were phenomenal i would have liked the monster to move more natural then robotic when he walked into gonzo but still was amazing and i am watching the movie again will the introduce angriurs i hope so next up godzilla x kong the new empire cant wait godzillafan4life
Dec 8 2023,positive,maybe the best godzilla movie ever  spectacular special effects plus a solid back story  even great music to back up some very suspenseful scenes
Dec 8 2023,positive,best film ive seen all year shows you dont need 500mil to make a phenomenal movie emotional great takes on previous films and overall well done
Dec 8 2023,positive,a great monster flick classic godzilla vibes and even cooler when seen on screen x at the marcus ridge cinema
Dec 8 2023,positive,best godzilla ever great story
Dec 8 2023,positive,best movie of the year  epic and amazing
Dec 8 2023,positive,a godzilla movie with an actual human plot one that had me tearing up once or twice no less
Dec 8 2023,positive,love it characters were amazing
Dec 8 2023,positive,the fear that godzilla showed me in the 80s resurfaced this is a great movie
Dec 8 2023,positive,even though i couldnt understand a word they said the characters made you understand how they felt 
Dec 8 2023,positive,i really enjoyed it the action and fighting and the graphics were amazing
Dec 8 2023,positive,it doesnt matter if youre a godzilla fan or not it doesnt matter if youre slightly turned of by subtitles the story the pacing the characters the acting the cinematography the musical score the special effects and the direction all work in tandem to make this movie a hidden gem for western countries and probably the best movie of the year    this movie isnt just a monster movie its a human drama that tackles the questions of what happens to people when subjected to war and tragedy on a grand scale the movie tackles the questions of what it means to be a family a nation what is honor and how to find redemption    its the only movie ive seen this year that left a lasting impression its been a week since ive seen it and im still thinking about it thanks to an extended theater run in north america i will definitely view it again
Dec 8 2023,positive,good mix of drama  action i liked it godzilla was angry hes a hater
Dec 8 2023,positive,amazing story and cast really emotional and godzilla is horrifying
Dec 8 2023,positive,godzilla is mostly a backdrop for this movie but f it you arent watching it for him anyway for once you are watching it for the humans that you cant help but root for and get attached to this is a beautiful movie about people who have nothing fighting for survival gathering to fight a common threat but perhaps more importantly its about survivors guilt and heart i wont spoil anything but i am still crying even after getting home and typing this
Dec 8 2023,positive,probably the best movie of the year a throwback to amazing storytelling and a flawed heroes journey all that and the scariest godzilla ever put to screen probably the first film since the first film i found myself rooting for the people and not godzilla 95 out of 10 from me and now my favorite of all the godzilla movies
Dec 8 2023,positive,the is a great film that makes you care about the characters before all craziness starts to happen
Dec 8 2023,positive,rally rikicng grat movie lovd it
Dec 8 2023,positive,it takes a lot for me to actually go to the movies versus waiting for streaming the reviews of my beloved franchise for minus one were spot on cant wait to go again tonight excellent story line acting and overall fantastic cinema
Dec 8 2023,positive,the quintessential godzilla film it doesnt matter if youve never seen godzilla before or if youve seen every prior film you should see this movie
Dec 8 2023,positive,it was full of heart and great monster effects it wont be the same on the small screen gotta see this in theaters
Dec 8 2023,positive,certainly an unexpected surprise  this is a story of redemption with loads of emotion  youll see ptsd guilt and grief during wartime  the character development here was off the charts terrific and arguably some of the best since yes the original star wars  there wasnt one character in this movie that you didnt have some emotion tied to really well done there      obviously this is a godzilla movie however this is more of a character developmental story of our main protagonist  this was really well done on all aspects    my lone holdup being a foreign movie was the language barrier however as long as you can read subtitles well the emotion and communication with each scene was not an issue    the story was great but if i can find one minor issue with the movie would be that it should have kept some decisions rather than potentially sequel baiting or keeping the emotion tied to specific characters more permanent  if you see it youll know what im talking about  elsewise if you can consider this a standalone movie this was great
Dec 8 2023,positive,incredible its a throwback to the original godzilla movie format but with an awesome story and better effects
Dec 8 2023,positive,loved itstory was great and the fx lived up to the hype i had read
Dec 8 2023,positive,this is the best movie ever when i was a little kid my first watching all godzilla movie i wish i can make monster movie of mine too is because im a good artist and i will make it hard
Dec 8 2023,positive,a nearperfect movie great balance between the human element and the horror that is the king of the kaiju nearly brought to tears and i would rate this film equal to if not slightly better than the 1954 original
Dec 8 2023,positive,this is the best godzilla movie yet  its so rare you actually care about the human element in a kaiju film but they nailed it  then godzilla shows up and its even better   his design is the best to date  how they did this on a 15 million budget is beyond me
Dec 8 2023,positive,i saw it in just japanese on imax 4d in shinjuku on nov 17th then with english subtitles on dec 7th 8n ashburn va loved it great musical score and great story working with the aftermath of wwii it is a true honor to say it carries the torch of the original 1954 toho film well good cast and dialog godzilla had an amazing design and was ferocious
Dec 8 2023,positive,if you like godzilla scifi war action or thriller this is a mustwatch film even though its in japanese it is a film worth watching you wont be dissapointed better than 99 of hollywood movies these days
Dec 8 2023,positive,fantastic movie puts the american versions to shame
Dec 8 2023,positive,this is a good movie i hope one day it is dubbed in english it brings back the good old days five of the old godzilla movies
Dec 8 2023,positive,im a godzilla fan and i absolutely the idea of the of 1954 film not godzilla vs kaijus but godzilla vs humans and even the cgi is hella perfect and i love the new idea of the charging up the atomic breath this is the best godzilla movie for my opinion
Dec 8 2023,positive,first time ever rating a movie   felt i had to let people know the movie is amazing from human story to godzilla it truly is a must see on the big screen
Dec 8 2023,positive,it was a very good godzilla movie the best japan has produced it actually managed to make you care for the human characters where no other film has done aside from the original 50s film and shin godzilla and with shin i dont think it was done as well as this movie godzilla looks gorgeous his design was a mashup between the classic design and the legendary one if i had to nitpick the pacing could have been a little tighter and i wasnt wild about big ending spoiler incoming norikos survival i think it slightly cheapens the main characters ending it should have ended in my opinion with him coming back to get his daughter and him and her aunt hugging and crying but im a sucker for more somber melancholy endings lol
Dec 8 2023,positive,awesome  took me back to childhood
Dec 8 2023,positive,what was done with this movie that no other godzilla movie has ever been able to do is how a story should be told it makes you feel for the characters and the aftermath of war and disaster godzilla is a true villian in this movie its such a refreshing take to actually see him be the creature to fear i cannot say enough about how awesome it is to see a movie with a budget of 15 million absolutely wow you with the effects 1010
Dec 8 2023,positive,engaging character story great cgi youd never believe its a 15 million budget movie looks like a true blockbuster
Dec 8 2023,positive,wow definitely get to the theaters to see this masterpiece great story great godzilla great actor you definitely ride an emotional roller coaster in this one cant wait to see it again
Dec 8 2023,positive,needs to lose 10 min of drag but other than that an absolutely great movie
Dec 8 2023,positive,this is one of the best movies ive seen in a long time i went in not watching anything about it im buying it once its available bring tissues
Dec 8 2023,positive,one of the few giant monster movies where i didnt wish the humans would die so we could get to the monsters story quicker you could tweak this movie to remove the supernatural monster and there is still an interesting plot and interesting characters surprisingly evenhanded with the atom bomb and usa as mr not appearing in this film both are the invisible villains who are implied to have set the sea monster off godzilla himself acts mindlessly but gets more powerful the more he is attacked suggesting he is acting out of pain like the shin godzilla i dropped a star because it felt like the cinematography could have been better and the fire effect should have been improved
Dec 8 2023,positive,just saw it last night and was reminded how a good movie goes the visuals were excellent the actors were fantastic the pacing felt great and the thought that went into everything is felt i would say its the best movie of 2023 and probably in my top ten movies of all time
Dec 8 2023,positive,script couldve been better ending was too picturesque
Dec 8 2023,negative,cheap bmovie i couldnt find nothing good in it dont watch it is not worth it
Dec 8 2023,positive,loved everything about this film a must go see over and over movie 100 godzilla authentic
Dec 8 2023,positive,not just s good godzilla movie but a very good movie period very suspenseful and one of the few monster movies where you care about the human characters
Dec 8 2023,positive,really amazing movie as a godzilla fan myself this movie was intense awesome and i loved every second of it this definitely deserves the certified fresh
Dec 8 2023,positive,just an awesome movie
Dec 8 2023,positive,best movie of 2023  best godzilla movie too  because im a long time godzilla fan the soundtrack added a lot to the movie by using godzilla themes for the past
Dec 8 2023,positive,this movie lives up to all the reviews hollywood needs to be taking lessons this is how you make a great movie
Dec 8 2023,positive,there have been many versions of the godzilla mythology but in my opinion godzilla minus one is one of the best ive seen its a japaneselanguage film and its surprisingly explicit in its critique of various aspects of japans approach to its past history in wartime its commentary on war and nuclear power symbolised by the postwar emergence of godzilla is powerful and the themes of loss survival and hope add emotional depth    the story focuses primarily on sosaku tachibana a fighter pilot who has managed to avoid his fate as a kamikaze pilot by avoiding action altogether at one point in the film it is noticed that his plane hasnt been damaged the guilt of not fulfilling his orders including not defending his colleagues against godzilla early in the story haunts him and his internal struggles with this are constantly present as the story unfolds    the other characters are also welldeveloped and very relatable bringing a sense of stability in the middle of the chaos this adds a deeply human element to the story which focuses more on the humans than the action and special effects giving us a reason to empathise with and care about these characters rather than just seeking the thrills that come with this genre    having said that though the visual effects in godzilla minus one are stunning and bring godzilla a very intimidating monster to life with realism and fine detail and the action sequences are intense and exciting godzilla really feels powerful and destructive as it goes on its rampages    some viewers may find the plot a bit predictable but the godzilla mythology is wellembedded among many filmgoers so that may increase the sense of predictability and occasionally it is obvious that cgi has been used so there are moments when things seem a bit artificial and there is not much humour to lighten the relentless sadness and fear of the storyline    if you are a fan of monster movies and action films and especially of the godzilla story go and see godzilla minus one it delivers what it promises when it comes to spectacular visuals and intense action the explicit exploration of themes of war and loss is handled well
Dec 8 2023,positive,bit of a slow start imo but once you get through it and start to actually build attachment to the characters and their storylines you get engulfed in this thrilling plot that invokes a plethora of emotions from fear and sadness all the way to duty and patriotism a great execution that goes beyond the scope of its predecessors and touches on deep rooted topics of japanese 20th century culture and the effects that war had on both the mind and body of the country and its people havent sat on it for too long yet but as of right now it stands as my favorite rendition of the franchise ever
Dec 8 2023,positive,it was phenomenal and worth every moment spent watching it

Dec 8 2023,positive,the best godzilla movie ever two storiesrespect the origins of original godzilla good use of cgi and nostalgic scale  scene models
Dec 8 2023,positive,ive just returned home from my first viewing and i cant wait to share my thoughts the story follows a veteran of war as he overcomes survivors guilt and realizes through his found family and japans new struggle against godzilla his life has meaning and the importance of mankinds persistence in the face of adversity toho proves less is more by returning godzilla to his antagonistic roots as a standalone terror with its eyes set on japan no other monsters needed a worthy and wonderful franchise entry by writerdirector takashi yamazaki the film paves the way for a bright future of toho godzilla content the pacing of the film can be a little inconsistent at times however this hardly detracts from the glorious monster action and touching human storyline that make godzilla minus one one of the greatest entries in the franchise to date coming in at 3 on my list of all time favorite godzilla movies i happily give it a 455
Dec 8 2023,positive,best godzilla movie i have ever seen the visual effects was spectacular and great acting 1010 go watch it now in theaters for the best sound system
Dec 8 2023,positive,hollywood needs to learn something tell good stories give heart to your characters and it will do well this movie is a perfect example of oldschool storytelling very well done and definitely worth watching
Dec 8 2023,positive,godzilla minus one brings back the routes of the atomic horror that is godzilla but with a different perspective unlike 54 which focuses on the effects of nuclear warfare and shin which focuses more on the critique of the many restrictions japan has against threats shin focuses on the main character heavily with heavy messaging of regret trauma and how some may overcome it as well as how it always lurks within us with godzilla being the symbol of that a beautiful story that will forever resonate with us like 1954
Dec 8 2023,positive,i am 61 years old and seen all godzilla movies this one is different due to the fact that plot was well written and godzilla is cool so this makes it in the top godzilla movie in series the japanese know how to make a godzilla movie will entertain

Dec 8 2023,positive,great special effects we loved it im looking forward to a follow up movie
Dec 8 2023,positive,godzilla minus one blends its monster destruction with surprisingly captivating characters resulting in one of the king of the monsters finest cinematic outings
Dec 8 2023,positive,a fantastic film that reminds you what getting lost in the world of a movie should be like great story compelling characters and emotional stakes all come together as the titular monster fills you with both awe and dread the minus one aspect of the movie is just as important as the portrayal of a struggling nation plays an important factor in the developing relationships a must watch for fans of the genre and anyone who can appreciate a well written story

Dec 8 2023,positive,from start to finish i was engrossed with all of the characters godzilla is a force of nightmares and an uniting force by those still recovering from their on going struggles its rare for the human characters in a godzilla movie to carry so strongly but everyone in the cast here does a stunning remake of the orginal godzilla film that does everything perfect
Dec 8 2023,positive,great action and human interest
Dec 8 2023,positive,og godzilla is back every scene with godzilla was tense and had me reeling from everything going on the acting was some of the best ive ever seen in a godzilla film cant wait to get it for my collection

Dec 8 2023,positive,its amazing what actually story telling can do this movie single handedly showed what an actual godzilla movie can be when its not watered down  run this some garbage marketing filter id say maybe hollywood would take notes but thats not happening any time this century soooo worth seeing
Dec 8 2023,positive,not overhyped at all
Dec 7 2023,positive,an absolute masterpiece as an 80s kid this was imo the very best godzilla i have seen the wholesome yet heartbreaking character development was absolutely amazing love this and now i want more

Dec 7 2023,positive,what a great movie all the main human characters had lives that were well fleshed out to make an interesting story godzilla was used more as a metaphor than just a monster just stomping around but when he does appear whoa what great special effects this movie has really raised the bar for future godzilla movies
Dec 7 2023,positive,one of the best movies ive ever seen 
Dec 7 2023,positive,emotional and destructive at the same time definitely a contender for movie of the year
Dec 7 2023,positive,toho at their best a true godzilla movie felt like i was watching godzilla for the first time even though ive grown up watching everything from the 1950s classic to the animated series and even the matthew broderick flop and the most recent trainwreck from legendary loved this movie
Dec 7 2023,positive,this movie was truly awesome  one of the best representation of godzilla  in a film if not the best since the original
Dec 7 2023,positive,this is not just an excellent godzilla movie but also an incredible take on a wwii movie    the story of how a kamikaze pilot comes with failing his mission coming home to be called a coward and the reason the axis lost the war    then finding a reason to live and a purpose beyond just war    it also expands the godzilla mythos in a new and interesting way
Dec 7 2023,positive,this is easily the best film of the franchise and im hoping present and future screenwriters took notes    to make the title character not the star was a bold move but it paid off the storytelling of japan regrouping from wwii and the human condition is so phenomenal and compelling that at one point i forgot i was watching a godzilla movie but thats a toho for you    i cant wait for a sequel i need a sequel
Dec 7 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is a masterpiece this is the dark knight of kaiju films the story was great and well acted godzilla was at his brutal best i loved the orginal score too go see this in the theater before it leaves soon a
Dec 7 2023,positive,as others have said if you remove godzilla and just keep in the human parts  postwar devastation survivors guilt blame war traumatized people with amazing characters you get this years best movie    now add in godzilla  awesome   but even people who arent godzillamonster fans will love this    so so good
Dec 7 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is a masterpiece this is the dark knight of kaiju films the story was great and well acted godzilla was at his brutal best i loved the orginal score too go see this in the theater before it leaves soon a
Dec 7 2023,positive,best movie i have seen in years also the best godzilla movie  great plot characters toho is awesome
Dec 7 2023,positive,i went with my family and all of us were impressed  great movie
Dec 7 2023,positive,sincere acting  great special effects  magnificent storyline which kept me on the edge of my seat and in tears simultaneously
Dec 7 2023,positive,this is now the best godzilla movie ever made  it is full of action while paying homage and being more faithful to the original film series  it goes to show you dont need to americanize already good movies and stories for it to hit with american audiences
Dec 7 2023,negative,i went in expecting a lot given the rotten tomatoes rating i think it needs to be caveated  if you liked the original godzilla this is a remake of that first movie basically or a new origin story this isnt a fun monster fighting monster movie it was 90 all human story and maybe 10 monster the effects were ok
Dec 7 2023,positive,wow a really really nice godzilla movie  every godzilla screen time is amazing  story worthy of seeing again and again 
Dec 7 2023,positive,hollywood needs to take notes movie was amazingim going to see it a second time it was soooo well written you actually care about the characters visual fx look totally real hands down best godzilla movie everand best movie ive seen in i dont know how many years
Dec 7 2023,positive,the storytelling was actually amazing in this one scenes where beautiful and an amazing score would definitely recommend best godzilla film by far
Dec 7 2023,positive,even if you took the big guy out it would be an amazing period piece about immediate postwar japan 1945 to 1947 the original was set in 1954 after japan was starting to rebuild the devastation of tokyo and survivors guilt without excusing japans wartime actions and then they made godzilla the most horrifying hes ever been while scaling him back down to the original movie size hes not so big humans are beneath his notice he notices and absolutely hates them its an excellent drama its an excellent horror movie and its an excellent godzilla monster movie highly recommend
Dec 7 2023,positive,maybe best godzilla movie of the all one part kaiju one part ozu
Dec 7 2023,positive,what a great job by the screen writers   finally a monster movie where the monster is not buddies with some scientists or secretly in love with a human  king kong ice skating in central park was about as silly as it gets in any movie ever   the writers actually let a monster be scary and not have a soft spot for the puny humans  the story was also thought provoking as well given the history of japan for individual self sacrifice and questions about what a country should expect from the citizens  this is not just a movie for monster movie junkies  hollywood should take notes on how it should be done  one question  how did they make that little girl cry on cue   she is too young to take direction and those were some real tears  maybe i dont want to know
Dec 7 2023,positive,this is what movies should be a perfect blend between spectacle and story this is a film that not only takes godzilla back to his roots as a postwar allegory but expands upon those ideas in beautiful and unexpected ways godzilla minus one is such a compelling human drama that it would still be a fantastic movie without godzilla even being present and yet we are blessed with some of the most incredible and thrilling godzillamonster action we have seen to date after 5 viewings the film is still incredibly impactful and resonant i love it
Dec 7 2023,positive,best movie ive seen this year no one does godzilla better than toho
Dec 7 2023,positive,the best movie of the year by far felt like a teenager at the theatre again im probably going to watch it again this week bravo japan that was a masterpiece and its even more impressive it was so good despite a lower budget
Dec 7 2023,positive,excellent on par with shin godzilla a must see for die hard kaiju fans
Dec 7 2023,positive,it was a really good film it wasnt overly complex but it knew the 5 or 6 beats it wanted to hit and it nailed them also and not something i usually notice but i felt like the sound editing was great
Dec 7 2023,positive,i loved this movie it had a great storyline the monster was awesome but dont bring little children its in subtitles and kinda scary for the young ones
Dec 7 2023,positive,fabulous storytelling very engaging  best movie i have seen in a long time  a must see for any moviegoer
Dec 7 2023,positive,better than i expected
Dec 7 2023,positive,absolutely loved this movie if youre a fan of godzilla this movie is a must see
Dec 7 2023,positive,it is amazing to think that a 70 year old movie franchise has delivered us the best feature in its long run since the 1954 original this is the movie that i have waited for a serious dramatic what if that treats every aspect of the situation seriously the acting is top shelf the effects are onpoint save a few dodgy shots of boats in the water but all is forgiven when goji appears and the scriptthe script     it should be a no brainer but having a great script to tie all the monster mayhem together and make us feel for the characters is exactly the ticket    ive seen the movie three times now and each screenings audience has been bigger than the last    long live the king
Dec 7 2023,positive,a mustsee film you cheer for every human character in the film there is so much emotion the effects on godzilla are amazing and he feels like an angry embodiment of war its a remake of the original but pulls in elements from all eras of the franchise the originals plot beats monster island ghidorahs creation plot and legendaries animations
Dec 7 2023,positive,best movie i watched in 2023 will definitely watch again or own it if on itunes for purchase
Dec 7 2023,positive,stunning movie you will be engaged the entire time you will cheer and you will cry
Dec 7 2023,positive,it was nice that toho didnt personify godzilla minus one like legendary has in the monsterverse version this movie was about a giant monster with an animal instinct trying to destroykill people not a bumbling sentient being with a sense of humanity at its core   by definition a monster is frightening and godzilla minus one was just that the monsterverse godzilla is sort of a savior to humanity legendarys version fights ill intended creatures and any sort of damage is collateral whereas minus one is hell bent on destruction  i enjoy both of them but i prefer the mean toho godzilla minus one over the tame legendary godzilla ive seen all of the g movies though the decades this one is imo by far the best
Dec 7 2023,positive,great monster movie and moving drama story for post wwii japanese flick even one of my family members who is not a fan of subtitled movies and monster movies besides that really liked it
Dec 7 2023,positive,an amazing addition to the godzilla legend  the human parts are heartfelt and meaningful  godzilla feels like an unstoppable force of destruction
Dec 7 2023,positive,great movie absolutely nailed dragged my girlfriend along she hates kaiju movies and enjoyed it
Dec 7 2023,positive,possibly the best movie ive seen in 2023 a wonderful story line good amount of action solid acting and still that feel of original toho godzilla you know a movie is good when you dont even realize youre reading subtitles the entire time so much better than the hollywood godzilla garbage weve been given the past few years cant wait for the next one
Dec 7 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is awesome it was so good and my opinion the best movie of 2023 hands down
Dec 7 2023,positive,this movie was awesome it was not only a great gozilla movie it was a genuinely good film it gave a great look at post wwii japan from the perspective of the japanese themselves solid characters solid story and decent vfx make this well worth seeing i would love for hollywood to take some pointers from this and give us more films like this if you like disaster flicks and historical dramas then you will definitely enjoy this
Dec 7 2023,positive,ive been in love with godzilla for over 30 years this is my first experience seeing one straight from japan in imax thank you for the story and the nuance may godzilla live forever
Dec 7 2023,positive,i went into this movie knowing that it would be great and that id get the godzilla action i was looking for what i didnt know is that id leave the movie having that wish fulfilled along with eyes full of tears from the wonderfully portrayed human element in the movie this is a masterpiece in storytelling the ability to take a 70 year old franchise reboot it and make it better than its ever been is a feat on my list of favorite movies of all time
Dec 7 2023,positive,excellent story with very good acting  visual effects
Dec 7 2023,positive,it was one of the best movies i have seen in years so well made and the characters were amazing
Dec 7 2023,positive,the action was incredible godzilla was very scary the music was perfect
Dec 7 2023,positive,fantastic movie you really feel the anguish of the main human character  and the main main character godzilla is simply awesome the movie says something about humans which is what godzilla is really about it is a much better story and movie than the hollywood version but ill still go see those godzilla movies too
Dec 7 2023,positive,a horrifyingly personal match between humanity and monster it captures beats and imagery from the 54 version but tells a unique story that will hold well over time aspects have been adapted to add hope and utter despair
Dec 7 2023,positive,i admit the movie was good special effects the story setting and telling but there is one thing is nothing new when it comes to how the people of japan have to react to the coming of godzilla   as for the lead character with a redemption theme story is nothing new in few of the godzilla franchise     but i think shin godzilla was more of a better movie due to taking risk and you care for the people of japan just like minus one but it was different also as you do care of the evolution of godzilla in shin what will happen next especially the way it ended and sadly to say we will never get the sequel it deserves     godzilla minus one is a pass the time movie which you will watch here and there
Dec 7 2023,positive,still in awe of what i saw from the visuals to the score to the amazing story line  not just an amazing godzilla movie an amazing movie period
Dec 7 2023,positive,i saw the movie with my friend and all i have to say is are mouths were open the entire movie this movie is not just the best godzilla movie but the best movie ive seen
Dec 7 2023,negative,the cgi is the only noteworthy aspect of this film this movie lacks complexity the personality of the characters are under developed so it was difficult to feel any emotion for their tragedies or triumphs the scenes in which godzilla is causing destruction are short lived and were not dramatic enough to leave a lasting impression overall a very lackluster movie
Dec 7 2023,positive,taking it back to its roots but with an unbelievable focus on the resilient human spirit incredibly well written with massive vfx  suspenseful battles the sound editing emphasizes the emotional impact
Dec 7 2023,positive,a modern day masterpiece i do not often recommend movies but i would recommend this one it was one of those movies where it can be described as perfect or even near perfect the last movie that impacted me so strongly after i left was infinity war by marvel studios godzilla minus one puts hollywood to shame
Dec 7 2023,positive,extraordinary the building of characters in a godzilla movie low key kinda sounds far fetched but the character arks are absolutely flawless and you want every person to triumph the godzilla monster was absolutely stunning visually cant recommend this roller coaster of emotions in a godzilla movie enough 
Dec 7 2023,negative,other than the truly outstanding and perhaps unprecedented special effects this is a very bad film made by morons absolutely cringeworthy acting script story line ive never seen more horrible actors in one film do not believe the hype think for yourselves i seriously question the authenticity of the endless five star reviews all saying the same thing i believe the entire japanese cast and production team posted rave reviews for their own film with the help of google translate youve been warned proceed at your own risk prepare to cringe like never before the film is a mess i left thinking what did i just watch i wanted to like it but they all let me down kudos to the monster design and sfx brilliant team
Dec 7 2023,positive,what a great movie  do not let the subtitles stop you from seeing this movie  they do not get in the way at all  this is by far the best godzilla movie ever and isnt like the cheesie ones before this
Dec 7 2023,positive,yes it is true this is the first ever godzilla movie i have ever seen and oh my god what a fing fantastic movie i did not expect to love this movie at this level this was honestly a spur of the moment movie for me id seen everyone talking about this movie the amazing ratings so i booked a ticket which i actually got for free and man oh man this was so worth using my free ticket everything about this movie was amazing from the very beginning of the movie i was just hooked i had no idea what to expect throughout the entire movie it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time i dont know if this story is another repeat of previous godzilla films or not but all im going to say is that the story is fantastic so well written the line delivery from the cast was amazing those performances top tier the score the cinematography the visuals all of them just top tier especially for a movie about godzilla overall this movie was amazing i loved it easily one of the best 2023 movies and i would easily nominate this movie for the oscar of best international film no question there
Dec 7 2023,positive,just saw it tonight with my neice i grew up on the old heisei godzillas then adored the monsterverse made by legendary and this movie is just a sublime mix of both largely heisei the use of the original godzilla themes was nostalgic but not cringey and the terror i felt for the characters was great a godzilla movie made me elated for its human characters thats incredible
Dec 7 2023,positive,i liked this take on this movie
Dec 7 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is a great addition to the godzilla franchise a contrast to wbs godzilla films this is very reminiscent of the early godzilla films i would say the writing is phenomenal and beautifully written the cg is a little lacking and godzilla is a bit stiff but the story and acting are fantastic i would say it is worth seeing if you are a fan of godzilla or just a good story
Dec 7 2023,positive,i have two godzilla tattoos 4 movie posters 4 original set photos signed by the original cast have over 20 godzilla art pieces so i believe i have a good opinion when it comes to godzilla films this film is the best over the last 70 years it is an absolute must see act 2 does get a little slow for my liking but the pacing allows you to like the characters even more usually i root for godzilla this movie made me flip best human characters in a godzilla film which makes the ending that much more sweet  should be awarded best foreign film
Dec 7 2023,positive,the movie is epic in so many ways godzilla looks amazing the story is riveting the soundtrack is awesome definitely see this on the big screen
Dec 7 2023,positive,the terror the sorrow the destruction the crying easily top 5 godzilla movie and honestly this probably tops my personal list bringing godzilla back to basics hes the king of monsters yes but hes the embodiment of pure chaos takashi yamazaki brings the original kaiju back to basics at godzillas core it is the catalyst of destruction it ruins peoples lives the macabre of everyones fear something unpredictable and uncontrollable i love it as much as americans want to heroize the king of monsters at the end of the day godzilla is a force of destructive nature that unapologetically reeks terror on the land with that depiction of godzilla done correctly like it is here youre not going to have anything less of a top tier godzilla cinematic experience what adds on to greatness of this film is the powerful story yes this is yet another retelling of the origin but the film grounds you with the people you know they have survived a terrible event of biblical proportions you feel for them you feel their trauma it shows the perseverance of man and your chosen family this film even manages to squeeze in some laughs in terms of range and tone everything is perfectly balanced in my opinion the actors are great in showing their trauma love and fear great cast all around the cgi is stunning they went with the modern godzilla look but succeed in showing the battle damage he endures the close up shots are mega detailed the attention to detail for the in sea shots are amazing but what takes the cake is the atomic breathe in recent memory i cant remember godzillas beam being that damn disastrous along with an awesome soundtrack and the euphoria of hearing godzillas theme at the most appropriate times the cinematography is easily the best in any of the live action godzilla movies even better than gvk which is fantastic in its own right if youre a godzilla fan or even just a movie monster fan you have no reason to check this movie out it checks all the boxes and then some in terms of what makes godzilla great 
Dec 7 2023,positive,the terror the sorrow the destruction the crying     easily top 5 godzilla movie and honestly this probably tops my personal list bringing godzilla back to basics hes the king of monsters yes but hes the embodiment of pure chaos takashi yamazaki brings the original kaiju back to basics at godzillas core it is the catalyst of destruction it ruins peoples lives the macabre of everyones fear something unpredictable and uncontrollable i love it as much as americans want to heroize the king of monsters at the end of the day godzilla is a force of destructive nature that unapologetically reeks terror on the land with that depiction of godzilla done correctly like it is here youre not going to have anything less of a top tier godzilla cinematic experience     what adds on to greatness of this film is the powerful story yes this is yet another retelling of the origin but the film grounds you with the people you know they have survived a terrible event of biblical proportions you feel for them you feel their trauma it shows the perseverance of man and your chosen family this film even manages to squeeze in some laughs in terms of range and tone everything is perfectly balanced in my opinion the actors are great in showing their trauma love and fear great cast all around     the cgi is stunning they went with the modern godzilla look but succeed in showing the battle damage he endures the close up shots are mega detailed the attention to detail for the in sea shots are amazing but what takes the cake is the atomic breathe in recent memory i cant remember godzillas beam being that damn disastrous along with an awesome soundtrack and the euphoria of hearing godzillas theme at the most appropriate times the cinematography is easily the best in any of the live action godzilla movies even better than gvk which is fantastic in its own right     if youre a godzilla fan or even just a movie monster fan you have no reason to check this movie out it checks all the boxes and then some in terms of what makes godzilla great
Dec 7 2023,positive,this movie completely  one all of hollywoods blockbusters released this year its big intense and exciting despite the 15 million budget while also being emotional with characters you care about watch this movie
Dec 7 2023,positive,best movie of the year  wow  so different  did not expect a serious and super realistic new take on the old godzilla story  great cinematography  and the depiction of the japanese recently defeated in ww2 seemed very true  best godzilla movie ever  and i had grown weary of them so did not expect this gem  the almost unanimous 99 reviews by movie critics and general audience were surprising but turned out well deserved    it has english subtitles so be prepared for some reading no problem if you speak japanese     saw it 12523 at lertn amc    givin it max  5 stars  might see it again and again
Dec 7 2023,positive,this movie did a great job on showing the unity and heart of people coming together defend themselves in a common enemy godzilla is a villain that has no mercy in this film and you see how his destruction affects the people in his path the ending of the film had me feeling emotional excited and thrilled overall the film was really great
Dec 7 2023,positive,the movie was amazing the best godzilla movie to date the acting was amazing and the story was great it was great to hear godzillas theme music used to perfection it really helped highlight certain emotions in scenes its nice to see the japanese still know how to make a great movie hollywood should take notes and stop putting out the same predictable woke garbage over and over godzilla 1010
Dec 7 2023,positive,best godzilla movie ever refreshing full of emotion
Dec 7 2023,positive,back to the classic formula only with a much more frightening g
Dec 7 2023,positive,godzilla minus one takes the focus away from the giant monster and shows us the value of human life having just the right amount of giant lizard this film is a beautiful marriage of classic godzilla horror with a new and refreshing take
Dec 7 2023,positive,the story holds your attention the entire time the action is compelling and the characters are both relatable and respectable in a way that is truly stunning youll be actively rooting for them
Dec 7 2023,positive,an excellent moving story with it without godzilla  but godzilla himself is extremely impressive and genuinely frightening and awe inspiring
Dec 7 2023,positive,it slowed some but it was very good to watch monster war drama love story revengea little of everything yes close captioned works against typical theater still a good movie the idiots who give it 0 or 1 star yet refuse to watch it until english dubbed are low iq
Dec 7 2023,positive,probably the best iteration of godzilla
Dec 7 2023,positive,hands down amazing and breathtaking
Dec 7 2023,positive,best movie ive seen this year what a great story with godzilla sprinkled in
Dec 7 2023,positive,was really enjoyable a film in the spirit of the original characters you care about not just cgi background good enough to see more than once
Dec 7 2023,positive,this is hands down the best movie ive seen all year best in a long time the story and characters are so compelling i was drawn in right away and loved the acting so many great performances it felt like an old classic at times i was blown away really really well done
Dec 7 2023,positive,first timers be warned its a beautiful callback to the classics
Dec 7 2023,positive,a great characterdriven monster movie
Dec 7 2023,positive,great movie felt like i was 12 years old on a saturday afternoon
Dec 7 2023,positive,great filmmaking and strong committed cast  its godzilla 1947 japan a period piece with aaa period detail thruout  its also godzillanoir the main character struggles over and over with survivor guilt from wwii  its nothing like the more upbeat westernized legendary godzilla with the monarch overstory  where the monarch godzilla is more dramatic and imaginative godzilla 1947 is more about honoring godzilla as an artistic japanese creation  at the end after godzillas takedown all the sailors salute godzilla      its great filmmaking the script took three years to write  the inevitable godzilla takedown is a collaborative effort of decommissioned japanese naval sailors a voluntary group of citizens working against impossible odds  an even greater positive collaborative group effort can be seen in the great chinese film the wandering earth netflix  the script took three years to write  its basically a nonironic remake of godzilla 1954 reimagined with better plot better human characters and better vfx     its too long 124 mins  cutting 2025 minutes would have helped it do better at the box office  its also a toho film     washington post  top gun maverick and this godzilla show us theres an audience for movies which combine concise and creative action with emotionally resonant human characters  yes as in the best of the legendary monarch godzillas the balance also works here    film stage  its willing to stay in the quiet anguish of several characters for uncomfortable lengths of time so the ultimate release is all the sweeter    empire  a refreshingly humanist and nostalgic reboot of the iconic monster franchise takashi yamazakis godzilla minus one takes the atomic lizard back to his postwar roots while making the most of the directors background in animation and vfx direction through convincing tactile and classic design work
Dec 7 2023,positive,this movie had such an amazing story which had me crying at times godzilla was absolutely terrifying i think this might be the best one ever made
Dec 7 2023,positive,everything in this movie works perfectly takashi yamasakis cinematography is astonishing and memorizing kamiki ryunosukes acting is truly worthy of an oscar as you can feel the intensity and emotion in his character godzilla is one of if not the best antagonist in 2023 as godzilla leaves no mercy for anyone the only issue that i had was the fact that since it was made in japan the movie needed subtitles to translate it into english and the translations distracted me from being able to fully watch everything around the film overall though it is a great film that has some of the best conflict and possibly the best third act ever
Dec 7 2023,positive,about as good as i think you can make a godzilla movie  extremely japanese and my japanese wife whos never seen a godzilla movie in her life loved it  i also loved it  i dont think you have to understand japanese culture or have seen past godzilla movies to appreciate it but it likely helps
Dec 7 2023,positive,great movie  subtitles didnt bother me at all  really loved the character development
Dec 7 2023,positive,unbelievable how great this movie is most of the time looking at you hollywood we could care less about the human characters in monstergodzilla movies however godzilla minus one gives us characters to root for and a monster that is truly scary and fearsome i dont want to spoil it so ill just say go see it in a movie theater now
Dec 7 2023,positive,the best godzilla movie to date and of 2023
Dec 7 2023,positive,i didnt like this movie i loved it story lines have now improved in the godzilla franchise shows you can have a godzilla movie without godzilla there all the time not for the ones who dont have an attention span
Dec 7 2023,positive,a very pleasant surprise for a monster movie indeed from the fantastic acting to the special effects this is one of the best movies ive seen this year the only down side to this movie is that the second half drags a bit but overall this movie delivers a must go see in theaters for sure
Dec 7 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is the clearest example of how to make a beautiful film with a small budget could be a lock for the visual effects oscar the story is balanced and the characters are real enough to root for the simple film is straight forward and back to basics which is why it works overall this is what great films look like
Dec 7 2023,positive,whoa how is a godzilla movie this good incredible run dont walk for sure theater experience of the year
Dec 7 2023,positive,went to the imax to see itvery very good godzilla movie excellent effects and a great human storyline to boot  better than so many other wannabee godzilla movies
Dec 7 2023,positive,an absolute masterpiece with gripping characters and a terrifying godzilla all wrapped up in a powerful story about redemption the sanctity of life and the triumph of the human spirit minus one is easily among the best entries in the franchise as well as the entire kaiju genre
Dec 7 2023,positive,it was probably the best godzilla movie ever made it reminded me of being a kid in the 70s watching the old bw godzilla movies on saturday afternoons
Dec 7 2023,positive,i liked their use of the original music from the original 1st godzilla in 1954 godzilla ended up being everything he was before but clearer  meaner well done guysdidnt disappoint
Dec 7 2023,positive,very human story not typical big monster schlock
Dec 7 2023,positive,absolutely amazing so much emotion
Dec 7 2023,positive,please make more of these
Dec 7 2023,positive,masterpiece is literally an understatement ive never been a huge fan of godzilla but this movie absolutely changed my mind i will be showing my children this movie when they get older there was nothing they couldve added or taken away to make this movie any better wow just wow
Dec 7 2023,positive,instant classic right up there with the original 1954 masterpiece love the ode to 1956 american version with the newscasters  everything you want from a classic godzilla film
Dec 7 2023,positive,one part jurassic park one part jaws one part oppenheimer one part dunkirk this is an outstanding movie that will have you emotionally invested into it the characters you are rooting for their success and well being godzilla is scary and a real threat in this movie music score if phenomenal building tension and seriousness with the absent of music at times must see movie in the biggest theater with a good sound system
Dec 7 2023,positive,perfect encapsulation of the allegory that is godzilla nothing legendary has done has made me care for the human characters this movie made me care by making the human drama and the lessons hidden there in the focus of the film in a time when too many movies are focusing on cgi over storytelling this film is a standout masterpiece
Dec 7 2023,positive,stunning and magnificent a really great storyline that is entrancing  which is more about post wwii japan than about godzilla i loved it
Dec 7 2023,positive,godzilla fans are eating good lately and im loving it
Dec 7 2023,positive,best movie of the year and best godzilla to date
Dec 7 2023,positive,cinema really makes you appreciate the human characters and godzilla is a sideplot but it all comes together and gives godzilla his screen time where he shines
Dec 7 2023,positive,loved this movie  simple but really good and emotional story  didnt think id get that in a godzilla movie but i really enjoyed it  the right amount of godzilla in the movie and he was the terrifying monster hes supposed to be
Dec 7 2023,positive,sound design and story are peak
Dec 7 2023,positive,this movie is pretty good and the godzilla in this one is scary
Dec 7 2023,positive,almost the best godzilla movie after the original 1954 gojira and about equal to 2016s shin gojira blows all the others away including all of legendarys monsterverse offerings
Dec 7 2023,positive,i came out of the movie theater thinking wow this movie is the first godzilla movie that has focused on the heart and the plot of the story instead of the action and special effects i wouldnt change a thing about the plot the movie also has a sense of redemption both for the characters and world war 2 japanese culture this movie is jaws with japanese soldiers even though the ending was slightly predictable and the cgi of the godzilla was a little sketchy at times i was still impressed this movie is very sad and intense there were some scenes where my heart was pounding and my fingernails were digging into my legs i think that this is a great movie must see
Dec 7 2023,positive,i was thoroughly impressed and moved by this movie and the acting it leaves you with an emotional attachment to the characters which makes it so great i wont be surprised if it gets nominated for something big
Dec 7 2023,positive,i thought it would be a good movie and then it was 10x better than what i anticipated i really hope they make a sequel and i hope this goes to streaming soon so i can watch it over and over definitely a must watch best film of 2023 by far
Dec 7 2023,negative,fellow movie goers beware this redundant addition to the godzilla franchise is one of the worst movies ive ever seen recommended by rt and im afraid there might be some kind of shady action here i cant imagine anyone not insulted by this hot mess where i can see benefits from this movie is teaching aspiring film students what not to do lets start at the beginning unlike its cousin the surreal rodan 1956 yamazaki breaks the first rule of monster moviemaking by showing him in the opening scene in the same scene the hero gets a chance to fire a 40 mm gun at big g but doesnt why after this 10minute scene we get a lot of who cares screenwriting trying desperately to bring human gravity to what is essentially an overthetop thrill ride monster movie really seeing a movie like this makes one appreciate spielbergs human touch in his classic jaws all the scenes are too long ploddingly paced and the screenwriting is cliche boring and wildly predictable the film looks like its been blown up from 16 mm and the special effects still make big g look like a guy in a rubber suit aside from names like kurosawa and ozu maybe japan should stick to building great cars and leave the monster genre to the young at heart
Dec 7 2023,positive,the best modern day godzilla to date reall hard to fathom that it had a 15 million budget the story is very well done with historical context thrown in they do a great job with making you emotionally invested in the characters and obviously godzilla hes also the most powerful and ruthless godzilla weve ever seen
Dec 7 2023,positive,i heard really good things but i didnt expect this movie to be so amazing great story and fantastic acting and directing
Dec 7 2023,positive,best godzilla movie ever made the vfx was amazing the shots at godzilla in water amazing the human storyline amazing we need more godzilla toho films every 34 years i give it a rating 1010
Dec 7 2023,positive,i cannot give this movie enough praise from beginning to end this movie kept me on the edge of my seat its a must see
Dec 7 2023,positive,i took my wife who is thai and my son to the movie and we loved it my son loves kanji movies whereas i have never been a huge fan of them in my life my son is 9 yearsold and i am 53 yearsold my only complaint of the movie is that it is slightly melodramatic in a few scenes nonetheless we loved it we saw it in imax also which i recommend
Dec 7 2023,positive,by far the best godzilla movie the focus on story and the horror of godzilla rather than spectacle was a smart decision for the first time in this franchise i truly experienced the terror of godzilla
Dec 7 2023,positive,it was very close story of  first  godzilla movie  i like it
Dec 7 2023,positive,this movie is most definitely one of the best movies of the year and in the godzilla franchise
Dec 7 2023,positive,amazing movie loved it
Dec 7 2023,positive,im not a movie no at all critic haha but godzilla minus one is more than a godzilla movie also it refreshed the original 1954 movie so well that personally not many movies now adays can remake a original like minus one did to the 1954 movie im only 23 haha its a deeper meaning behind it you can find some flaws but what movie has no flaws to me this movie was everything good and right
Dec 7 2023,positive,possibly the scariest godzilla monster ever  the human drama was compelling in the beginning but turned into a long painful slog toward by the end  seriously koichis hamhanded ugly crying near the end made me want to puke as did a couple of the act three plot twists  the scenes with the monster though are pretty great especially the attack on tokyo  it was brilliant to bring the original music back that was a great touch  one question though  why do they continue making godzillas head so small now  he looks like a gymbunny all roided out  part of what makes g so scary to me at least is his intelligence  give the big lizard a more representative head size
Dec 7 2023,positive,ive seen a lot of godzilla movies since i was a kid from the bad to the horribly good to the great this is a great popcorn movie with some very good godzilla scenes in it some predictable parts but that comes with the territory this is still a monster movie so what the audience is mainly salivating for is good cgi lots of good scary monster shots lots of destruction and getting strongdecent human characters is just a plus so i think this movie checked all the boxes 
Dec 7 2023,positive,thought it was great saw some cgi that wasnt quite right but still good
Dec 7 2023,positive,the most against ive ever been for a godzilla shows how devastating this godzilla is and scary he can be yamasakis vision came together greatly
Dec 7 2023,positive,please make sure you see this movie it will be a travesty if this movie doesnt have multiple oscar nominations best picture and best foreign film at a minimum the writing is exceptional the acting beyond professional the special effects were exactly what this 70 year series needed take your teenagers to this movie and introduce them to the original og kaiju
Dec 7 2023,positive,a refreshing take on the kaiju genre    unlike recent hollywood godzilla films which often prioritize spectacle over substance godzilla minus one takes a more grounded approach the film is set in postwar japan a time of great hardship and uncertainty godzillas arrival is not just a disaster but also a symbol of the nations trauma and resilience    this focus on human drama elevates the film above your average monster movie the characters are welldeveloped and relatable and their struggles are genuinely affecting we see the impact of godzillas destruction on their lives both physically and emotionally
Dec 7 2023,positive,the first godzilla that made me care about the humans more than the monster  added points for the ww2 tech accuracy takao yukikaze hibiki and j7w reveal d
Dec 7 2023,positive,just finished watching godzilla minus one  this movie is so good that i felt compelled to sign up with rotten tomatoes to provide a 5 stars rating reviews a good story well told
Dec 6 2023,positive,this film was amazing 10010 so film is the greatest godzilla film on them planet better then the american films godzilla minus one has amazing vfx and cgi and it is truly a film to watch
Dec 6 2023,positive,rawprimal and agonizingly brilliant
Dec 6 2023,positive,great take on the king of monsters really explores the metaphorical lovehate relationship the japanese have with godzilla the most touching and moving of the entire franchise the setting in post war japan is spectacular and adds a special context to story great to see in original version as seen in japan
Dec 6 2023,positive,saw this movie 2 times in a regal rpx screen  this is in my top favorites list of 2023  such a good movie  thank you toho
Dec 6 2023,positive,so much more than a simple godzilla movie ran me through the emotional roller coaster and i loved every minute of it
Dec 6 2023,positive,loved this one best godzilla movie ive ever seen ive seen all of them full japanese cast with subtitles no english but just emotive and expressive in their performances
Dec 6 2023,positive,best godzilla movie ever made you will cry and you will be in awe of this movie go watch
Dec 6 2023,positive,what a glorious return of liveaction godzilla to the hands of actual japanese filmmakers this film is about so much more than godzilla using the aftermath of wwii as a powerful backdrop and exploring deeply personal and emotional moments with our small cast of characters its got the action and the beautiful jawdropping destruction youd expect from our kaiju friend but it doesnt get so caught up in the fanfare that it loses touch the cgi while not quite seamless is incredibly impressive given the films tiny budget some of the acting and dialogue are a little over the top for my taste but its definitely a bit of a cultural thing overall this is a great return or introduction to godzilla for anyone who loves a great story beautifully written characters and a little monster mashing
Dec 6 2023,positive,great godzilla movie i havent been to theaters in a while but this movie made me go back and it was worth it
Dec 6 2023,positive,what an amazing movie 
Dec 6 2023,positive,love the action and suspense and story line
Dec 6 2023,positive,much like shin godzilla before it godzilla minus one seeks a return to the solomonster horror roots of the franchise while shin godzilla served as a critique of a bureaucracy unable to respond adequately to crisis minus one aims for a more personal story of survivors guilt and trauma and pulls it off exceptionally well     godzilla being so large steals the screen whenever its around and its mere presence is enough to cause catastrophic loss of life without it even intending such devastation once again a manifestation of the horror of atomic warfare the creature is once again reimagined and doesnt suffer for having a lesser height than its american counterpart    all in all godzilla minus one elevates itself above being just a giant monster movie and manages to craft a touching and dramatic personal story amidst a country struggling with its identity
Dec 6 2023,positive,ive loved godzilla movies since i was a kid  the recent us adaptations were entertaining but still lacked something that made the original 1954 movie so effective  this movie captures the magic of the original and then some  behind the special effects and musical score is a great story and character development  you begin to feel for the characters as they try to adjust to postwar life and deal with the appearance of a giant monster  this makes godzilla more scary because you see it from the perspective of the people  it feels a bit more like a horror movie than the us monsterverse movies
Dec 6 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is a riveting and captivating film that redefines the boundaries of the classic monster genre this cinematic masterpiece directed by visionary filmmakers seamlessly blends cuttingedge cgi with a compelling narrative delivering an unforgettable experience for both diehard fans and newcomers alike    the movie sets a new standard for storytelling within the monster universe skillfully crafting a storyline that delves deep into the emotional core of its characters while maintaining the aweinspiring spectacle of colossal creatures battling it out on the big screen the character development is exceptional offering a poignant exploration of humanitys resilience in the face of unimaginable devastation    one of the most striking aspects of godzilla minus one is its breathtaking visual effects the meticulous attention to detail in bringing these legendary monsters to life is nothing short of astonishing every roar every thunderous footstep and every destructive clash between titans feels incredibly realistic immersing the audience into the heart of the action    moreover the films musical score deserves immense praise for enhancing the overall atmosphere and intensifying the emotional impact of each scene the soundtrack perfectly complements the onscreen spectacle creating a symphony of epic proportions that resonates long after the credits roll    in addition to its technical brilliance godzilla minus one successfully balances adrenalinepumping action sequences with moments of genuine depth and introspection it explores themes of sacrifice bravery and the indomitable human spirit making it a thoughtprovoking and emotionally resonant cinematic journey    overall godzilla minus one is a tour de force in the realm of monster movies setting a new benchmark for the genre with its breathtaking visuals compelling storytelling and powerful performances this film is an absolute mustwatch that will leave audiences exhilarated and moved in equal measure
Dec 6 2023,positive,its a good old godzilla film by toho solid acting and solid action
Dec 6 2023,positive,sleeper awesome period maybe the best godzilla movie ever
Dec 6 2023,positive,you absolutely need to see this movie it was absolutely the best thing ive watched in the last 5 years the action sequences are spectacular and the soundtrack is truly goodly you just have to see this moovie
Dec 6 2023,positive,really great blend of classic godzilla action and a human story
Dec 6 2023,positive,the move is just incredible from the visual effects to the music to the human story it is justbeautiful
Dec 6 2023,positive,an absolutely fantastic breathtaking and emotional film
Dec 6 2023,positive,as a godzilla fan since the 90s this is pure gold godzilla is a menace from start to finish human element was the best over ever seen you actually gave a damn especially with it begin post world war 2 you see everything and i couldnt be happier for the rebirth of the king of the monsters godzilla
Dec 6 2023,positive,great movie enjoyable exciting and a very good human story as well
Dec 6 2023,positive,godzilla minus one thoroughly defied my expectations every single scene feels weighty and impactful not just the ones that feature the titular monster destroying tokyo     i never once found myself impatiently wishing for the real action to begin because the movie actually gave me reasons to be invested in the characters its an excellently crafted experience the themes permeate all throughout the storytelling the characters are relatable and well written godzilla is terrifying the performances can be heartwrenching and it is just incredibly evident that the director takashi yamazaki had a real vision for this movie anyone that worked on this film absolutely deserves to be proud of their work    its great and im eagerly awaiting whatever takashi yamazaki does next
Dec 6 2023,positive,best godzilla movie in a long time not just a masterpiece monster movie but a great story and characters go see it now and on imax if you can
Dec 6 2023,positive,best godzilla film as far as story truly a great film by toho and cant wait for the next film in this series
Dec 6 2023,positive,i loved the godzilla franchise ever since the first godzilla movie came out this film was phenomenal and deserved all five stars a must see movie before 2024
Dec 6 2023,positive,toho once again shows us how a truly substantial and beautifully written and compelling movie in kaiju cinema can be takashi yamazaki clearly shows dedication and excellent film direction with his characters and plot which are both easy to follow godzilla in over 7 years since shin godzilla has once again showed brutality and a dark atmosphere to the original godzilla film while the characters and the overall tie to the original film is clearly showing i do wish that a certain character had a bit different character arc i also wished for a little bit more destruction to japan nonetheless minus 1 is a must watch for any new or old gojira fan
Dec 6 2023,positive,incredible movie it feels so refreshing not to see agendas politics and wokeness just a pure human story with an amazing horror element in form of the best godzilla the world has ever seen
Dec 6 2023,positive,overall great film if you can support this type of movie    fist of all im not a godzillamonster fan i remeber watching the campy man in a suit smashing modles as a kid and never really got in to it more recent big budget movies like konggodzilla didnt do much to spark my intrest however this one is well done and with a reported budget of 15million it makes just about all the recent movie budget seem completely unreasonable
Dec 6 2023,neutral,look its fine not great for me i dont think i could pick up on the metaphors or essence of some cultural aspects
Dec 6 2023,positive,i liked the movie but not enough of godzilla and it was too easy to kill him i was happy to see more ocean battles but not enough land battles  but in all the best toho movie yet
Dec 6 2023,positive,not only an excellent monster movie also just a very good movie look pictures the music and how it is used great movie
Dec 6 2023,positive,wife and i saw godzilla minus one the first weekend and totally recommend it it really is the best godzilla film ever made from a human and dramatic standpoint    the film is not really about the monster its about the people struggling to survive in postwar japan there are heartbreaking moments that dont have anything to do with godzilla    the monster isnt in most of the film but when it appears good god the effects are amazing this isnt a guy in a rubber suit kicking toy cars around there are some moments when godzilla is attacking warships that just took my breath away  and this film was made for 15m  it raises the question how did hollywood lose the ability to make compelling films on a budget    it had some nice touches like the us allowing japan to rearm some of their ships to deal with the menace and postwar tension between the us and the soviets comes in to play  its not a monster movie its more like what if godzilla happened in the real world at the tail end of world war ii    theres a heartbreaking moment where a former admiral addresses a room full of emotionally scarred combat vets trying to raise enough volunteers to fight the monster  these people are all emotional wrecks completely exhausted defeated and for many with their families destroyed but somehow have to pull themselves together to meet this new challenge  its a very compelling scene and would work in a variety of genres not just monster films    its just a really good film like scorsese had done a monster film  go see it    my understanding is that there will be a competing godzilla film released next year and theres some kind of contractual thing where they both cant be in theaters at the same time  so end of december 2023 godzilla minus one has to leave theaters    the real tragedy is that this film is popular and theaters could really use the business
Dec 6 2023,positive,the best film ive seen this year by far
Dec 6 2023,positive,it was incredibly wellbalanced the action is captivating the emotional journey of the protagonist is engaging and relatable and the effects although wonky at moments are absolutely stunning
Dec 6 2023,positive,i give it 4  half only because godzilla didnt have as much screen time as i wanted but thats just me loving the monster its a good touching drama story plus the action scenes totally worth it and the ending wow no regrets and it wont be for you either im glad i saw it on the big screen thank you again godzilla creators
Dec 6 2023,positive,this is a good moviebut not great  upfront i am not a huge godzilla fan but this was very well done  it has subtitles and while i typically hate subtitles they actually improve this movie and it would been worse if it had been done in english    unlike the other godzilla movies i have seen in the past they made the characters compelling something their competitors the marvels new hunger games and wish failed to do      i have pity for the failed and flawed male lead definitely not a mary sue  my heart went out to the female lead as well  both of them have compelling character arcs  their goals and life choices are logically consistent with how they were presented by the director  moreover the director presented traditional japanese culture in a thoughtful way without unnecessary negative commentary     this is a godzilla movie so do not expect to see accuracy in science this is meant to be fun not technically accurate  if you demand technical accuracy this is not the movie for you     in sum this is a fun and novel twist on an old tale that did not need to current day the story    well worth your time
Dec 6 2023,positive,perfect a work of art if you ask me
Dec 6 2023,positive,this move was so good if you can watch it in imax you will not regret it
Dec 6 2023,positive,the movie was well made even though watched the movie in japanese with subtitles the main theme and story was easy to follow many plot setups had good pay off at the end the monster was shown as scary and had real consequences for that world the special effects were good ww2 backdrop for the movie made in more interesting where the weaponry was limited overall must watch
Dec 6 2023,positive,i still cant believe what a magnificent film this is  its the first time in 50 years that i loved the characters and wanted them to defeat godzilla who is truly terrifying i was rooting for them all and actually cried twice themes of antiwar loss selfforgiveness family  and a country joining together for a cause they believe in  all of that is here plus a spectacular monster we all cheered and applauded at the end thank you takashi yamazaki and the wonderful cast
Dec 6 2023,positive,this movie was great  although godzilla only had a few moments in the movie overall his presence was felt in every scene  the attention was set mainly on the human cast and you end up building a connection to the actors and begin wanting them to be okay  it probably the first godzilla movie where i enjoyed the human story as much as the monster story
Dec 6 2023,positive,this movie captures the spirit of the japanese original and is the best kajui movie in decades
Dec 6 2023,positive,this was movie was not what i was expecting they managed to make a godzilla movie and give it a heart wrenching story dealing with a lot of heavy themes this is the best godzilla movie ever made best movie aside from oppenheimer so far
Dec 6 2023,positive,the underlying story was fantastic with godzilla thrown in  was well done all around got the right amount of titan scenes and a very well put together post wwii story
Dec 6 2023,positive,this is the best godzilla movie i have seen since i watch the original staring raymond burr with my dad back when i was in my single digits  that they made this a story with a human protagonist on the heros journey with the monster godzilla driving the action was refreshing brillant
Dec 6 2023,positive,i went into this thinking it was going to be like those old b godzilla movies with the bad dubbing i hadnt watched any trailers or read any reviews and wow this was not at all what i expected it was a roller coaster ride from start to finish i only wish it had been in 3d because godzilla was big realistic and terrifying one of the best movies i have seen all year
Dec 6 2023,positive,expectations were met as a fan of monster movies loved the setting and character development im personally not much for subtitles however worth it atomic breath was incredible recommend seeing it in theaters for sure
Dec 6 2023,positive,i have been watching godzilla and things like ultraman since i was a kid i think i saw my first godzilla film on bob wilkins creature features on channel 2 out of san francisco i know i saw godzilla vs the smog monster hedorah in a drive through theater which probably was around late 1972 as it took a while to get to the us    anyway i can say this is hands down the best godzilla film however a caveat to that is what makes it so good is because it is a reboot this is how you reboot a film you take the essence of the original storyies and repurpose it this wasnt a blatant nostalgiaest like the last 3 crap star wars films this was them using the tropes perfectly the scientist with the weird hair the hardened old soldier the stern military guy with no neck and on and on it was perfect    i like to say the people my age have star wars music in our dna well listening to the music shows i have kaiju in the blood as well the music was almost a character itself plus there is so much i can say about this but wont for space reason i will say this is one of the few godzilla films ive ever seen where the human story is just as good as watching godzilla do his thing  and there was no annoying kid sidekick  thank the maker    go see this film right now
Dec 6 2023,positive,i have seen all the godzilla movies i have watched the recent ones with avid fascination of the overly explosive and cheesy plotlines and soaked in every monster fight rooting for godzilla mourning for mothragodzilla minus one made me almost hate godzilla this movie was heart wrenching and humane barely breathing in some parts the budget of this movie was 15 million dollars and its worth is well over thatthe best godzilla movie i have ever seen something that will not be surpassed rooting for the unseen is what makes a director the absolute best i will see anything he puts out from now on
Dec 6 2023,positive,mwa perfection1010 w
Dec 6 2023,positive,its difficult for me to explain how much raw joy this movie made me feel its been a long time since a godzilla film made me care about the people it followed shin godzilla had the perfect approach where it was less about individuals and more about how a government would handle a kaiju situation while godzilla minus one focuses hard on a small group of people it also makes you want to stay with that group    the movie has a perfect blend of classic godzilla terrifying in its raw power and primal motivations while also showing you a tale of redemption honor grief and love    if youve ignored most godzillas thinking they were campy schlock im looking at you 2014 2019 2021 you wouldnt be wrong but please do not pass on godzilla minus one    this movie does not treat the audience like idiots nor does it have the feeling of smirking at its intelligence truly perfect
Dec 6 2023,positive,the best godzilla movie ever
Dec 6 2023,positive,one of the best made and handsome productions in the toho franchise of godzilla  the story centered more on one man and his experience s of being in ww2 godzilla was the catalyst for the film  on a modest budget the film did capture the grandiose feel of  a larger film but its the limited use of godzilla himself that achieved this effect   and while exceptional in its use it didnt have the over all scale of a hollywood production maybe thats better maybe thats worst its kind of how scifi fans compare the difference in the star wars franchise and  the star trek franchise  less is more more or less
Dec 6 2023,positive,it was amazing the best godzilla movie since the first one
Dec 6 2023,positive,films character development and monster appearances hit every single beat that not only recall the classic godzilla films but also remind us the human element behind the shock and awe godzilla fans should rejoice
Dec 6 2023,positive,one of the best movie in years you actually care about the human characters
Dec 6 2023,positive,an incredible 70th anniversary for godzilla
Dec 6 2023,positive,can we just let toho do all godzilla movies from now on because shocker they seem to understand how to do a godzilla movie more than what hollywood has been attempting to do for more than 30 years for the first time in a long time im actually caring for the human characters in a godzilla movie
Dec 6 2023,positive,godzilla minus one truly captures not only the nuclear aftermath of wwii but also the determination of the japanese peopleculture japan suffered a devastating loss and the fight against a force of nature such as godzilla creates another war also with nuclear repercussions for the nation the character connections felt genuine and even though godzilla only had about 40 of the screen time it created an atmosphere of fear but also a stage for the human cast to shine best film of 2023 well done toho
Dec 6 2023,positive,a fantastic godzilla movie that connects you with the human characters it has intense and emotional scenes making it a great kaiju film godzillas action scenes were at a whole other level especially considering the 15 million dollar budget i would definitely watch this film multiple times
Dec 6 2023,positive,i would have laughed a few times if i wasnt already crying throughout the whole entire movie
Dec 6 2023,positive,the best godzilla movie in the last 40 years without question and it is not even close godzilla minus one is one of those films that just makes you appreciate storytelling and stays far away from all the political nonsense that is being forced by movie studios today godzilla minus one is an instant classic as director yamazaki knew the assignment and delivered big time bringing back the kaiju king aka godzilla this is the godzilla youve been waiting for and it was spectacularly done on a small budget
Dec 6 2023,positive,1010 movie this was really good and cinematic
Dec 6 2023,positive,i had all but given up on monster movies until i saw godzilla minus one godzilla minus one brought back my passion for monster movies and has proven one thing no one does it better than the japanese when it comes to godzilla their true creation this is an absolute must see and it is an instant classic in my opinion one of the best monster movies ever made and one of the best godzilla movies ever made  this movie truly pays homage to the original godzilla movies  the storyline was very well crafted and tied very nicely together to fit the general story of godzilla  the characters were very well developed all the emotion suspense and thrill you would expect to see in a film like this were there   if you are one of those people that has lost your zest for monster movies and you are looking for the magic that the classic godzilla movies of old had then godzilla minus one will definitely bring you back from the depths of the sea of japan to love godzilla movies all over again
Dec 6 2023,positive,godzilla minus one   97510  because it was later i was tired and felt like falling asleep before the movie started but godzilla from the movie woke me up the rest was history the japanese will always make godzillas attacks feel personal godzilla represents america to japan

Dec 6 2023,positive,one of the best movie in 2023 you could feel the massive destruction godzilla did with great sound and visual effect
Dec 6 2023,positive,after almost 70 years toho studios show that they still have great compelling stories to tell in their godzilla series godzilla minus one was a fantastic film that recalls the big gs origins from the 1954 film an antiwar parable of a creature mutated by nuclear radiation the story is well filmed terrifically acted it has great cinematography a rousing score and impressive special effects for a film that was made for about 15 million it looks significantly more expensive while the bulk of the film focuses on the story and human characters this aspect is so well done and keeps you engaged so that when godzilla actually shows up it has greater impact what you get is an emotional compelling thrilling story about regret survivors guilt ptsd redemption and what it means to be a family not only is this one of the best godzilla films ever made its also one of the best films of the year godzilla minus one is a stunning achievement
Dec 6 2023,positive,totally enjoyed the movie besides having to read sub titles the whole time
Dec 6 2023,positive,you really have to admire the attention to detail from the original tanks never mind if only two units ever saw the light of day to the fighter planes again only two were made to the original destroyerthe only survivor of its line  given to taiwan and the heavy cruiserin real life ignobly sunk as a target ship by the brits
Dec 6 2023,positive,this isnt the standard godzilla film with which we are familiar all the hype is legit anyone can enjoy this film it transcends what it is enjoy it on a big screen while you can
Dec 6 2023,positive,old school perfection even shed a tear or two a human story but with the king with a blast never to be forgotten tokyo will never be the same or will you after seeing this movie 5 oscar material no joke
Dec 6 2023,positive,great movie i might gave preferred a taaad more godzilla screen time      maybe not though its possible that in this case less is more and the time spent on character development was more helpful than more screen time for g     my sensibilities may be skewed from too much hollywood cgi godzilla action overload   sure did like the guy in the suit vibe on this one more than the straightup cgi vibe tho     alsohats off for toho making this for 10 of the typical crappy hollywood versions    really didnt mind the subtitles either  might need to go again this time in imax instead of the projection on the sidewalls theater that gimmick didnt do much for me at least on this movie might be better on a space opera scifi film
Dec 6 2023,positive,this movie is the reason alone i started a rt account and what was missing from oppenheimer primal fear in the face of nuclear power this film recaptured the missing elements of previous godzilla films that inspire both fear and awe the incredible storytelling of guilt passion and redemption was done by incredible actors thoroughly enjoyed every minute of the intense action and drama this is a film worthy to return and share at home
Dec 6 2023,positive,movie is amazing from beginning to end the best godzilla movie ive ever seen
Dec 6 2023,positive,much more than i expected
Dec 6 2023,positive,possibly one of the best movies ive seen easily top 3 the character development the emotional impact even godzilla who wasnt really the main storyline imo but  the story telling magnificent

Dec 6 2023,positive,awesome movie godzilla is king  this movie kicks ass
Dec 6 2023,positive,one of the best movies ive ever seen and possibly the best godzilla film out there every aspect of this movie delivers the acting writing camerawork use of lighting sound and lack of sound  all of it comes together to create an incredible film that anyone can enjoy godzilla fans are rewarded with the use of  as well as the subversion of  tropes that are staple to the franchise familiarity with the series isnt needed to appreciate this film but it can certainly enrich it every second of screen time is used to its fullest the human story is compelling and evocative and the balance of tension dread and relief are expertly handled i have never before experienced a film monster or creature that so effectively instilled a sense of fear and visceral threat godzilla appears as every bit the metaphor he was originally intended to be enriching the human narrative while encapsulating the totality and indiscriminate animal nature of atomic warfare the original creative team would have been so proud and so honored by this work an excellent addition to a 70 year old franchise and when that iconic theme finally drops chills whether youve seen all the films or none at all do yourself a favor and see this one
Dec 6 2023,positive,this movie is so much more than a monster movie at its core lies tragedy and loss on a nuclear level in a post war torn japan if you find yourself rooting for the humans its perfectly okay godzilla minus one is a perfect way to celebrate 70 years of tohojapan and of course godzilla
Dec 6 2023,positive,by far the best of them all  often the human story in the movies is the weakest part  that is not the case here  1010
Dec 6 2023,positive,really really really really really good movie
Dec 6 2023,positive,absolutely phenomenal this is the godzilla film ive wanted to see my whole life i suggest seeing it on the biggest screen  possible i saw it in imax at the metreon in sf and the visuals and sound knocked my socks off this felt like a passion project the acting was sensational characters you care about and the pacing perfect and you see so much of godzilla ive never seen destruction of this scale portrayed so beautifully you can see it all up close with nothing spared i was floored by the execution i stand firm that this is the best godzilla film ever made the bar is now set and i cant recommend it enough 5 stars
Dec 6 2023,positive,its a fantastic movie all around seeing godzilla and being actually scared of him is something you dont see anymore theres a scene in this where 4 men are in a small boat when godzilla shows up it reminded me of a scene from jaws the sound effects blew me away and it has such a great score i cannot believe this movie only cost 15 million dollars go see it

Dec 6 2023,positive,after seeing the early reviews i had to go see godzilla minus one  incredible movie  great with great effects but at the end of the day it was all about the story and the characters
Dec 6 2023,positive,magnificent  hearing the classic ifukube themes was a real thrill
Dec 6 2023,positive,best movie of the year hands down possibly best godzilla ever character development is top notch unbelievable they made this with only 15 million
Dec 6 2023,positive,fantastic saw in 4dx with friends and we had a blast with this one an actual good script with really endearing characters you actually root for an intense story in a crazy setting and of course godzilla himself is just scary     if you dont see this in the theaters you will miss out it was meant for the big screen    1010 better than any hollywood trash ive seen in yearsexcept oppenheimer

Dec 6 2023,positive,this movie is so dope probably going to go see it again in theaters before i cant
Dec 6 2023,positive,besides the dead eyes of the monster this creature looked far better than the american version the oddity is that the mat brodrick version cost of 200 million more yet lacked everything this was entertaining for what it was at just 16 million just wow
Dec 6 2023,positive,this movie really does a great job of portraying how the original godzilla movies were while tying it in with modern effects and top tier storytelling i thought godzilla 2014 was really good but this one blows it out of the water
Dec 6 2023,positive,movie was legit awesome recommend to all godzilla lover hollywood take notes please
Dec 6 2023,positive,easily the best movie ive seen all year a very interesting concept of a kamikaze pilot who did not fulfill his mission is post wwii japan
Dec 6 2023,positive,910  92100   surprised the shit out of me the story especially i didnt think a godzilla movie could have this good of a story and characters especially considering the main character is a kamikazi pilot yet here we are   and dont get me started on that score the og score it hits so hard at the theater during 2 distinct moments and im still feeling the joy from it      sort of a weird theater experience too but only in the sense that before this my father and i also watched silent night so we watch 2 movies at the theater where either little to no talkingenglish is spoken      i know some people aint gonna like it but i hope this eventual trilogy or franchise is put into a deal with the monster verse this godzilla or gojira will be an awesome addition to that universe and for kong and godzilla to go up against
Dec 6 2023,positive,absolutely fantastic the best godzilla movie ive ever seen
Dec 6 2023,positive,a must see for the big screen for new and returning fans of the franchise this movie encapsulates fear in the face of insurmountable odds and the faint glimmer of hope in the darkest times for the first time godzilla is finally portrayed as terrifying i am not usually a proponent of seeing new films in theaters but youre sorely missing out if you let this movie run without seeing it once having godzillas roar echo through your chest is absolute perfection
Dec 6 2023,positive,amazing  the best godzilla movie i have seen to date  it felt authentic if that makes sense  i loved the story lines and the special effects had a natural feel to them  its just a great film to watch
Dec 6 2023,positive,good human story with some fun godzilla action
Dec 6 2023,positive,godzilla minus one just embarrassed hollywood    it would be a tragedy if you didnt watch it because you think you need to be a godzilla fan to enjoy it    im happy to say that this was not only a fantastic godzilla movie but also an absurdly good movie just in general one of the best ive ever seen    i never thought i would see a godzilla movie with this good of a story and believe it or not actually really good human characters that you will actually enjoy as much as godzilla    the story was emotional hit on really good themes and even had some great funny parts without being overly jokey like marvel is now    and then you add godzilla holy crap he has never looked this good or been this angry and there is a lot of him too    and japan did this for only 15 million dollars    absolutely puts hollywood to shame    and for my catholic friends did i mention it promotes good values and is completely clean except for maybe a couple minor curses    as a godzilla fan since i was a kid i couldnt be happier i didnt think a godzilla movie this good on so many levels was possible    easily the best movie of 2023 and the best godzilla ever by a lot
Dec 6 2023,positive,a fresh emotional entry to the godzilla universe
Dec 6 2023,positive,one of my favorite godzilla movies of all time an excellent human plot to go along with an incredible godzilla movie

Dec 6 2023,positive,this film has it all  if i read it correctly the budget was 15 million if so it was well spent  its kind of funny when you see studios spend over 200 million and the cgi looks worse  great film and has heart
Dec 6 2023,positive,what can i say about this masterpiece of kaiju cinema i was left speechless when the credits rolled hell even after this film has everything a monster movie lover needs and then some in addition to the truly horrifying presentation of godzilla and the destruction he wreaks there is a very human story that tugs at the heart and captures all kinds of emotions amazingly hope despair love fear an astounding amount of emotion can be found here and the actors display them excellently the original soundtrack is also an unexpected treat while the movie makes use of the classic ifukube theme much of the movie makes use of original compositions by naoki sato these inspire such vivid feelings of helplessness an overwhelming power hellbent on the destruction of whatever stands in its way and on the other hand tracks like resolution raise you up filling you with hope as the characters are determined to fight and beat this godly force the effects are amazing as well giving us one of the best looking godzilla movies to date while returning to his more classic look as opposed to the charred visage of shingoji this minusgoji is still one of the most terrifying incarnations of the lizard with piercing eyes and tremendously physical performances of strength all together this isnt just a perfect godzilla film its also one of the best films of the entire year another win for goji
Dec 6 2023,positive,best film ive seen in a minute definitely recommend to see in theaters cannot wait for the second one fingers crossed
Dec 6 2023,positive,instant classic nearperfect movie must watch
Dec 6 2023,positive,this is the best godzilla movie since the original i knew the special effects would blow me away but i had no idea the story would be so strong the dialogue was wonderful the acting terrific this movie should be nominated for an oscar as best picture of the year you could take this story about a cowards redemption with its war is not glorious undertones eliminate godzilla altogether and have a tremendous film left its a godzilla film but its also a human story about life and how precious it is
Dec 6 2023,positive,amazing story and cinematography
Dec 6 2023,positive,movie was incredible that all i need to say

Dec 6 2023,positive,this movie is an absolute masterpiece and is very impressive for its low budget if you are a godzilla fan this is a must see the movie take duringaround world war 2 and is supposed to be like the original the story is great the human characters are built well the movie looks amazing and it might make you cry a little in some scenes the best part of this movie is probably godzilla he not only feels like a god but also is a true monster like in the first movie america is only mentioned in this film and never appears on screen but it makes the whole plot of the movie much better overall this is a just about perfect movie and a dream come true for many godzilla fans
Dec 6 2023,positive,a loving tribute to the original movie  well done
Dec 6 2023,positive, this is a spoiler free review   how good was this movie  ask yourself when is the last time you went to a theater and at the end of the movie the audience broke out into applause  the pacing was excellent in a remarkably short time frame they did so much character development  every main character was well rooted and extremely believable  you couldnt help but feel their joys and sorrows throughout the movie  the action sequences were perfectly timed well organized never dragged out for the sake of some cheap gratuitous violence or shock  it all fit together so well i cant think of a single point where the movie dragged  the setup and payoff were so well done and so satisfying  partway in my friend was looking at his phone i was kinda like wft  after the movie i found out it was because of his watch  it monitors his heart rate and it posted an alert basically asking him if he was ok because his heart rate was so high  yea the movie was that kind of edge of your seat exciting  this was clearly patterned after the original 1954 gojira original  and no offense intended to the award winning cinematic masterpiece that the original was but i think this might have been better than even that  go see this
Dec 6 2023,positive,many scenes played homage to the orginals films the modeltoy trains and tanks were perfect thank you toho
Dec 6 2023,positive,the best years of our lives meets jaws meets top gun meets godzilla it was absolutely wonderful heart soul and monster stomping action
Dec 6 2023,positive,awesome movie  better than the american versions classic
Dec 6 2023,positive,just watch it he big lizard 3
Dec 6 2023,positive,an absolute must see movie an engaging post war recovery story mixed with a giant monster flick characters were very well written to the point you dread any time godzilla shows up as his presence will inevitably place them in jeopardy ive never been frightened during a kaiju movie before but the sense of menace this one inspires is truly awe inspiring dont let this leave theaters without seeing it
Dec 6 2023,positive,i loved it this is a true godzilla movie captures the essence of the first godzilla movies from the 50s godzilla was what hes supposed to beterrifying
Dec 6 2023,positive,the story is compelling the computer graphics are superior to a man in a suit    i believe that it is the perfect prequal for an existing 70year series  it made me cry     i think that it is foreign movie of the year
Dec 6 2023,positive,finally a godzilla movie with good characters its a must watch if youre interested in this genre and for a low budget film it blows my mind with what they were able to do great character archs please go see
Dec 6 2023,positive,this is hands down the best godzilla movie and my personal favorite i wouldnt go as to far to say this is the best movie ever made but 1010 as far as godzilla movies go this is an absolute must watch for anyone not just godzilla fans the only small nitpick i could even say is there are some scenes where the animation feels a bit stiff  i can understand majority of people not wanting to sit through a subtitled movie but if you are one of those people please just give it a chance
Dec 6 2023,positive,cant say ive ever really been a fan of godzilla but my god has that changed this is everything a godzilla movie should be from the writing acting special effects character development the score its all perfect the sound design is so immersive and awesome you feel like youre right there with the main characters i was mesmerized throughout the whole film not only with the incredible action sequences and godzillas awesome heat ray but with the characters we get to spend time with in between both honestly equally riveting i didnt want anyone to die even the random patrons in the background and thats because our main characters are so fleshed out they make you feel and really sit with the fact that japan just finished ww2 and now they have a giant monster terrorizing their country and you just cant imagine what thats like but theyre all willing to fight and sacrifice for their families and a better future for japan it was awesome highly recommend the first time we see the heat ray godzilla has wow one of the coolest things ive ever seen on film 
Dec 6 2023,positive,watching this piece of extraordinary japanese filmmaking is the closest ive gotten to the spine tingling delight i received when as a young boy i first saw the original 50s godzilla film on tv but unlike the americanized raymond burrized genesis of the franchise this astounding film draws you in with deep emotions delving into the tragedy that was postwar japan in the immediate aftermath of wwii the characters really matter  for the first time in a kaiju movie  and make you care about how to defeat the nuclearized big bad which in this case is the scariest godzilla ever witnessed onscreen icing on the cake are the music nods to the original especially the excitement of the marchlike musical accompaniment to the creative 1940sera efforts to put a stop to the seemingly unstoppable creature at the end bravo
Dec 6 2023,positive,best godzilla movie you know its a great movie when it makes you love the characters
Dec 6 2023,positive,i really enjoyed the storyline this was a sophisticated exploration of postwar japans state of mind after world war ii godzilla was a commonality of experience and the movie explores the call to action each must answer im a history student so the story was very important to follow even if im a kaiju fan
Dec 6 2023,positive,amazing movie took my whole family and we all enjoyed it 1110 always and forever long live the king
Dec 6 2023,positive,best movie of the year
Dec 6 2023,positive,one of the best movies in recent memory
Dec 6 2023,positive,very good an excellent balance between the kaiju mayhem and destruction we expect from a godzilla movie and human drama and characters we care about would not be surprised if this joins peoples top ten movies of the year or at the very least top three godzilla movies i know it has made both lists for me see it in theaters if you have the chance to you wont regret it
Dec 6 2023,positive,i did not expect this movie to be excellent the story telling and characters were well written i will go see it again its that good
Dec 6 2023,positive,absolute mustsee even if youre not a godzilla fan as a godzilla fan however youre absolutely going to love this feels very reminiscent of the original movie

Dec 5 2023,positive,i love watching this movie  best godzilla movie ever
Dec 5 2023,positive,if you are a godzilla fan 1010 go see this movie  if you are not a godzilla fan 1010 go see this movie seriously  godzilla minus 1 is an a well made film that honors the original 1956 release  similar to the original the movie is about human characters dealing with the insanity of a giant monster attacking and laying waste to their homeland  in minus 1 they are real people you can connect with which shows quality writing considering it takes place in 1940s defeated japan  this is what sets it apart from the recent hollywood godzilla releases where the humans detract from the film every second they are on the screen  minus 1 in contrast has real people experiencing extreme conditions following the war  the pain shikishima deals with connects with the the audience  he is a flawed man dealing with losing everything it is hard not to feel for him  yes this is a monster movie and the humans are adding to the overall film  the monster scenes are shot well the special effects are well done  sound and music score are excellent as well  see this in a good theater with a good sound system    the only caveat is for some people it is in japanese and with subtitles  even so give it a chance after a while you dont even realize you are reading them as you get engrossed in the film  considering the lack of quality films in the theaters lately this one stands out  is it perfect  no i would never say that  but it sure is worth your time and money to go see it
Dec 5 2023,positive,by far the best godzilla movie ive experienced a real story with characters you care about and terrific special effects closest comparison to me was jaws recommend you see it in a theater to enjoy the full experience
Dec 5 2023,positive,best movie ive seen in theaters in years i was fully invested in the human story and blown away by the scenes with godzilla hands down this is now my favorite godzilla movie to date the musical score was spot on as well you could hear a pin drop during the quiet moments of the film and it was a fully packed theater 10 out of 10
Dec 5 2023,positive,the best godzilla movie since the very first imho  this movie was made for the price of a single a listers pay for a single movie in hollywood and is easily 10x better
Dec 5 2023,positive,it is absolutely a blockbuster movie shows the pain and suffering and death of people at the hands of godzilla everything for me was absolutely perfect i watch godzilla in 1962 with king kong and i loved it then this is a cant miss movie thoroughly enjoyed it and it was absolutely spectacular
Dec 5 2023,positive,best movie ive ever seen let alone the best godzilla movie at times godzilla looked stiff and other times he moved too fast and those are my only two gripes about the movie the characters are amazing defiantly a more story driven movie than any other godzilla movie if you like horror giant monster action interesting charters and the original godzilla 1954 movie youll love this movie
Dec 5 2023,positive,best movie i have seen in years great film
Dec 5 2023,positive,im 68 and watching godzilla movies for my entire life  this is certainly my new favorite  i will see it again in the theaters  excellent
Dec 5 2023,positive,fantastic movie the human driven parts were sometimes the best parts and even after spoiling it for myself in advance the movie made me tear up anyways disclaimer to parents while the movie should be appropriate for teens and up there are heavy themes of loss one of the trailers affixed to this film is dirty
Dec 5 2023,positive,its the best godzilla movie ive seen so far for both the special effecst and the human story surrounding it
Dec 5 2023,positive,absolutely incredible not just great as a godzilla movie but an amazing just in general the compelling post war story the emotion the characters potray and make you feel the conflict they portray both internal and physical  you are engaged and invested the whole time it is by far my favorite godzilla film to date and my favorite design for the kaiju i hope there is more to come and it remains at this caliber
Dec 5 2023,positive,not just a kaiju movie the characters are all very compelling amazing special effects and such a beautiful homage to ishiro hondas original vision best movie ive seen in a long long time
Dec 5 2023,positive,wow just wow what a great godzilla flick the best one ive seen perfect mixture of drama action and mushiness loved it
Dec 5 2023,positive,easily the best godzilla movie ever brings the malice of godzilla showing the humanity of postwar japan struggling with the destruction from the americans and the desolation of the wartorn regions  hopefully this can spawn a new sequel and it doesnt even need any other titans this godzilla is the only thing the world needs
Dec 5 2023,negative,not worth watching few good scenes bad actors no plot at all maybe good for the fans of the classic godzilla but not good for all the others
Dec 5 2023,positive,now that is one hell of a good movie i thought i was going in to watch just another kaiju movie in an endless slew of monster movies but no they had to make it a tearjerker story how dare they pull a fast one on me i felt something genuine for the main characters plight and those immediately around him
Dec 5 2023,positive,simply in the top 3 movies of the year heres why godzilla isnt the hero but the bad guy and you route for the characters said characters have depth passion and the courage to make the hardest choices
Dec 5 2023,positive,i thought the story was really compelling with the kamikaze pilot not being able to do his duty during the war and attempting redemption all of the characters were very likable plus ive always been a godzilla fan and it was great to see a japanese version again my husband would have preferred if it were dubbed but it didnt matter to me it was easy to follow the text 
Dec 5 2023,positive,amazing dramatic plenty of action great story telling what more could you want 1010
Dec 5 2023,positive,action from the very beginning  interesting never bored  cant wait for next movie
Dec 5 2023,positive,it was very good i love the background music it sounds like an orchestra the drama was good
Dec 5 2023,positive,it was so amazing watching godzilla chase the humans on the boat was intense the focus on humanity between the lead and his ghosts of regret the natural relationship with his roommate and adopted child the metaphors of the war ptsd building back only to be brought down the classic score mixed with modern score was near perfection  watching this made me feel like a kid playing with my toys back in the day but now as an adult i can see the horror that comes with the devastation several times i watched in awe at what godzilla can do and the devastation he causes to citizens i didnt like the short arms or the way he walked on land but i understood this is classic toho godzilla and though the cgi on land during sunny daylight was noticeable it cant be faulted with such a low budget it excelled at night and in the water overall this movie was beautifully done
Dec 5 2023,positive,godzilla minus one stands out as an exceptional addition to the godzilla franchise earning a resounding 910 in my assessment shikishimas performance as a kamikaze pilot adds depth to the film showcasing his versatility in portraying a range of emotions the connection between shikishima and noriko adds a human touch to the storyline    the film introduces godzilla in a compelling way with a notable powerup that sets the stage for an intense narrative scenes of destruction including a powerful event in ginza deliver the expected godzilla spectacle tachibanas role transitioning from an odo island survivor to shikishimas ally adds an intriguing layer to the plot    godzilla minus one skillfully plays with audience expectations maintaining viewer engagement in the characters journeys the supporting cast including noba the captain and the kid significantly contributes to the overall narrative    what distinguishes this godzilla installment is its meticulous attention to character development and exploration of postwar themes shikishimas internal struggle and the films exploration of life after war elevate it beyond typical monster movie fare the music scoring featuring both original compositions and nostalgic ifukube moments enhances the emotional resonance of the story    the climax involving a daring plan to confront godzilla is executed with precision the films creativity shines through in the use of unique elements during the battle    in conclusion godzilla minus one is a standout godzilla film that combines monster mayhem with thoughtprovoking character arcs the hints at the end leave room for future narratives without diving into specifics i strongly recommend this movie as the best godzilla experience ive encountered its truly an amazing cinematic journey that both godzilla enthusiasts and general audiences should not miss    spoilers and heres my spoiler review      godzilla minus one is an absolute triumph earning a solid 910 in my book shikishimas portrayal as the conflicted kamikaze pilot adds depth to the film showcasing his range in expressing emotions from fear to triumph the dynamic between him and noriko is compelling adding a human touch to the godzilla narrative    the powerup of godzilla with menacing dorsal spines and the imminent threat of his devastating beam keeps the audience on the edge of their seats the destruction of ginza and the subsequent scenes including the powerful explosion deliver the expected godzilla spectacle tachibanas evolution from a survivor on odo island to shikishimas reluctant ally adds an intriguing layer to the storyline    the film cleverly toys with our expectations especially regarding tachibanas escape pod keeping the audience engaged in the characters fates the supporting cast including noba the captain and the kid contribute significantly to the overall narrative    what sets this godzilla installment apart is the meticulous attention to character development and the exploration of postwar trauma shikishimas internal struggle combined with the poignant themes of choosing to live after the horrors of war elevates the film beyond typical monster movie fare the music scoring featuring both original compositions and nostalgic ifukube moments enhances the emotional resonance of the story    the climax involving a daring plan to sink godzilla and the subsequent showdown is executed with precision the use of freon bubbles and co2 balloons adds a unique twist to the battle showcasing the creativity in the films storytelling    the finale delivers an unexpected emotional punch challenging our perceptions of sacrifice and survival the salute as godzillas body disintegrates is a powerful visual moment reinforcing the themes of the film    in the end godzilla minus one stands out as a standout godzilla film blending monster mayhem with thoughtprovoking character arcs the flash of godzilla sinking starting to regenerate hints at the potential for future narratives this movie not only pays homage to the iconic franchise but also pushes its boundaries making it a mustwatch for both godzilla enthusiasts and those seeking a deeper cinematic experience
Dec 5 2023,positive,possibly the best godzilla film ever very well written and acted
Dec 5 2023,negative,i have already seen this movie three times in two weeks i have seen godzilla movies throughout my entire life this is by far the best godzilla i have ever seen it actually has a story behind it heck i even cried in a godzilla movie that never happened to me i have to tell you if you havent seen it please go and tell your friends this movie needs more word of mouth as it is simply one of the best movies of the year and should be recognized as not just a godzilla movie but a great movie ill urge you to see it before it heads back to japan it will not be stream able so go see it in the theaters i promise you wont be disappointed
Dec 5 2023,positive,the story was great and the graphics were excellent   movie is a must see  4dx theatre recommended
Dec 5 2023,positive,absolutely chilling  thrilling the movie had me on the edge of my seat every time godzilla showed up on screen and the story was very compelling definitely something to check out if youre a big godzilla fan  if you havent seen a japanese godzilla film this is also a perfect place to start highly recommend 
Dec 5 2023,positive,when we talk about the historical presence of godzilla we talk about his beginnings this movie is full of intense suspense and emotional dialogue from great visuals to immense sound godzilla minus one is a true gem among all godzilla and kaiju movies what you need to know is that this doesnt just base godzilla in a world war 2 time period its the restart of his new era this movie is so good with characters you can enjoy to follow along and feel for something most godzilla movies dont have then you got godzilla himself a mean nasty and scary force of nature thats out for blood and terrorizes the country of japan alone see it if you can you wont be disappointed
Dec 5 2023,positive,i liked all the action on the movie
Dec 5 2023,positive,even without the godzilla scenes the human drama was good  this film made me cheer for the human side which i rarely do in a godzilla film its primarily because of how wellwritten the human characters are and made me care for them and their struggles  every time godzilla appears he is very threatening and the cinematography makes him scary from a human perspective
Dec 5 2023,positive,movie was a masterpiece the way the music of godzilla was perfect the story line of the humans was perfect unlike the new moviesthe way godzilla was introduced in the start of the movie was so good the way hes introduced as a big scary monster was so good wanted to jump out my seatoverall you wont regret watching this masterclass of a movie
Dec 5 2023,positive,the best godzilla movie in all time a mustsee
Dec 5 2023,positive,the movie is i may or may not have teared up in a couple of scenes good  tackling themes of ptsd found family redemption and japan coming to terms with losing ww2 its one of the best films of the year  im so happy i watched it at the cinema
Dec 5 2023,positive,the movie was absolutely phenomenal especially in imax format  so much action and heart  proof that a well developed story and a monster action can coexist
Dec 5 2023,positive,i absolutly loved this movie seeing godzilla gave me chills with these dead eyes he had the characters and story were well made and i enjoyed watching them interact and develop the visuals were stunning and on paar with the legendary movies deffenetly worth watching
Dec 5 2023,positive,ive seen every gojira movie many times over  ive seen every monster movie produced in japan  this is by far the best one ever made by far good character development great story going back to its roots  i had to watch this in every way possible imax 4dbox and xd amazing
Dec 5 2023,positive,worthy of a watch but not worthy of the hype at times the plot survived on coincidence and the decisionmaking of the characters was questionable in the final chapter of the movie there was a complete indescribable lack of urgency that only existed to help drive the plot the acting was well acting the cgi was really impressive while weak at times the general story kept my interest if anything this is a lesson for hollywood in how to make a decent movie without spending the gdp of a small country
Dec 5 2023,positive,this film is a masterpiece this film is a towering achievement in tokasatsu cinema for fans of kaiju films japanese monster movies this film tops the list of mustsee cinema for those who are not monster movie fans this film has such a heartfelt moving plot that you will not be bored when godzilla isnt on screen this film has the best characters ive seen in a monster movie since the original godzilla film gojira of 1954    like other great films this movie bends genres a little bit this film is a monster movie but its also a family drama a tale of surviving war this movie bends several genres of film into one emotional story that makes the human characters incredibly engaging and godzilla seem down right evil in many godzilla films we find ourselves rooting for godzilla not this time in this film there comes a moment where it becomes clear that godzilla has to be stopped there is a point where godzillas malevolence is so clearly a threat to our characters that you actively root for his defeat    please go see this film in japanese with english subtitles i saw this film yesterday and i plan to see it again before the week is through 1010 greatest monster movie ever made
Dec 5 2023,positive,1010 best movie of 2023
Dec 5 2023,positive,fantastic i would highly recommend it as an entry point for newcomers to godzilla a real emotional story that truly shows the devastating impact godzilla has on the lives of humans beyond buildings being destroyed this is an excellent disaster film on top of being a giant monster movie
Dec 5 2023,positive,this is by far the best godzilla film ive ever seen and its not even close the only thing that could have made this film any better if it was in english even with the subtitles the movie was easy to follow this is the gold standard of how monster movies should be made
Dec 5 2023,positive,this movie has it all great action sequences characters you care about a emotional story and freaking godzilla as his best best godzilla movie hands down
Dec 5 2023,positive,a must see if youre a godzilla fan easily the best since the original

Dec 5 2023,positive,phenomenal film maybe the best godzilla ever  the ginza sequence is amazing great characters you actually care about great storytelling  badass finale  score was excellent too  ill be watching this multiple times in theaters
Dec 5 2023,positive,i have been a godzilla fan since i was eight years old this is the greatest godzilla movie ive ever seen and ive seen them all hollywood better take notice because this movie puts all of the bloated 200 million dollar hollywood godzilla movies to shame it goes without saying godzilla minus one delivers on the special effects and creature carnage levels but it was a refreshing surprise that it also had such a compelling story great characters and amazing actor performances looking forward to future toho godzilla sequels do yourself a favor and see this one in the theater enjoy
Dec 5 2023,positive,this is an incredible achievement  they made me care about a godzilla movie great characters fantastic acting and surprisingly good cgi totally won me over
Dec 5 2023,positive,this was incredible godzilla is a true monster in this not friendly and not ambivalent he hates everything and i love it i want to experience this movie over and over
Dec 5 2023,positive,full of action with a nice story line
Dec 5 2023,positive,once again toho has shown us how godzilla was meant to be i have nothing but amazing words for this movie and i already cant wait to both go see it again next week and for a hopeful sequel
Dec 5 2023,positive,best godzilla movie in decades the visuals were done well on a mere 15 million budget from toho instead of portraying earths savior like in the american versions godzilla goes back to his roots as a terrifying menace for the citizens of japan what really separates this movie from all other kaiju films is the human storyline instead of dealing with science fictional topics such as aliens or creating a basic story with forgettable characters godzilla minus one gives us characters with solid backgrounds and throughout the movie you build an emotional connection with almost every one of them they also tackle very difficult subjects to talk openly about in societysuch as ptsd survivors guilt and depression overall godzilla minus one is a mixture of the original 1954 film with a tone and character arc similar to jaws while also mixing in tidbits of jurassic park all bias towards the godzilla films we grew up watching put to the side this could very well be the greatest kaiju movie of all time
Dec 5 2023,positive,refreshing some plain good cinema
Dec 5 2023,positive,best godzilla film because it has a good solid believable plot and characters with depth  godzilla is terrifying but serves as the catalyst for the koichi shikishima confronting his own war trauma and guilt and cowardice leading to his redemption
Dec 5 2023,positive,see on biggest sceneto be clear i have not seen every godzilla nor foreign film this is not only my favorite godzilla movie ive seen but this is my favorite foreign film ive seen it action packed it felt genuinely terrifying at points and the drama between the human characters is incredibly well written to the point where i got misty eyed multiple times go see this movie in imax the sound alone is worth seeing it on the biggest scene possible
Dec 5 2023,positive,great film it made me care about the characters and godzilla was actually almost scary there was great tension must see movie
Dec 5 2023,positive,it is a surprisingly emotional movie and the focus is on recovering from the war time is spent exploring the motives of the characters and it even has a surprise ending i thought it an excellent movie
Dec 5 2023,positive,wow such an amazing movie  the director did a fantastic job  how they did so much with such a low budget  puts many of the latest marvel movies to shame  a great mix of drama a love story and then the mahem that godzilla brings  one of the scariest godzilla movies out there
Dec 5 2023,positive,no spoilers    my favorite godzilla film by far to be fair i havent yet seen shin godzilla but im extra motivated to now     minus one hits on so many levels and really brings back the magic of the film medium     the alternate history post wwii setting in japan is very much real and alive in the story and you are immediately pulled into the struggles of the recently defeated empire with their own unique cultural and material hardships as experienced through the fantastic cast of compelling characters there are multiple moments where i had realizations that im not used to seeing these stories on film the post wwii japan stories and struggles     this movie is heartfelt and thematically rich     and the monstertruly a monster and a force of nature is a good way to describe him they did reshoot some of the scenes of the first film but also added some new tricks and fresh ideas with innovative moments i especially like that some of the movement of godzilla seemed to be an homage to the original suit movement and it totally worked at other times he does move in a much more menacing and agile way hes fierce     the score worked amazingly and whereas im usually like a corpse watching moviesi actually had some reactions to scenes with this one because it was super easy to react in concern or celebration for the characters     this thing is epic and gripping and i havent ruled out a second viewing this coming weekend
Dec 5 2023,positive,the only reason i gave a 455 rather than a 55 is the occasional overthetop japanese acting made me laugh during serious moments throughout the movie other than that slight detail this is hands down one of the best if not the best godzilla movies ive ever seen
Dec 5 2023,positive,real characters real emotions and monsters
Dec 5 2023,positive,one of the best films ive seen all year the story touches your heart while the action elevates it expertly balanced with humor the film also avoids 99 of the pitfalls shortcuts assumptions and story holes that sink most films of this genre and that atomic breath  oh my
Dec 5 2023,positive,i saw it in japan and was blown away i dont understand why toho didnt market minus one as a remake of the original film which it is theyve updated the metaphor and it really works this is at center a human drama with godzilla there to represent war and regret and guilt and it really works
Dec 5 2023,positive,out of the 21 godzilla films i have seen this is the best one a problem with most godzilla films is that all their human storys suck even some newer american ones but this ones human story is great im glad toho waited until they could really do cgi great because it paid off over all it is a great movie and id recommend this movie to everyone its just that great i saw it at my local bb and im going to see it again at imax
Dec 5 2023,positive,the movie was great i would go to my grandparents house as a kid and would watch the original movies to see it done with modern technology this movie is very awesome you definitely cant get this one confused with the other godzilla movies that out now it stand on it own legs and im all here for it

Dec 5 2023,positive,my goodness one of the best films ive seen in a while even apart from the godzilla part the story and character progression was so captivating then the godzilla part of it was awesome his atomic breath hit like never beforeit was just awesome im actually going to use this movie to incentive my son by telling him if you read more then you will read faster and when you read faster you can watch godzilla minus one
Dec 5 2023,positive,a wwii movie meets godzilla dark and gritty and exciting great characters one of the best movies of the year i was totally blown away
Dec 5 2023,positive,this movie deserves oscars the whole film is not following hollywood s formula yet still amazingly well made a must see film for 2023
Dec 5 2023,positive,never have i seen a godzilla movie have such a well written and heart wrenching human story element usually when you watch these movies your expecting the humans to be the most boring part but for once the humans are the ones that carry this film this movie had heavy themes and shocking moments that recreate the impact that the original 1954 movie brought when it first released this is the original godzilla from 1954 brought to the modern age

Dec 5 2023,positive,this movie was amazing for a 15 million dollar budget toho for sure deserves a pat on the back i didnt mind the movie being in japanese and godzillas design was great the humans backstories were quite cool and it went pretty deep overall rating 4 out of 5 spectacular
Dec 5 2023,positive,most of the poor reviews are complaining  about having to read subtiles  do people not understand this is a japanese film not an american one as an american i found it to be the best action movie ive seen in years minus 1 godzilla is a terrifying force the storyline is engaging and the the characters have substance  godzilla minus 1 is a fantastisk homoge to the original its too bad the people giving it low scores are not intelligent enough to realize its originally made in japan and its a wonder they can type since apperently they cant read

Dec 5 2023,positive,english subtitles did not detract from the movie it was great  took my grandson and gave it a thumbs up

Dec 5 2023,positive,great message great story telling
Dec 5 2023,positive,godzilla minus one was awesome i have to say it has become one of my favorite godzilla movies this is coming from a guy who has seen every godzilla multiple times
Dec 5 2023,positive,in the canon of kaiju films this ranks right at the top not just of godzilla films but a really good movie period the writing acting directing effects cinematography and soundtrack are all top notch
Dec 5 2023,positive,amazing best storyline
Dec 5 2023,positive,this film was entertaining and its godzilla its meant to be a bit silly solid story about the effects of ww2 on japan from a personal viewpoint
Dec 5 2023,positive,this movie was awesome gojira rocks i love that they show him as a younger gojira best picture of 2023 the only thing i thought was lame was the little girls crying it sounded more like a newborn baby not a three year old  it was pretty cool to actually see him eat people
Dec 5 2023,positive,a great movie not just a great godzilla movie a great movie great plot character development cinematography and in the rather over the top japanese style acting godzilla in some ways is a secondary actor in his own movie its the people you care about
Dec 5 2023,positive,incredible allaround great godzilla movieabsolutely one of the best ever
Dec 5 2023,positive,better people section than other godzilla movies  an excellent companion for godzillas parts to shin godzilla  worth a visit to the theatre and to purchase special editions that release
Dec 5 2023,negative,a sequel to shin godzilla this was not the acting was not great most of the time with but a few actors doing a decent job the characters could have been pretty good but their arcs never paid off in a way i felt satisfied by godzilla was not around in much and i know thats often the case in these movies however the really good entries do a great job of keeping godzilla present in your mind and as a source of tension while he isnt on screen spoilers godzilla was too fast and nimble godzilla was surprisingly small for some reason maybe to make it more believable that hed be so fast and nimble the movie was too long with too many scenes with characters i didnt find very compelling the child probably could have been erased from the script to cut some fat off the runtime and make the character motivations a bit stronger spoiler end  i heard in a director interview that the goal was to make the scariest godzilla yet but i was underwhelmed by the design choices for the creature and if they were trying to make the movie itself the scariest yet i wish more inspiration had been taken from shin godzillas visual style   the best part of the movie was definitely the music i just wish it hadnt been wasted on this film as it did most of the heavy lifting i understand its a very japanese film made for japan so i hope japanese audiences enjoyed it and i hope the true fans of the godzilla franchise got something they wanted out of this one but i was disappointed the whole way through
Dec 5 2023,positive,awesome movie love the action and human story
Dec 5 2023,positive,it is a fantastic movie one the best story driven godzilla movies ever made in my humble opinion amazing effects even for a godzilla movie it is a period piece that takes place in post ww2 japan this is where some disconnect happens with american audiences i am of japanese decent and my parents experienced post ww2 japan there were many heart felt scenes that demonstrated suffering with japanese cultural sensibilities that struck a chord with me that left others around me in the audience audibly snickering if you lack empathy for those suffering with ptsd and survivors guilt in other cultures that are not your own then this movie is not for you because it is the primary motivation of the main character throughout this movie
Dec 5 2023,positive,amazing movie there was definitely a few key mistakes in storytelling but man they definitely set the standard for monster movies
Dec 5 2023,positive,godzilla minus one was amazing amazing special effects especially considering the budget great writing this is a monster movie with an actually engaging and wellwritten plot great music etc  this is a wonderful example of what monster movies should be like  best godzilla movie ive seen
Dec 5 2023,positive,it was a good movie but the acting was laughable  the best actor in the entire movie was a toss up between godzilla and the akkiko the baby  everyone else was terrible  good plot good effects and a nice throwback to the original godzilla movies i grew up watching in the 1970s
Dec 5 2023,positive,great story set in post ww2 japan with characters you really care about add fantastic sound design and awesome effects along with classic japanese style and you have a winner 1010 would go see again
Dec 5 2023,positive,without question the best godzilla movie ive ever seen with only a 15 million dollars budget hollywood should be ashamed
Dec 5 2023,positive,one of the best movies ive seen in a long time hollywood might want to shelf its upcoming godzilla movies japan just proved that the genre belongs to them outstanding
Dec 5 2023,positive,what maverick is to top gun godzilla minus one is to the original godzilla lore
Dec 5 2023,positive,great storyline and twist in plot

Dec 5 2023,negative,with monarch and godzilla x kong whats the point of this they couldve at least created an english dub just like how we make spanish dubs
Dec 5 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is absolutely the best shot written and also has the best vfx of any monster movie ever got chills every time godzilla was on screen but the human characters my god the human characters such a beautiful story between them that got me tearing up and hoping the best for all of them truly a ground breaking film and o r of the best of the year

Dec 5 2023,positive,absolutely astonishing beautifully written and shot with tension that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish

Dec 5 2023,positive,awesome godzilla movie go out and see this in theaters
Dec 5 2023,positive,godzilla minus one  just incrediblenot only a great godzilla movie but a damn fine movie overall solid character development emotional story and special effects are superb to the point where youre not seeing cg but a great and believable movie the realism in the godzilla ocean scenes is top notch and the emotions you feel on the human side run deeper than an ocean trench it lived up to all of the hype from the japanese reviews and more not even in the same category as the us monsterverse go see it
Dec 5 2023,positive,it was a very sad movie and was horrifying to watch all those people die in that movie but me and my dad enjoyed the movie in all and it was more than a horror movie scarier than ratedr its more like ratedh for horrifying but again in all it was probably the best movie ive seen so far and it was a deep and real movie and definitely deserves 100 rotten tomatoes and was way better than and most of the movies this year
Dec 5 2023,positive,ive watched loved and rewatched every godzilla movie since i was a kid in the 70s and this is by far my favorite chapter it will be absolutely criminal if takashi yamazaki isnt allowed to grace us with future godzilla movies because this is now the new gold standard this is a must see movie and not just because you like monsters the human story is the very best part of this movie yamazaki is a master of his craft
Dec 5 2023,positive,great story characters and score japan never disappoints with its godzilla films go experience it in theaters now
Dec 5 2023,positive,exceptional spectacular fairytale threading into historical reality thoroughly enjoyable sit back and let it flow over you
Dec 5 2023,positive,ishiro honda would be proud its a story about the horrors of war and how it affects the everyday person that was something hondasan was very passionate about as we see with the first godzilla
Dec 5 2023,positive,toho proves once again that they are the only ones who understand godzilla  a compelling drama with great actors and godzilla is everything he should be  i hope legendary is taking notes
Dec 5 2023,positive,i lived in japan for 15 years and im sure ive seen every godzilla movie ever made but was never truly frightened of the giant or genuinely cared about the characters until seeing this great movie the story is redemptive and gutwrenching warning baby akiko will make you cry   i recommend  seeing this movie at imax the action scenes sound is awesome
Dec 5 2023,neutral,to much story line made it boring but the monster action was good
Dec 5 2023,positive,ive been watching godzilla movies since the 70s this has to be the best one hands down 
Dec 5 2023,positive,well worth seeing again
Dec 5 2023,positive,it was an immersive experience filled with much emotion and detail
Dec 5 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is a compelling post wwii japan period piece that could stand on its own two legs without the titular character kaiju fans fear not as  the king of monsters cements his place on the throne
Dec 5 2023,positive,yamasakis reimagining of godzilla as allegory for personal and collective wartime trauma is a worthy companion to hondas original classic     theres enough spectacle for casual kaiju fans compelling characters for those who arent and plenty of thematic weight for those who want it yamazaki threads a tight needle and succeeds in making one of the franchise as well as of the genre all together
Dec 5 2023,positive,if you require your special effects and acting perfect to western standards this movie isnt for you  it has a ridiculously lumbering and thick godzilla and bad overacting  that being said if you loved the original japanese godzilla movies as corny as they were youll love this   it shares a lot in common with the original godzilla movie   despite its foreign sensibilities that some western audiences my find lacking their are some surprisingly deep and resonate themes at playlike the shame and trauma of a soldier for instance     its a godzilla movie so dont expect every aspect to be logicallike how long it would have taken to attach all those tugboat lines to the warships during the climax  lol   my only complaint  was they broadcast the twist in the ending a bit too much and i would have preferred the less happy version of the ending   but overall loved it
Dec 5 2023,positive,i loved the acting and the plot was a different take its easily the best godzilla movie ive every watched i wish hollywood would learn something from this and start producing quality movies again they wont of course that would be too much like right for them
Dec 5 2023,positive,another absolute masterpiece from toho studios comparable to the original in terms of story and the modern effects are of high quality better than most movies that have come out this year as a diehard godzilla fan i thoroughly enjoyed this film and absolutely loved how the beloved character was remastered for todays audience i highly recommend this film
Dec 5 2023,positive,movie of the year loved every scene almost cried perfect movie
Dec 5 2023,positive,godzilla minus one stands as an unparalleled masterpiece redefining the landscape of monster movies in this cinematic triumph writerdirector takashi yamazaki delivers a modern moviemaking masterclass surpassing any godzilla or monster film emanating from hollywood since jaws toho films under yamazakis helm has elevated the genre exponentially this is not just a godzilla movie its a testament to the potential of genuine character development and storytelling in the colossal world of kaiju hollywood should reflect on the profound impact achievable through true moviemaking artistry dont miss out on the cinematic event of the holiday season gather everyone and experience it on the grandest screen available
Dec 5 2023,positive,great storyline along with action best godzilla movie i have seen
Dec 5 2023,positive,the movie was amazing originally went to see it cause its godzilla but as the movie went on i was pulling for the human characters the story is also amazing best movie of 2023 for me
Dec 5 2023,positive,i am absolutely blown away  this masterpiece is the greatest godzilla movie ever made  and i am a fan of about 50 years this is an epic triumph 
Dec 5 2023,positive,just go watch it dude this movie was fucking amazing
Dec 5 2023,positive,incredible doesnt even begin to cover it what a godzilla movie should be so much meaning to it
Dec 4 2023,positive,not perfect but it was a really good film for a godzilla movie

Dec 4 2023,positive,rivals the very first godzilla movie from 1954
Dec 4 2023,positive,i enjoyed the entirety of this movie the human story was not filler the return of the old godzilla music was a flashback to my childhood and godzilla himself was a monster he was a return to original concept of the bombings in japan
Dec 4 2023,positive,maybe the best godzilla movie
Dec 4 2023,positive,this godzilla movie is best of movie ive ever seen i didnt think the one would make me cry

Dec 4 2023,positive,movie of the year i dont know how you can even top this one  perfection
Dec 4 2023,positive,it was slightly too long by 1520 minutes my only complaint otherwise it was the best movie of the year
Dec 4 2023,positive,wow what a film great story and action  scenes were epic go see
Dec 4 2023,positive,i first became a fan of godzilla in 2014 when director gareth edwards directed the aptly titled godzilla i remember the crowd cheering when the mutos head was taken off by godzillas heat ray so imagine my excitement when i hear director gareth edwards had seen this movie and revealed his thought and it was of envy he wished he had made a movie as good as this one let me tell you folks hes not wrong because this may be the best since the original which is my personal favorite   the 1954 gojira became my favorite godzilla as soon as i saw it and has never been contested until now godzilla minus one is most definitely the best since the original but is the only one that stands to rival it in quality heart narrative acting and themes godzilla himself is at his most brutal and violent in this movie targeting individuals with intent the devastating effects of godzillas rampages are both an awe and terror to behold also lets not forget the modest budget that was less than 15 million yet the film achieves fantastic visuals and set design  i was immersed in this heartfelt somber yet hopeful story ive seen this film twice over now and i recommend everyone to see this film in the cinema as many times as you can not only because its amazing but we need to support amazing films such as this in a time where 300 million plus movies are delivering us subpar quality     in short godzilla minus one is a spectacular blockbuster and my favorite movie of the year
Dec 4 2023,positive,great movie definitely one for fans of the franchise only take away would have liked to see more of godzilla
Dec 4 2023,positive,great fun surprisingly moving and never dull this stands heads and gigantic deadly tails above any attempt at the series by hollywood toho knows what makes these movies work and it hits the stride with only a few cliches to bog down scatted moments highly recommended
Dec 4 2023,positive,i was absolutely blown away by this movie the best gojira movie for me personally
Dec 4 2023,positive,biggest baddest scariest monster ever  shots of a firebombed and destroyed tokyo post ww2 was very good sailors and soldiers had angst on losing the war wanted to make it up by doing away with godzilla great acting  story
Dec 4 2023,positive,one of the best godzilla movies ive seen the human story was compelling and like always we could always see more of the monster butwhen we had godzilla on the  screen we got godzilla  this is the best godzilla ive seen  he looked amazing in this movie
Dec 4 2023,positive,best godzilla movie yet it was terrorizing beautiful and sad all at the same time 
Dec 4 2023,positive,a great movie from toho postworld war two japan had nothing then with the advent of godzilla it goes from 0 to minus one    this movie reached back to godzillas roots it evokes the first movie in theme godzilla is a force of destruction the human story is compelling normally in a kaiju movie i want way less human story and far more monster action that was not a factor in this film     a wonderful film probably the best of the most recent toho movies
Dec 4 2023,positive,absolutely stunning start to finish a must watch for godzilla fans
Dec 4 2023,positive,absolutely best godzilla film of all time i cried twice everything about the movie was so beautifully put together every main character was likable and godzilla truly represents the apocalypse well done toho a true classic masterpiece go see this film

Dec 4 2023,positive,i did not go into this creature feature expecting the beautiful exhilarating dramatic film that i saw what a beautifully written wonderfully acted masterfully directed movie a must see one of the years best films
Dec 4 2023,positive,while godzilla was the undisputed star the story of a young soldier and his found family was gripping and the way that the entire movie called back to the old godzilla movies chefs kiss
Dec 4 2023,positive,wow this is what a godzilla movie should be and more of what godzilla movies were back in the day loved the human side of the story as well it proves that you dont need to spend 100 million to tell a great godzilla story
Dec 4 2023,positive,best monster film ive ever seen focused on the human and historical story rather than on the monster the audience actually clapped at the end of the film feel good without being cheesy
Dec 4 2023,positive,loved everything about it must be seen in original language and in a large theatre we saw it in regal rpx
Dec 4 2023,positive,aweinspiring special effects fantastic musical score excellent look at the effects of war on the human psyche and a nation and last but not least an incredible godzilla

Dec 4 2023,positive,great story so much depth and emotion that makes this film work the visual effects speak for itself
Dec 4 2023,positive,absolutely brilliant a godzilla movie that actually focuses on story and characters while still delivering on heart pounding spellbinding action
Dec 4 2023,positive,perhaps the best in the entire franchise since the 1954 original  i was both surprised and deeply moved by the intricate and powerful human storyline usually the people in godzilla movies are little more than pointandscream fodder or play out soap opera tropes in what is basically padding between scenes of rampage and destruction  in godzilla minus one the characters are faced with constant struggle but manage to endure and there was nary a dry face by the time the credits rolled another great aspect of this movie is the groundview perspective of godzillas attack against the cities  theyre wellrendered to be absolutely terrifying  i went into this movie fearing the franchise had run its course and there was no way to make it fresh and vibrant after 70 yearsbut toho studios has delivered an incredible masterpiece and one that i plan to see over and over
Dec 4 2023,positive,best godzilla movie ever including original  american directors please watch this to know how to make a godzilla movie  they got everything right the story special effects and for us fan boys the king is awesome     for folks that are not godzilla fans i cant say as that is a concept that i cannot fathom
Dec 4 2023,positive,literally brought me to tears at the end 1010
Dec 4 2023,positive,i decided to go along with two friends who are huge godzilla groupies they love the big lizard we went to an early show on sunday morning i wont talk about the 40 minutes of hoopla one has to sit through at regal theatersugh the movie was not what i expected the backdrop is right after wwii you seemingly are taken into a tokyo devastated from the allied bombing the story is immersive and compelling you like the characters the time period is amazing the sets  special effects all add to the story telling this is the best movie i have seen all year im really glad i went i was not expecting it to be this good
Dec 4 2023,positive,so solid as a story screenplay character arcs  we want more of this type of writing
Dec 4 2023,positive,entertaining never saw the first one heard a lot of bad press about it good remake
Dec 4 2023,positive,wow i did not expect the emotional rollercoaster ride with an old fashion monster movie  a true modernization of a classic while keeping to its rootsloved it

Dec 4 2023,positive,this movie was so fing epic best godzilla movie out to this day it was intense from start to finish end of movie audience clap type of vibe recommend watching this moooovie yeah baby much better than what hollywood has been crapping out
Dec 4 2023,positive,literally the best movie ive seen in a long time hands down best godzilla one for sure the cgi may have looked like he crawled out of dragon wars from 06 but holy hell is this a testament to how little that affects the movie when everything else is perfect this should really be taught to the bigger budget directors
Dec 4 2023,positive,one of the best godzilla films to date  its dark gritty emotional and godzilla is more terrifying than ever before  just like how it was in the original film from 1954  i highly recommend it if you havent seen it yet
Dec 4 2023,positive,hey you are just a godzilla movie how come you make me cry     yeah the human side story was so emotional and touching moreover to my surprise the special effects were awesome for this lowbudget movie the acting was impressive and every single detail was put together correctly to make this masterpiece   if you are tired of watching boring american monster movies this is the one for you if you are tired of american love stories this is the one for you it is worth 10 american movies together

Dec 4 2023,positive,nearly a perfect movie
Dec 4 2023,positive,amazing movie must watch
Dec 4 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is incredible cant believe it only cost 15m to make godzilla is like this rampaging angry injured animal that does not have peace  his war is never over      for a split second i thought they were breaking the rules of godzilla and he was eating people  but then he shows that he has no care whatsoever to eat someone and only wants to kill people and destroy stuff  and if there was any doubt he shows it again     beautiful horrible  destruction he is so bloodthirsty that he doesnt think and is hyper focused at times     there is no marvel move bullcrap no annoying comedy relief sidekick no string of quippy one liners during action sequences no one sided politically motivated preaching     just the undeniable truth that war is a totally horrible thing and all lives matter no one is disposable
Dec 4 2023,positive,one of the best  if not the best movie of 2023  godzilla minus one this movie contains many layers  historical culturally romantically and last but not least the best monster and godzilla movie of all time with a budget of only 15 million godzilla minus one looks more like the best 220 million marvel movie this is better than most marvel movies the pacing of the movie is fantastic lots of action sequences that tie perfectly into the story line like pairing your best chocolate and red wine the surround sound makes you feel like you are in the midst of the action my daughter  age 6  was frightened but excited by the sheer magnitude of godzillas force she wants to see it again this is one bad monster move over john wick  there is a new sheriff in town see it on imax
Dec 4 2023,positive,cant go wrong with a godzilla movie a little slow in the beginning but i thought the movie was awesome
Dec 4 2023,positive,theres not much i can add that others have not already said its an excellent movie and you should go out of your way to see it
Dec 4 2023,positive,best godzilla movie ever my one minor nitpick is the rationale for us not being involved in the fight at all as not wanting to rachet up tensions with the ussr i get why as it wanted to focus on the japanese aspect of the movie but the movie was set in 19451947 or 48 in the middle of the american occupation of japan when the us already had tens of thousands of troops stationed there and with gen macarthurs occupation hq smack in the middle of tokyo  think the us wouldve at least sent up a few fighters to harass big g  also japan was demilitarized at the time with no army or navy  however i can get pass the minor historical nitpick and just enjoy the awesomeness of the movie
Dec 4 2023,positive,very refreshing to see godzilla return as a tragic character that embodies the emotion and struggles of postwar japan  this seems to be the perfect mix of human characters that you actually care about story development and great action scenes without going over the top  i have seen every godzilla film at least 3 times and this one is now right up with godzilla 1954 godzilla vs destoroyah and shin godzilla unpopular opinion but its one of my favorites do yourself a favor and see it while its still in theatres
Dec 4 2023,positive,wow the best godzilla film i have ever seen
Dec 4 2023,positive,excellent truly amongst the best if not the very best godzilla movie inventive fresh take on godzilla but more importantly an often unseen in the us at least look at life in japan after the war and what it did to the people there first godzilla movie in a long time i really cared about the characters and wanted to see them not only survive but have a happy ending
Dec 4 2023,positive,first off im not a godzilla fan and not a fan of subtitles and i dont write reviews i feel this one needs some exposer since its so good and im worried people will miss out  this years movie releases have been so bad i hadnt even gone to the theater in 2023 i heard a ton of buzz about this movie and decided to give it a chance i have watched some classic subtitled japanese movies like 7 samurai and it was worth the watch but im generally not a fan of subtitles    back to the point godzilla minus one was a great flick i decided to see it in the theater because ive never seen a godzilla movie on the big screen and i thought the subtitles would be easier to read i was right the theater sounds and the big screen made it heart pumping i dont remember the last time id felt an actual adrenaline rush watching a film the subtitles were much easier to keep up with also and didnt feel like a slog keeping up with the dialog there was young girl with her dad sitting near me and she did have trouble keeping up with the subtitles so keep that in mind if youre taking your kids and theyre maybe not the fastest readers    i think i might have liked the history aspect a little better than the monster but again im not a godzilla fan theres a very good lovehistory story thats integral to the plot i use the word history a little loosely since its modified a bit but generally its correct and would be helpful to know the basics prior to watching the movie the monster is just a force of nature in early postwar japan and the effects were great ive heard theyre practical effects but i dont know if thats true i couldnt really tell so if they are practical effects they did a great job and generally looked better than what hollywood has been pushing out for the last few years plus you actually get to see the monster in good light doing things not cut shots and in the dark to try and make him scary but save money on the effects    id really recommend seeing this its so different than the hollywood godzilla movies its worth it just to see how its interpreted by the nation that created him
Dec 4 2023,positive,it was fine  on the plus side the visual effects were pretty good most of the time esp considering the small budget and godzilla was scary and had personality  the immediate postwar setting of this film lends the metaphor of godzilla more weight and it has an overall uplifting message while being critical of government       unfortunately the human element of the story was excessively melodramatic the movie hides information from you to generate fake tension that none of the characters themselves feel because they know something you dont and plot contrivances abound with characters inexplicably finding each other in chaotic crowded locations that make no sense    it was a completely fine movie but im not quite sure what all the fuss is about
Dec 4 2023,positive,was blown away the ginza scene was one of the best ive seen in any movie the score and story were fantastic definitely worth the price of admission
Dec 4 2023,positive,first godzilla movie i have watched where i was not hoping that it would kill off all of the main characters go figure it is possible to create a godzilla movie without including a bunch of annoying characters who you want dead if this movie cost 15 million to make as it is reported than hollywood is wasting buckets of money on the garbage they have been spewing out for the past decade highly recommend it though you will leave with a renewed appreciation for just how bad such projects as apples monarch legacy of monsters truly is
Dec 4 2023,negative,movie was all in subtitles  terrible story
Dec 4 2023,positive,wow this might be one of the top movies of 2023  outstanding story character development and godzilla is epic
Dec 4 2023,positive,absolutely amazing bettered any expectations i had
Dec 4 2023,positive,the best godzilla movie ever made
Dec 4 2023,positive,best godzilla movie youve ever watched exactly what you hope for when you watch a film like this the massive and explosive action scenes take your breath away and are only matched by the truly compelling story of a man and a nation grappling with the reality of a world post war this movie does it all and in a budget of 15 million hollywood should take notice you could make 16 of these films for the cost of one the marvels
Dec 4 2023,positive,as a life long godzilla fan i can easily say this is one of the greatest godzilla movies to come out absolutely breath taking visuals interesting characters and a phenomenal monster movie nongodzilla fans could watch this movie and enjoy it it is a brilliant film
Dec 4 2023,positive,best godzilla film ever tbh this movie is worthy of getting movie of the year
Dec 4 2023,positive,this is definitely a movie that perfectly represents godzilla as a walking nuclear disaster
Dec 4 2023,positive,i was surprised to find out that this is the classic actor in a rubber suit  great story line from the monster genre and going classic to post ww2 story line  recommend to see this in the theater the feeling of the movie
Dec 4 2023,positive,this movie is a masterpiece nearly everything about it was flawless the story the characters the acting the special effects and godzilla himself the best movie i have seen in 2023 and one of the best overall films ive seen in the last five years few films have moved me emotionally like this one film is supposed to touch us on an emotional level and this movie did that and more
Dec 4 2023,positive,just a great movie they did a superb job in depicting a very ominous and unsettling godzilla
Dec 4 2023,positive,i was entertained the whole time great character story and monster movie as well
Dec 4 2023,positive,i didnt know what to expect and it was refreshing to see a movie with character development and humility you see the desire to stick to the original look of the monster    the one thing i felt was missing was inner motivation of godzilla it serves as an instrument a metaphore    really recommend it
Dec 4 2023,positive,it was a solid after wwii movie with godzilla in it
Dec 4 2023,positive,this film truly understands what makes godzilla a scary destructive monster a movie that for the first time makes huge explosions and destruction feel heavy hitting unlike every michael bay film ever made the stakes of this film are genuinely felt by the audience and the characters are realistic   the film sadly contains some flaws but they can really be boiled down to timing issues that take away from the stakes and inconsistencies in how nuclear bombs work overall this film understands what it needs to be and deliversmy favorite godzilla film by far
Dec 4 2023,positive,great story development great character development wonderful acting classic godzilla scorethere is nothing not to like about this movie
Dec 4 2023,positive,maybe the best godzilla movie ever and ive seen them all  the human story is the best ever in a godzila movie or best since the original   i was in pain with the lead character all movie amazing
Dec 4 2023,positive,absolutely amazing ive been a fan for 25 years now and seen all the movies been a life long fan of the franchise absolutely solid addition to the franchise
Dec 4 2023,positive,human characters are excellent  actually add to the movie making it compelling instead of detracting from it godzilla is a beast  is takes no prisoners he is the monster  its awesome
Dec 4 2023,positive,great movie 1010 i like the story and godzillas look is amazing cant wait for a sequel
Dec 4 2023,positive,one of the best godzilla movies and the human story was amazing pus godzilla was terrifying
Dec 4 2023,positive,what a great throw back to godzillas grumpy days the feel and the look was so similar to a horror movie godzilla was so menacing and angry a great allegory for the time i was glad to share this cinematic story with my younger brothers
Dec 4 2023,positive,making a godzilla movie the creates emotional involvement is no small feat but this movie succeeds i mainly went because of the wide array of positive reactions and i wasnt disappointed tremendous effects but a very human heart good flick reminds me of the original
Dec 4 2023,positive,it is one of the best movie ever made and the best movie of the year
Dec 4 2023,positive,excellent and even intense in parts acting was really good and the story was a lot smarter than the last 2 monsterverse movies if you like godzilla at all you will love this movie i have seen it twice already with my kids who also loved it
Dec 4 2023,positive,it was the best godzilla movie yet  my only complaint is that it wasnt in english  i was ok with it but my 8 yr old who is a godzilla fanatic isnt that fast of a reader so i dont think he followed along too much but he did say he really liked it
Dec 4 2023,positive,godzilla minus one 2023 is a great kaiju film and a worthy addition to the godzilla franchise it is a respectful and nostalgic tribute to the original godzilla film and also a fresh and modern take on the genre it has a strong and emotional story a likable and relatable cast a majestic and menacing godzilla and a stunning and realistic visual effects it is a film that appeals to both fans and newcomers of godzilla and it is a film that celebrates the 70th anniversary of the franchise it is a film that deserves to be seen on the big screen and it is a film that will make you feel a range of emotions from fear and awe to sadness and joy it is a film that will make you think and feel and it is a film that will make you appreciate the king of monsters
Dec 4 2023,positive,lovely film with a big scary monster
Dec 4 2023,positive,great movie human characters were compelling and welldeveloped loved the post wwii tokyo setting and the characters struggling to cope with the shame of listing the war and the struggle to rebuild and move forward also godzilla was a truly terrifying force off nature those atomuc blasts  only negative was that i would have liked a little more of godzilla destroying tokyo but what you get is truly win done 
Dec 4 2023,positive,loved the movie but guest in the theater were loud and would not stop talking
Dec 4 2023,positive,i guess you could call me a gfan and if you too are a gfan then you too must watch this movie    of the 38 godzilla films out there japanese  us ive seen 36 but i own them all and have for a while now most gfans know shin godzilla 2016 was a high point for the toho godzilla films we really wanted to see a sequel come off of that reboot for the franchise well toho had other ideas and decided to make minus one instead     this film plus godzilla x kong the new empire sort of makes up the 70th anniversary of the godzilla franchise along with the apple tv monsterverse series    this movie had a significantly smaller budget than youre used to not only for a godzilla movie but for movies in general 15 million is difficult to fathom in modern times and for the most part the movie looks very competent shin godzilla 2016 had set the standard for japanese godzilla film effects but minus one bests it    this film also has a much smaller scope than youre used to for a godzilla film but for me was a good point arguably when of the best human stories ever for a gentry this also go well with a miniscule budget and this time you actually care for the protagonists    at 2 hours 10 minutes this exceeds the typical kaiju sweet spot of 90 minutes to 1 hour 45 minutes there were some quietdialog scenes that dragged a little for me and for the first 2 thirds most events were fairly predictable what i was not expecting were developments that came in the third act which i will not spoil    the score utilizing the iconic og godzilla theme is off the chain most of the movie is not booming loud but scenes featuring the original theme blew me away sonically and then some    as a nice chaser if you are also a gfan of the legendary pictures monsterverse movie i would also recommend the apple tv monarch legacy of monsters series    my quickie review on this movie and more can be found on our movie review podcast prognosis negative wherever you listen to podcasts    
Dec 4 2023,positive,an absolutely wonderful blend of emotion cgi and weight this film brought absolutely recommend for anyone not just long time godzilla fans
Dec 4 2023,positive,just like the original godzilla this movie explores the horrors of war unlike most godzilla films it has amazing human characters that allow the story to flourish i love how scary they made godzilla a must watch for any kaiju fan
Dec 4 2023,positive,godzilla minus one really surprised me  ive never been a huge fan of godzilla movies or that genre  however i may rewatch some of the older godzilla movies thanks to minus one  this movie was excellent it was a highly enjoyable experience  i like that the movie explored a couple of interesting themes besides mayhem and destruction  which was also fun  the godzilla monster also looked incredibly epic
Dec 4 2023,positive,absolute masterpiece    this is what godzilla is in the minds of so many fans
Dec 4 2023,positive,i went expecting a good old campy monster stomp and in the old tradition and instead i got an intensely emotional humanfocused story about the japanese experience of defeat after wwii survivors guilt a chance for redemption and the choice to live  the story was set in the ruins of japan after wwii when their country had been largely destroyed but their society had not and it used the experiences of a failed kamakaze pilot as a proxy for the entire nations struggle to redefine duty and purpose in the new era  the existential threat of godzilla was a chance to prove that japans people could stand on their own even against a creature that clearly represented echoes of the countrys very real nuclear trauma  one of the most satisfying parts of the film was the very clear character arc that the main protagonist goes through which included sensitively portrayed moments of ptsd and the importance of relationships in recovery and life purpose  i cannot praise the writing casting and acting highly enough this was without a doubt the best film i have seen in a very long time  both my buddy and i got up from our seats tearyeyed    there are five things that potential viewers should keep in mind   1 this a japanese film about japanese people having an experience in a distinctly japanese historical and cultural context  its not diverse it generally doesnt have an agenda and it does not apologize for the story it is telling  if you need your stories steeped in caveats and humble acknowledgements of tribal land the patriarchy imperialism or whatever else occupies people these days this is not your cup of tea  its a serious story about realistic people not a university kumbaya session  2 the version of the film i saw and to my knowledge the only one was in japanese with english subtitles  this doesnt bother me at all i would rather have the real acting and voices with subtitles any day of the week  some people dont feel the same though so if you really cant handle subtitles then this may not be for you  although i really suggest you put in the effort so you can watch the seven samurai and the hidden fortress  3 the budget for this film was not large and if youre expecting special effects on par with a 250 million usd disney blowout youre going to be disappointed  it was obvious that nearly every wide shot especially the ships was entirely cgi  if youre a stickler for the most believable visuals and any doubt of realism ruins your experience that might be a deal killer  that said because the special effects existed in service to the plot and not as the centerpiece of the film they were absolutely good enough  hollywood take note if your writing and acting is good you dont need to spend the gdp of a small country on asset creation and rendering  4 in certain parts of the film they made liberal use of lowfrequency sound to amp up the drama and anxiety of a scene  legit strategy but it seemed a little overused sometimes where i felt silence would have been better  on the other hand it made the silent parts of the film more impactful by contrast so maybe they made the right choice  5 this story is far better if you have some understanding of japans experience in the prior century leading up to wwii so you understand the context  if youre interested in that i recommend you take a look at dan carlins supernova in the east episodes part of the hardcore history podcast  if youre willing to put 30 hours into the learning process you will be rewarded with a great appreciation for what japanese people went through and the forces shaping japanese thought in that period
Dec 4 2023,positive,this is by far and away the best version of the godzilla franchise that i have seen in a very long time in fact even better than the 1950s classic original the key is the wonderful human element added the plot is just as much about one mans redemption as it is about godzilla on a rampage another original aspect is the timeline this version of godzilla is post world war 2 in a devastated japan what an original plotline a kamikaze pilot loses his nerve and who could blame him and guides his plane to a repair facility on an island claiming mechanical failure with the plane then godzilla appears on the island and starts squashing the solders like bugs this haunts the pilot and causes his own personal war       now lets talk about the monster i love this version of godzilla this is not a version that wants to protect humans this godzilla wants to squash humans and cause general destruction and chaos an evil fiend indeed like a mindless zombie who just wants to feed godzilla just wants to destroy fantastic effects as well very realistic in the destruction scenes       how godzilla was eventually rid of is one of the more original ideas in this type of genre  the only reason i did not give it a full 5 stars is mainly i thought the pilot played by ryunosuke kamiki had a serious case of william shatner overacting     otherwise the best godzilla movie i have ever seen could save the franchise
Dec 4 2023,positive,this movie was genuinely terrifying not only was it one of the first godzilla movies where we actually cared about the main characters who arent giant lizard monsters but it provided one of the best casts of characters i have seen in a new movie in a while it goes to show that with good writing good acting and a good message a low budget cannot stand in the way of a good movie
Dec 4 2023,positive,amazing while i didnt think the ending was that believable with some of the characters it made me happy that it happened anyway
Dec 4 2023,positive,is this how movies are in japan i have to look more into that it reminds me of movies made back in the 80s when they spawned beloved franchises they are failing to remake 40 years later
Dec 4 2023,positive,i went in to this thinking most movies suck and godzilla minus one has to be at least average if nothing else boy was i wrong i felt fear and realism and impending doom that i could not escape from for the entire movie the people factor felt right and real for once the heat ray attack it had everyone in the theater gasping and speaking holy cow the first time we see it and we laughed at the insanity of its power every time after great movie and i al planning to see it again here just two days removed from the first viewing
Dec 4 2023,positive,this is easily one of the best godzilla movies since the original i have been a life long fan of godzilla i have seen them all even the 97thing no other godzilla to date tugged on my emotions like this one the big g has not looked better or more menacing i hope everyone gets the opportunity to go see it
Dec 4 2023,positive,man this movie was intense the human subplot to this movie will get you
Dec 4 2023,positive,it was really great with a more character focused story its really brings out the horror and scale of godzilla bringing it back to its roots with amazing action and a heartfelt story it is easily the best godzilla movie since king of the monsters
Dec 4 2023,positive,the movie was amazing  the characters were well developed and their back stories were compelling  you almost forget you are watching a godzilla movie  the fact that the movie was made for 15 million dollars is testimony to good story telling  not that the effects were lacking  they were everything you wanted in a godzilla movie
Dec 4 2023,positive,this film was fabulous  not only was it a monster movie but it was one that focused on depth of character of the key people  it had a great storyline and was exceptionally well written  i really felt for the characters and it seemed like i was there in the movie with them  this was the best movie i have seen in years  highly recommended
Dec 4 2023,positive,great movie  saw it twice opening weekend  great storyline and the subtitles were timed perfectly my only concern is why noriko was the only one with radiation signs and not shikishima when he had more exposure  we really enjoyed the movie
Dec 4 2023,positive,bare bones review to avoid spoilers i normally dislike romancehuman drama in my kaiju films but godzilla 1 made me actually care about these people  the humans were definitely the center of the film godzilla seemed very much the b plot unless he was actively stomping around and wow on the one hand the model on land seemed very clunky little to no mobility with teeny tiny arms but on the other it had presence  like yes godzilla cant do a backflip and is walking with a train dangling from his mouth like a dogs chewtoy but that slow forward momentum was unstoppable    and as previously stated the humans and their own internal struggles are the heart of this movie  i especially loved the doctor who came up with the plan to stop godzilla which seems very pieinthesky but movie logic because he reminded me of my uncle
Dec 4 2023,negative,i was disappointed because godzilla was only in it for a very short time and he was not the focus it was a war character drama godzilla could have been swapped with any monster or enemy theres no lore or personality for godzilla
Dec 4 2023,positive,def the best godzilla movie
Dec 4 2023,positive,amazing movie definitely a must watch it is in subtitles but if youve watched anime then you should be fine
Dec 4 2023,positive,best godzilla to date loved it  highly reccomend 
Dec 4 2023,positive,fantastic movie that made me care about the human characters while giving me a good solid dose of godzilla in his original force of destruction mode
Dec 4 2023,positive,best thus far way better that the american version not always about monster fight a little bit of drama romance and action suspense great story to the movie
Dec 4 2023,positive,amazing proper godzilla i have to admit to being a massive godzilla fan since the 80s and maybe i love this movie because it really takes us back with the original origin story i feel the more current monsterverse american godzilla movies are good but this is just back to roots proper godzilla it has incredible sound and it is a very good human story i hope we see more japanese godzilla and a wider theatrical release in the future so more folks can experience this masterpiece
Dec 4 2023,positive,this is a great monster movie that really got me excited to see godzilla every time he is on screen and has me caring for the people and their struggles of what they are facing within and the environment around them during this crisis and the theme of godzilla is still stuck on my mind
Dec 4 2023,positive,a return to the glory days of godzilla recapturing the feel and look of the big g a chefs kiss to the original 1954 movie be prepared to enjoy a cast of characters that embody a post war japan a riveting addition to the godzilla franchise
Dec 4 2023,positive,good movie i wish there was more godzilla and less love story but really liked the movie moved at a good pace and godzilla looked awesome
Dec 4 2023,positive,amazing movie great story
Dec 4 2023,positive,this movie is the realio dealio
Dec 4 2023,positive,a movie to be experienced not watched  great story cast and cgi  in an tense moment in the movie audio disappears the audience is dead quiet too as they are riveted by godzilla 10
Dec 4 2023,positive,such an awesome movie godzilla was truly terrifying
Dec 4 2023,positive,my only regret is not seeing it in imax the first time compelling story and human characters that you get attached to  godzilla presents himself as essentially the atomic bomb made into a monster incredible imagery and sound design
Dec 4 2023,positive,great story well paced great acting awesome action true to the original godzilla i loved the movie
Dec 4 2023,negative,it was nostalgic at least but man was that a poor excuse for a story line and it was so slow to get any traction
Dec 4 2023,positive,by far one the best films this year great action great story i was crying laughing cheering in shock a rollercoaster of emotions with an awesome payoff this movie is a must watch and for sure movie of the year
Dec 4 2023,positive,i think this is the best godzilla movie yet great pacing great acting great characters good balance of humor godzillas time on the screen surely did not disappoint
Dec 4 2023,positive,its probably the best movie in theaters in about 5 to 10 years this movie is something that you will probably want to see more than once more than twice  probably 5 times if you can imax is a must it will have you on the edge of your seat the build up to the climax is the equivalent of marvels phases 123 to infinity war and endgame in just 2 hours instead of years you will probably feel an obligation to both watch it multiple times and tell everyone you know to see it multiple times if people knew how good this movie was it would make more than infinity war and endgame combined and it deserves to i am begging you to go watch this do yourself the favor you will probably tell everyone the same thing
Dec 4 2023,positive,powerful emotional movie really encapsulates godzilla being a metaphor for war and all the difficult decisions soldiers and civilians have to face during wartime really strong story about family honor and the sanctity of life the only modern godzilla movie worth watching
Dec 4 2023,positive,they made me love and care for the characters in a monster movie i did not expect this much feels well done i can re watch this movie multiple times
Dec 4 2023,positive,amazing story great reboot to a classic character by far my favorite godzilla and atomic breath
Dec 4 2023,positive,best movie of the year
Dec 4 2023,positive,long time godzilla fan here and i have to say this movie was a surprise for me  it was a wonderful mix of human drama and perseverance in the face of a new and terrifying threat  my hats off to the director cast and crew for bringing me back to my childhood and the wonderment and awe that is godzilla
Dec 4 2023,positive,one of the best godzilla movies ive ever seen im a huge fan of the franchise and have watched most of the movies this was definitely a modern take on the monster i was glued to the screen from the first moment i even took my girlfriend who i thought wouldnt like it she cried multiple times in the movie and never stopped watching
Dec 4 2023,positive,this was awesome best movie of the year hands down no exceptions
Dec 4 2023,positive,better than anything hollywood has put out in years weird how i could relate to the characters even though none of them look like me which is what hollywood thinks has to be in every movie just make a movie and a cohesive story and you will succeed
Dec 4 2023,positive,probably the best godzilla footage ive seen
Dec 4 2023,positive,the best toho godzilla movie ive seen way better than shin godzilla the human characters were great
Dec 4 2023,positive,i think this is the movie of the year i have never seen a godzilla movie before and i went with my dad who has seen every single one several times it was extremely enjoyable
Dec 4 2023,positive,i just watched godzilla minus one in 4dx with my daughter who hates war time movies and even she gave the movie a 9 out of 10     i think its the best movie this year and one of the top 5 kaiju  films of all time
Dec 4 2023,positive,this was a great film not just a good godzilla film but an overall enjoyable experience the characters and storyline drew you in as audience member and you couldnt help but root for them well put together suspenseful and thrilling
Dec 4 2023,positive,i love the human aspect and godzilla is just a force of nature
Dec 4 2023,positive,saw this as a group of 3 men aged 16 45 55 full price tickets at an ok theater with food  drinks all regular adult prices godzilla minus one is easily one of the most fun popcorn movies in recent years it is teriffic fun to see godzilla stomp his way across the big screen in big earthshaking dolby surround but this movie is actually a good movie in its own right i cared about the characters and rooted for them the writing acting and special effects were three or five cuts above the cgi content flushing out of the mouse house tons of destructable models and old school rubber suit stuff fun to watch and technically well done godzilla was a monster of a main character in his own movie not an afterthought we got to see him in seriously terriffying full size in good light with full body shots and closeups just awesome the movie was just over 2 hrs long in japanese with english subtitles we were hooked in the first few minutes time flew by and the subtitles were fine to watch bottom line godzilla minus one is a popcorn movie worth every penny no hidden agenda bs no politics and every full price ticket supports all the great people at toho who made this masterpiece on a shoestring budget with just sweat equity and a love for godzilla movies loved every minute will pay full price to see this again with my grown kids later this month in an mx sound theater if possible go to the theater with a friend and have a great time encourage people to make great movies like this again
Dec 4 2023,positive,true to origins  excellent plot  well done
Dec 4 2023,positive,absolute genre defining masterpiece will make you cry will make you feel fear grabs a hold of you in the beginning and takes you on a ride go see this movie you may never see another like it in this lifetime
Dec 4 2023,positive,absolute cinema thought it was going to be just another cheesy monster movie and while yes godzilla is definitely the reason i saw it the human characters gave the story so much weight theres meaningful character growth in multiple characters that are dealing with themes of ptsd survivors guilt acceptance forgiveness loss hope despair this movie will make you feel feelings its also a legit disaster movie and is not afraid to pull any punches people die horribly and those that dont have to deal with that fact there are many parallels with the original gojira but visually updated for 2023 without looking like a video game not a depressing movie at all but at the same time if you go into it expecting the cheesy camp from some earlier godzilla titles you are in for a rude awakening highly recommended go see it as soon as you can
Dec 4 2023,positive,loved almost every aspect of this  godzilla was actually rendered in a way that his presence really was menacing setting it in postwwii japan was a great choice the backstory of the main character was compelling and i was totally engrossed even when godzilla was no where to be found
Dec 4 2023,positive,best movie of 2024
Dec 4 2023,positive,by far the best adaptation of godzilla this movie is a rollercoaster of emotions that will have you wanting more
Dec 4 2023,positive,so so good  not the typical godzilla movie  great story line outstanding acting  hope its nominated for the japanese production
Dec 4 2023,positive,the best godzilla film ive seen the story the action and the horror it all blends in so well
Dec 4 2023,positive,better than the last three godzilla movies please make more godzilla movies like this
Dec 4 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is one of the years finest blockbuster films and quite possibly the best godzilla film i have ever seen this is a movie that understands how to create an emotional attachment to characters and thus raises the stakes when the action is going down speaking of the action it is some of the most spectacular stuff you can see in a theater in 2023 this movie is pure entertainment and has plenty of heart and a good story to me it feels like it captures the soul of the original film and flourishes it with modernday special effects and it reminded me a lot of the 2005 king kong film in that way overall this is a thrill ride that has plenty of moments to wow the audience while also remembering to tell a genuinely engaging human story
Dec 4 2023,positive,godzilla is back in true form wonderful movie
Dec 4 2023,positive,this is the best godzilla movie ive ever seen and its because of the attention to detail in building the characters through important emotional moments their journeys are everything the film is also a great vision of postwar japan that movie audiences rarely get to see american audiences might have objected to seeing the devastation that the japanese people had endured as a result of american attacks on their homeland but in this new century were in now everyone loves japan and were ready to see their story godzilla itself is a kind of avatar of nature enacting vengeance for violence against the natural world in this genre but but this film also uses the monster to help the audience to empathize with japanese victims of war all the moments are wellearned the monster is truly furious and terrifying effects and cinematography are great and theres also an adorable baby i highly recommend this movie
Dec 4 2023,positive,minus one is the biggest experience i had with a godzilla movie everything is outstanding beautiful and also very tragic its about the human will to face the worst possible situation happening at the worst time possible the characters are awesome with deepness reflecting the horrors that the japanese people lived through post ww2 embodiment by the creature that is tearing everything apart and criticizing both the japanese and us government decisions smartly even if you are not a godzilla fan this is a must watch
Dec 4 2023,positive,hands down the best godzilla movie ever it clicks on all cylinders  story acting direction and sfx the japanese monster movies have always had a subtext of the national trauma of hiroshima and nagasaki by setting this story at the end of the war and making the central character a traumatized japanese soldier the film moves the subtext to the front brilliantly and for the first time i can remember the monster itself is terrifying kudos to toho studios for making a film light years ahead of anything else they have ever done

Dec 4 2023,negative,this movie is so overrated the movie is more about a kamikaze pilot overcoming his ptsd than it is about godzilla godzilla is barely in the movie if this movie was made 1020 years ago i would be impressed godzilla was a mechanical robot or someones old granny who could only take one step at a time the only fluid movement was when he was in the water this movie was horrible
Dec 4 2023,positive,came in to the movie expecting a normal monster movie was surprise how invested i got into the human characters great writing and filming love this movie

Dec 4 2023,positive,i loved this movie it is way more than just another godzilla movie the movie intertwines a lot of stories related to post war japan around the threat of godzilla the japanese language version with subtitles was very appropriate and gave a great flavor to the movie i rate it as the best godzilla movie ive seen at the end of the movieeveryone in the theatre applauded which is reallly something for a foreign language movie reaction from an american audience
Dec 4 2023,positive,a harrowing tale enveloped in themes of foreboding death and surviors guilt    while the monster is villainous and threatening the true antagonist is a perfect balance of self doubt and worthiness     an amazing movie that must be seen in a theater ironically for a scene with no sound that will loom with you well after the credits roll

Dec 3 2023,positive,although the movie has a lot of dramatic dialogue it still gave all godzilla fans a taste of the king of the monsters
Dec 3 2023,positive,awesome godzilla film great homage to the original 1954 gorjira
Dec 3 2023,positive,awesome classic godzilla movie riveting characters too
Dec 3 2023,positive,just wow i am not even a kaiju movie fan and i loved this
Dec 3 2023,positive,this has to be the best godzilla movie ever the sound the pacing the lighting in every shot is top notch  we get to see the destruction in a wide shot and it shows how scarry this beast can actually be  when the spirit of the movie is allowed to shine without anything else in its way you get a fantastic move like this  you could watch this in your home but the theater is where this movie shines  go see this movie you will become a fan of the genre the moment the credits roll  10 out of 5

Dec 3 2023,positive,at 15 million this tops any 200m blockbuster this year with a less is more approach to storytelling with a human focus this is probably the best godzilla film in the 70 year franchise this is a film fans and a general movie goer could appreciate its not a nonstop marvel cgi action fest but when the action does start it is exciting amazing visuals and tense action make this a must to see in the largest format theater you can with 4dx and imax making this an incredible experience that only a cinema can deliver

Dec 3 2023,positive,is perfect i loved it
Dec 3 2023,positive,fantastic origin story  excellent effects great acting couldnt ask for more
Dec 3 2023,positive,excellent movie hollywood should take notes on how to create a monster movie from this the human element and characters made you feel what they were feeling you actually care for them and what happens to them characters are flawed and not the unlikeable perfect invincible strong characters that hollywood seems to be pumping out lately there is actual tension when godzilla shows up due to these stakes unlike hollywood godzilla movies the focus is not just on the monster alone and special effects galore there is an actual good story here there are people that you care about in the film that you get attached to the characters are actually likeable and relatable throughout
Dec 3 2023,positive,great godzilla movie from a life long godzilla fan
Dec 3 2023,positive,great story godzilla its self at times looked a bit goofy but overall very good action and the ray blast from godzilla was epic
Dec 3 2023,positive,this movie was better than i excepted it to be and i already had high expectations it was an amazing movie with plenty of emotions and action
Dec 3 2023,positive,a great homage to the 1954 original with its own uniques twist in its story characters are well written and ties in nicely with the story and makes godzilla all the more horrifying that said acting is a little over done at time cgi is excellent for most of the film there are some cheesy stylistic choices that make me favor the legendary godzilla over this one but those are far and view between overall great film to see in imax
Dec 3 2023,positive,amazing i cried so much  the way you get so emotionally attached to the characters the actors where fantastic must see in imax
Dec 3 2023,positive,yamazaki has created the greatest godzilla film known to date the cast is amazing godzilla is terrifying and the story is amazing overall a great film
Dec 3 2023,positive,i never thought id rave about a story in a godzilla movie but here we are the first movie in the toho series in a long time where ive actually cared about what the humans are doing great action sequences memorable characters and probably the best on screen godzilla in the franchise shin godzilla had some incredible sequences but minus one tops every single one    this movie rivals the original for me and i do not say that lightly i truly hope toho continues on from this movie to spawn a new era of godzilla
Dec 3 2023,positive,a true godzilla film that is even better than the original takashi yamazaki did a splendid job delivering an emotional story with such great actors you will be inspired
Dec 3 2023,positive,wow just watched it and such an emotional movie who would have guess that from a godzilla movie probably the best godzilla made and this godzilla was scary

Dec 3 2023,positive,very good acting awesome atomic breath buh buh buh buh
Dec 3 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is absolutely fantastic   they give you characters that you actually care about deal with themes of loss grief and guilt particularly survivor guilt in a powerful way and the effects are absolutely first rate the fact that anyone could make a film this good for only 15 million is unbelievable   the movie is a period piece taking place right after the end of world war 2 and transforms the theme of the original gojira 1954 from a story about the horrors of atomic weapons into a story about the horrors of war in general  definitely see this movie on the big screen if you can its well worth it
Dec 3 2023,positive,a great movie i dont mean that as greatforagodzillafilm with actual investment into its characters the movie creates an excellent balance of character development plot and the titular monster legendary needs to look toward this movie and see why people will always go to the classic model answer its a great blend of storytelling and balance one of the best films of 2023 easily

Dec 3 2023,positive,loved it even got misty eyed i was totally invested in all the characters this was more than just a godzilla movie best one yet 
Dec 3 2023,positive,quite possibly better than even the original 1954 classic godzilla is brutally frightening and the story puts real stakes for our human characters godzilla is best when he is an allegory and this hits it out of the park
Dec 3 2023,positive,wow what a movie great post war storyline and for a production budget of 15m it was just amazing if you are a godzilla fan its a must see at the theaters
Dec 3 2023,positive,awesome so much better than what hollywood pumps out you actually care about the characters and what happens to them great storyline
Dec 3 2023,positive,it made me crylaughfrustratedrelieved uncomfortable and yet comfortable at the same time this was prime cinematography and just prime og godzilla it took me back to the feeling when i first watched it with my dad when i was about 4 was it the best movie of the year to some yes but definitely not to all but over all its 1 of my favorite movie of all time this was amazing just hope the give us a little more godzilla next time

Dec 3 2023,positive,liked everything  disliked nothing
Dec 3 2023,positive,great plot great characters monster looked awesome lots of drama a
Dec 3 2023,positive,this was the best movie ive seen in a long time there was nothing in this movie i didnt like i was on the edge of my seat
Dec 3 2023,positive,a very well acted reimagining of the classic godzilla story
Dec 3 2023,positive,incredible good writing great story and characters couple of clunky godzilla moments but with the low budget i find that still impressive hopefully with the success then next movies will have a higher budget
Dec 3 2023,positive,this is honestly one of the best movies ive seen in a very long time go see this in imax if you can before it leaves theaters please keep this in theaters longer amc ill buy more tickets i promise

Dec 3 2023,positive,amazing movie great story effects one of the best godzilla movies ever
Dec 3 2023,positive,i am very surprised how much i liked it i totally approve of yet another godzilla remake 
Dec 3 2023,positive,the perfect godzilla movie
Dec 3 2023,positive,this is a top tier movie like real dont spoil just recommend this is the best film ive seen since the matrix so many years ago i cant believe a monster flick could be so good
Dec 3 2023,positive,awesome kaiju movie with not only plenty of action and special effects but also a well done human drama surrounding it  the only detractor for me was the somewhat stilted way that godzilla was animated when hes walking but otherwise it was absolutely a fun ride with several emotional moments
Dec 3 2023,positive,i love this version its awesome
Dec 3 2023,positive,movie was absolutely amazing puts anything hollyweird has made recently to shame
Dec 3 2023,positive,70 years have been building to this minus one stands as not only the best godzilla film but likely the best in the genre all elements in this film come together in perfect harmony from the animation so good at times youd swear godzilla was real to the music to the outstanding cast the writing is what really makes this movie godzilla action is always fun thats why this franchise has survived for 70 years but all previous films have suffered from characters who are boring and in some cases downright hateful minus one doesnt have that problem the characters are very well written and the story with them is fantastic they grow and face their challenges that mirror the larger conflict of godzillas rampage the story tackles grief ptsd survivors guilt and forgiveness in a moving tale that can bring audiences to tears  do not miss what i can honestly say is the best movie of the year see godzilla on the biggest screen you can and enjoy the ride
Dec 3 2023,positive,the storytelling and the pacing of the movie kept everyone focused  and the correct godzilla to  human interest screen time ratio but most importantly godzilla is the villain once again
Dec 3 2023,positive,godzilla is great but you find yourself really caring for the lead charachters and the family and relationships you become invested with these charachters which clearly defines godzilla as the villian in this and you want to see his demise for their safety
Dec 3 2023,positive,one of the best films in 2023 hands down i really like the approach that was taken with this film and the message it delivers about national pride the horrors of war and the effects on its people if you are even contemplating seeing this film do yourself a favor and go see it
Dec 3 2023,positive,loved it maybe the best of all the godzilla movies
Dec 3 2023,positive,absolutely the best godzilla movie of all time at first it does the hardest thing to pull off in a godzilla movie and you actually care about the human characters the throwbacks to the 50s original with soundtrack and plot points are blended in seamlessly i saw it in an mxc theater and it is the loudest film i have ever heard sounded as if godzilla actually roared in my face it also has horror movie aspects mixed with heartbreaking moments   an instant classic
Dec 3 2023,positive,greatstop making me rate
Dec 3 2023,positive,fantastic movie with great acting visuals and a story that keeps you on the edge of your seat despite how much godzilla tends to be absent on the screen definitely worth the price of admission and then some
Dec 3 2023,positive,best godzilla movie human story is so good which is usually the downfall of kaiju movies 1010 go see it so we can get more of these
Dec 3 2023,positive,i loved the movie in color it was even better without color it reminded me of a kurosawa film highly recommend
Dec 3 2023,positive,bringing godzilla back to its roots loved it
Dec 3 2023,positive,great to have toho back in control a great amount of heart and mayhem a fun ride as godzilla comes off as terrifying and menacing
Dec 3 2023,positive,70 years later and toho still knows how to make a phenomenal godzilla film i imagine the way the 1954 version of godzilla left a lasting on the edge of your seat impression to audiences for the first time this film will provoke the same reaction
Dec 3 2023,positive,generally you can separate the godzilla movies into several categories the eras in which they were produced the americanjapanese films etc  i tend to divide them up into categories in which godzilla is the hero often the films where he battles other kaiju and the ones in which godzilla is a threatening presence in the latter category the original 1954 film will always be at the top  shin godzilla 2016 was an interesting entry and brought a sense of horror with the political commentary but my two favorites after the original are still godzilla returns 1984 and godzilla minus one 2023  minus ones human interest story was full of heart and truly moving with themes of shame guilt forgiveness redemption and ultimately life and this incarnation of godzilla was terrifying  definitely in my top five godzilla films
Dec 3 2023,positive,there where  well deserved applause at the end

Dec 3 2023,positive,it was amazing number one godzilla movie
Dec 3 2023,positive,so first of allthe only godzilla movies i have seen is the one from 2014king of the monstersand godzilla vs kong they were okay    this movie blew my mind on all spectrums i went to go see it with my 60 year old dad    right after the movie ended i looked to my dad and asked him how it was    with a straight facehe said oh yea by far the best godzilla of all time easily    i hope this gets movie of the yearbecause it 100 deserves it
Dec 3 2023,positive,best godzilla movie period the legendary godzilla crew needs to take a page from them on how to develop characters and add to the tense situations 
Dec 3 2023,positive,brought back memories of the original godzilla movie including the soundtrack
Dec 3 2023,positive,easily one of the best big g movies ever
Dec 3 2023,positive,one of the best godzilla movies ever
Dec 3 2023,positive,this was one of the best films ive seen all year easily a top 3 godzilla film for me along with the original from 1954 and shin godzilla
Dec 3 2023,positive,movie was incredible such great storytelling amazing characters development and such a real representation of what it would be like if godzilla was real i laughed i cried and i even got scared this was epic 100
Dec 3 2023,positive,best godzilla movie in years much better than the monster verse

Dec 3 2023,positive,a thrilling period picture refresh yourself on this franchise
Dec 3 2023,positive,its was time for godzilla back to japan love movies from japan  the cinematography and actions scenes are incredible
Dec 3 2023,positive,the best godzilla movie ever see it 
Dec 3 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is phenomenal
Dec 3 2023,positive,excellent one of the best movies of the year good stories bring people together
Dec 3 2023,positive,first off it was beautiful and shot in a retro style making it look like not just the characters but the actual film belonged in the days just before the first godzilla movie its also one of the only kaiju movies that made me care much about the human soap opera the characters are written and acted with depth and the film explores the theme of sacrifice on both a personal and a cultural level its not just a good kaiju movie its a good movie for anybody who reads subtitles
Dec 3 2023,positive,this film is so good great action sequences well developed characters that i genuinely cared about saw it in 4dx and the effects really enhanced the experience definitely gonna see this a few times
Dec 3 2023,positive,absolutely amazing i never thought i would care so much about the human story in a godzilla film but there were times it made me tear up
Dec 3 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is an amazing movie bringing back how godzilla was original portrayed in 1954 the classic godzilla music and the roar from a pervious incarnation give us fans a little nod i cant put into words how good this movie is
Dec 3 2023,positive,great origin story human story and special effects
Dec 3 2023,positive,excellent movie  this is probably the most well written godzilla film to have come out in a long time  its plot base and development of the characters are well written and  established  depressing and sad at times also  this is a human driven story with godzilla as the attraction  you care about what happens to the character and the people   godzilla is not a hero in this film  he is an angry pissed off force of nature  when godzilla shows up he doesnt mess around  for a low budget movie cost is a reported 15 million the visual and special effects are top notch  the movie is by no means perfect but this comes pretty close   disney should be embarrassed with their 200300 million plus flop films that was released recently   this is movie is an overall great movie in general  even if you are not a godzilla or kaiju fan  this will appeal to the wider general audiences
Dec 3 2023,positive,best of the best best godzilla movie made
Dec 3 2023,positive,i saw it early saturday morning but wanted to sit on my thoughts and see how i felt after some time hot dang this movie is amazing of the godzilla films that i have seen this is definitely top tier in my opinion to start off the story is truly captivating heartfelt and told so well it had a perfectly paced build with a satisfying climax and conclusion another positive is that even though it is a foreign film and it had subtitles it caused me to have to pay even closer attention to it which made me appreciate the film that much more at no point was i bored or wanting it to end but on the contrary it kept me invested and wanting more  with only a budget of 15 million this film used it effectively did it have its flaws yes at moments however they made it work and put out an amazing film i am going to rate this film a 95 out of 10
Dec 3 2023,positive,a godzilla film with heart  the first japanese godzilla film ive seen in the theater  i hope toho releases another kaiju film sooner rather than later
Dec 3 2023,positive,how godzilla was meant for the big screen
Dec 3 2023,positive,went to see godzilla with my son on opening night we both loved it  a nice balance of a human central story some monster mayhem im also 50 and hes 19 so it definitely appealed to both our different age groups
Dec 3 2023,positive,probably the best godzilla movie ever made and thats not hyperbole ive never been more emotionally invested in a godzilla movie than this one they made godzilla scary and malevolent again but also he still felt like an animal trying to survive even reading subtitles i felt for all the characters and didnt want anything to happen to anyone
Dec 3 2023,positive,horrifying and tenseful full of clever references to the original 1954 movie
Dec 3 2023,positive,outstanding job i was very impressed
Dec 3 2023,positive,i admit im a long time godzilla fan this movie has a great plot characters you care about and is just a fun romp my wife who isnt a huge godzilla fan loved the movie too its the best movie i have seen in a long time
Dec 3 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is arguably one of the best godzilla films not only does it bring godzilla back to its roots regarding the postworld war nuclear metaphor it also creates a stirring narrative about national and individual trauma this paired with incredibly stirring characters a cohesive plot and riveting musical score godzilla minus one is the godzilla film many have been waiting for
Dec 3 2023,positive,i had been waiting to this for one full year and was not disappointed this godzilla film fully explored the human angle and employed very skilled actors to take the audience in there are moments that will shock you and will make you cry the sheer devastating affect upon the people is overwhelming the director is more than just a director wearing the hats of director special effects creator and writer this guy knew exactly how to make this film and this film most certainly rival the lassie of all classics the original gidzilla king of the monsters this is not a monster movie it is a movie where people have been brought down to their knees and then pushed into the ground and how they respond to those circumstances dramatic terrifying exhilarating and oddly realistic you should see this film
Dec 3 2023,positive,it was great to see toho make a great movie even with a different take on the godzilla story
Dec 3 2023,positive,top 3 godzilla films of all time unlike the american versions the human story was engaging emotional and believable all of the action scenes featuring godzilla were amazingly done also considering the much smaller film budget compared to the us franchise i absolutely loved it and will be seeing it again in theaters please go out and see this on the big screen you wont be disappointed thank you toho
Dec 3 2023,positive,i saw this movie last night in imax and it is now my absolute favorite godzilla movie the story is very well done and i actually cared about the characters  i normally root for godzilla but in this time i was torn  it was an emotional rollercoaster  the graphics are incredible for a 15 million budget this movie is more than graphics  i feel that our criticism of graphics in movies has led hollywood to think that is all we want for entertainment  this movie is so much more than graphics  it has a storyline we can invest in characters we care about lots of action for entertainment a very good music score and the best iteration of godzilla to date  for me it checked off all the boxes  one of it not the best movie i have seen in years
Dec 3 2023,positive,hands down the best movie of the year
Dec 3 2023,positive,an entertaining retelling of godzilla complete with a trex like godzilla that munches people a la og jurassic park style
Dec 3 2023,positive,fantastic toho remake of the classic
Dec 3 2023,positive,if you are a godzilla fan this could be the best godzilla movie ever created  if you are not a fan of godzilla it still has the entertainment of a classic disaster movie where you care about the characters and how they surive
Dec 3 2023,positive,first time watching a japanese godzilla film and loved it the story was great and sad godzilla was awesome and evil would love to see a sequel with this story
Dec 3 2023,positive,not your typical monster movie more of a character development redemption war movie than a straight up action action monster flick but the special effects and fight scenes might be the best ive ever seen in any movie interesting plot but some of the acting was a little stilted otherwise this would rate 5 stars for me but it was worth the price and an entertaining movie
Dec 3 2023,positive,not a big godzilla fan to start off the films usually try to introduce the film to bland characters and a boring premise this movie is different in the way the characters are more emotional and have reason to be cared for godzilla is also menacing and actually scary at times good movie to enjoy if you want action and drama
Dec 3 2023,positive,that film was amazing it felt like remake of original film hell its better then both shin godzilla and original godzilla film
Dec 3 2023,positive,movie was amazing as a long time godzilla fan this one really blew me away i highly recommend if you have the money to watch it in 4dx because its such a blast
Dec 3 2023,positive,so much fun  i was really surprised by how good this movie is  go see it
Dec 3 2023,positive,best godzilla movie best movie of the year  this is cinema must watch
Dec 3 2023,positive,great movie   human story done right   and godzilla doing what godzilla should be doing  wrecking everything in his path   what a great back to basics movie hopefully all the other production companies take note what you can do with a 15million budget 
Dec 3 2023,positive,best godzilla movie storywise that has been made
Dec 3 2023,positive,new origin story in 1940s japan great movie come for the giant monster stay for character driven drama
Dec 3 2023,positive,has a good love story but kind off silly
Dec 3 2023,positive,a beautifully shot tragedy grounded in historical fiction at times it feels like youre watching dunkirk or oppenheimer often godzilla movies leave you feeling impatient to get past the humancentric side of the story that was not the case with minus one its heartfelt characters elevated this film from spectacle to existential it has been a long time since someone was able to fully and deftly capture the allegory for the horrors of war that is godzilla
Dec 3 2023,positive,ever since the short 30 second teaser came out in july ive been hooked on this movie and couldnt wait for it to come out now after already seeing it twice all i can say is that this movie is a masterpiece godzilla in this movie was genuinely terrifying and really brought back the vibes of the 1954 original the human characters were perfectly written and takashi yamazaki really makes you care about them and whenever godzilla is on screen you fear for the humans because you dont know if and when godzilla could kill them yamazakis godzilla minus one is easily in contention for movie of the year and is an instant classic
Dec 3 2023,positive,this is a powerful and deeply moving war drama that happens to have godzilla in it the characterization and storytelling are handled masterfully by director takashi yamazaki and his complete vision comes across beautifully the concept feels wholly unique within the existing godzilla franchise as well as within the modern cinematic landscape this movie showcases some of the franchises most endearing characters incredible visual effects and potent commentary on the human condition all of this on a budget of 15000000 unbelievable
Dec 3 2023,positive,great acting even if i had to read subtitles you could read the emotions on their face and actions  special effects were good and wouldnt be surprised in the least if it used both practical and cgi effects well together
Dec 3 2023,positive,exceptional character development and great godzilla destruction
Dec 3 2023,positive,my vote for one of the best godzilla movie ive seen hollywood please take notes this small budget film 15m easily beat all of yours
Dec 3 2023,positive,i loved it i grew up watching godzilla movies good story great special effects
Dec 3 2023,positive,i despise subtitles but i will make an exception for godzilla minus one the movies was so good that i also suspended my love for the campiness of the older movies i can not wait to see the movie again and i think it should win some awards i hope this movie nails the billion dollar mark
Dec 3 2023,positive,it was a fun movie in classic godzilla form  first g movie where the monster didnt seem to have a softer side at all  this was just a relentless destroyer  great depth and emotional twists unusual for g movies  not sure that it would be a movie that the uninitiated would find compelling  movie title strange even when you look up the explanation must just be a japanese things
Dec 3 2023,positive,i could see the obvious progress of quality from shingodzilla and other legendarys godzilla series its no doubt thanks to all new creators mindset to try to outperform the previous works based on and standing at the established brand godzilla all the successors can benchmark the prior ones and analyze their successful points and failures yamazaki learned a lot from annos work and made some improvements and corrections particularly on the point that it couldnt catch on overseas one of them is the music he succeeded in taking on naoki sato who is the graduate of tokyo university of the music paying respect to the alumni and predecessor ifukube and understanding his music deeply in this film vision and music are fantastically synchronized and of course the main character is godzilla but yamazaki has done well in letting him act simply as a fearful object therefore we can empathize fully with characters competing with godzilla yamazaki who has suffered a streak of bummers in making films looks to be recovering his confidence and is expected to deliver another sequel of godzilla film in which we can see a real duel with monsters like ghidra or mothra
Dec 3 2023,positive,it was just a wellmade movie its not just a good godzilla movie and a good monster movie but it had a great story with great characters you get attached to i highly recommend i can see anyone enjoying this
Dec 3 2023,positive,amazing an emotional rumination on war and trauma see if you like godzilla or even if you do not
Dec 3 2023,positive,i liked that it wasnt just a monster movie  it has a good story line  didnt really like having to read subtitles
Dec 3 2023,positive,an incredible story reminding us of the origin of this iconic character i wished there was slightly more on screen time for godzilla but it would have taken away from the human elements to this amazing story this is a must watch for any film lover
Dec 3 2023,positive,a breath of fresh air amidst all the cookie cutter comic hero politically motivated and regurgitated remakes of stories once loved there is the obvious elephant in the room  in concerns to how the war came to an end but was done in a way to not cheaply push ideals onto new and younger godzilla fans by simply displaying the disconnect of the value of life from world leaders to the everyday lower class person struggling to get by having spent some time in japan personally and was able to admire how the japanese people hold values such as honor and respect above all it was great seeing how someone may have survivors guilt when failing to carry out a kamikaze attack and how the peoples perspective could change and evolve to value their lives and neighbors lives above the honor of duty this perspective ultimately changing in the end with them willing to sacrifice themself when forced to come together to face a devastating threat such as godzilla the movie was perfectly shot and edited to pay homage to the original films and just knocked it out of the park in every aspect from the model  and even the movement of the monster as he destroyed the city chefs kiss the effects and animation was fantastic blurring the lines between practical and computer generated imagery i saw the film in the new and expensive theaters in 4dx where the seats violently jerked and rocked while air and water misted over us with flashing lights on the flanks to simulate explosions and gunfire so lets just say i got ultimate godzilla experience if youre looking to take the kids to see a movie of which you can actually enjoy with them look no further this movie is must see in my book and if im being honest would trade more of hollywood for what japan has to offer go see it
Dec 3 2023,positive,feels like sunday afternoon godzilla when i was a kid in the 80s the characters are unforgettable and when godzilla appears hes shockingly destructive the best godzilla film in years  go see it with the biggest group of people you can  a must see
Dec 3 2023,positive,compassionate non monster storyline plays well off the monster moments a more serious tone godzilla is a step up visually from previous versions destruction on a macro level and from an individual point of view is refreshing music kicked butt must see on imax if you can the sound plays a big part in this movie will see again
Dec 3 2023,positive,the film only ran for 3 days in germany i love this film and i want to see more
Dec 3 2023,positive,great writing wonderful movie
Dec 3 2023,positive,amazing i was actually afraid of this godzillanot hokey good plot a lot of substance great visuals  best ever godzilla
Dec 3 2023,positive,it looks like perfect movie i like it 
Dec 3 2023,positive,we all agreed this is a great way to reboot the original very true to the story and yet a deeper human element to the plight of the japanese people and their families post wwii being ripped apart plus it has a expanded scientific evaluation of the new terrible threat of gojira and since it is the first movie he is down scaled in size    the attention to detail is staggering in this film and the soundtrack is incredible and gives a huge nod to the score of the classic it represents the acting is good very good in some areas and despite a few drags in the script it is a remarkable movie    also i will say this the cgi isnt top of the notch but it looks a heck of a lot more realistic than the new aquaman that is coming out that looks borderline cartoon
Dec 3 2023,positive,although i am not a fan of subtitles this movie held my interest  it had a good storyline in addition to the monster
Dec 3 2023,positive,godzilla fan or not go see this movie a serious ww2 drama with deep characters and story linesand of course godzilla this is the movie we always wanted the 
Dec 3 2023,positive,best movie of 2023 cant go wrong with godzilla
Dec 3 2023,positive,an absolute masterpiece scorsese nolan step aside this is the best film of the year
Dec 3 2023,positive,easily the best godzilla movie ever a great balance between the human screentime and godzillas screen time helped just like in tohos previous installment shin godzilla they made the king of the monsters something terrifying there was one scene that looked like a high blood pressure drug commercial but its unlikely anyone would care 1010 must watch maybe even twice
Dec 3 2023,positive,if youre looking for the best godzilla film look no further  perhaps in time after repeated viewings or as the film stands the test of time my opinion on its position in the franchise may change but for now this is it  the best
Dec 3 2023,positive,this is how you do a godzilla movie the characters and story were so well done godzilla minus one is a masterpiece
Dec 3 2023,positive,this movie is really interesting  youll want to see it again and again  you want to talk to someone  this is a movie right
Dec 3 2023,positive,great movie that not only looked good but also delivered a performance like no other from its actors
Dec 3 2023,positive,other than the very last moment there is nothing i would change about this movie and even that is a nit pick forget the godzilla in the title this is easily one of the most universal affecting and impactful human dramas in many years this is a movie that makes you cheer cry and tremble every last one of the main characters is compelling and relatable hollywood has lost its way so i am glad that japan can come around and show us yanks how to make fantastic touching cinema again even on a relatively shoestring budget you dont see that anywhere on screen the effects are wonderful and the acting is even better the godzilla scenes are great but the story scenes with the characters were so good i was almost a bit relieved when there wasnt an action scene congratulations toho studios and japan for this unexpected gem of a film i will happily watch multiple times in cinema watch it in the biggest theater with the best sound you can the music is absolutely perfect
Dec 3 2023,positive,a true masterpiece of movie making just sensational the score the acting the visual effects just incredible after horrible movies like the marfails and the flush its great to finally get a movie that leaves me happy when i leave the theatre i would go as far as saying perfect
Dec 3 2023,positive,more than just a godzilla movie 
Dec 3 2023,positive,normally you would say remember this is a godzilla movie so excuse such and such this is not the case here if you manage to pull yourself out of the incredible acting you would say i cant believe this quality is in a godzilla movie
Dec 3 2023,positive,absolutely beautiful and inspiringuplifting i really needed a movie like this i can only hope itll inspire others as well
Dec 3 2023,positive,the godzilla minus one is the best movie from all godzilla series from any type of  monsters movies   yamazakis work as director and also as screenwriter did marvelous work with drama tension and sadness and destruction   differently watch this movie on cinema highly recommended
Dec 3 2023,positive,excellent film finally a kaijuhorror film where you can actually sympathize with the characters and care whether they die or not    godzilla was perfectly done its refreshing to see a godzilla film where itheshe acts as a main antagonist and is simply a ravenous destructive beast it was truly terrifying
Dec 3 2023,positive,a monster movie that brought tears to my eyes the human toll is so great it nothing short of horrifying
Dec 3 2023,positive,wow this was a breath of fresh air im so happy seeing japanese cinema putting out a great godzilla movie like this  cinema has been stale lately so it was nice going to the cinemas to watch something good this story touched my heart 3 go japanese cinema

Dec 3 2023,positive,even with it just carrying subtitles throughout the movie it was just so good and godzilla was no disappointment great movie
Dec 3 2023,positive,hands down one of if not the best godzilla movies i have ever seen the movie makes sure to get right into the monster action while also having a compelling story with wonderful and very likeable characters    though i do recommend that you get some tissues when you see this movie because its an emotional rollercoaster in all the right ways
Dec 3 2023,positive,1010 an absolute triumph of storytelling and action seamlessly weaved together monster movies are not allowed to be this good but godzilla1 is truly an exception to the rule i even forgot that the movie was in another language dont miss this

Dec 3 2023,positive,an absolute phenomenal movie the human characters were emotional and actually interesting you care for them this film shows the  heartbreak and destruction caused by godzilla japan nails it again as america tries its bestbut doesnt come closeto proper godzilla films such as this
Dec 3 2023,positive,incredible best monster movie ever ive seen a lot and this one will surprise you as it has a great story with humans thatll show emotion laughter and love the actionwow just wow the scenes with godzilla were crazy in a destructive way but visually impressive its hard to believe its not a hollywood blockbuster as this movie has that feel and really deserves a godzilla size pat on the back for an amazing job whats been produced with this filmwow
Dec 3 2023,positive,great movie everything i always wanted godzilla movies to be  great story line and acting and monster action great job toho
Dec 3 2023,positive,i cant believe im saying this but this film was oscar caliber entertainment acting directing screeplay sound special effects all of it was top of the line if the lead actor doesnt get a best actor nomination it will be a travesty im so glad they did subtitles and not dubbed to english or it would have diminished the whole acting and storytelling of the film absolutely one of the best films of the year if you had told me id be teary eyed and gently sobbing at a godzilla movie i would have laughed at you but there i was at the endand i was not the only one in the theater ive sat in shock at what i just witnessed at few movies including parasite and saltburn and now i can add godzilla minus one to that list the only complaint would be i dont think they can ever top it if that can be a complaint godzilla minus onei went to watch a giant monster and got an actual masterpiece of storytelling 1010
Dec 3 2023,positive,one of the best godzilla movies ever i hope its a tie in to the ones theyre doing now and the monarch series 
Dec 3 2023,positive,this is how its done good job japan movie industry see this hollywood this is how you make a movie and it only cost 15 million to make and yet its better than any of the 100 million dollar movies you guys have released this is a big plus for godzilla minus 1
Dec 3 2023,positive,best godzilla film toho killed this everything was well done worth seeing again
Dec 3 2023,positive,godzilla minus one blew all my expectations away  what an incredible film it freaking rules it isnt just an amazing godzilla film but one of the best films of the year this truly puts hollywoods versions of godzilla to shame im by no means a godzilla expert but this was easily the best godzilla movie ive ever seen i havent seen an audience this excited and visibly satisfied by a movie in quite some time this film showcases how to make the perfect godzilla picture with a compelling human ensemble and breathtaking action thats savoured from start to finish  plus it truly takes godzilla back to being a truly horrifying monster and has the coolest use of the atomic breath ive ever seen    the action is incredible and brutal and the vfx work is insanely good i also really loved the cinematography and the killer sound design plus the score is excellent and uses akira ifukubes iconic godzilla theme to great effect    but the reason this film stands out is because of its combination of great storytelling mixed with great technical achievements theres reason to care about the characters and a deeply emotional side to this film that makes the monster even more haunting this is a monster film where the human conflict is just as compelling if not more so than the tremendous action sequences i loved the exploration of the traumas of war and cultural destruction in japan following wwii and the ways the characters connected to these themes made for such a strong emotional core this film has the perfect blend of massive monster mayhem and compelling human drama that really worked its so good that you could remove godzilla from the film and still have a great film this is a moving thoughtful japanese character drama set in postwar japan that also happens to have a giant horrific monster in it people are gonna talk about godzilla minus ones amazing production and filmmaking but what surprised me the most was the script every character has an arc and serves a purpose and there are no wasted beats there are so many great dilemmas and dramatic questions also a perfect example of using the monster as a greater metaphor the result is a thrilling epic that feels grounded and meaningful and so so good     godzilla minus one is a nighmasterpiece not only is godzilla terrifying again but the film itself is a powerful drama with some daunting imagery plenty of emotional moments sound design to rock the theatre and a moving character study on postwar guilt and ptsd its a genuinely exciting riveting emotional disaster flick delivering drama you care about and thunderous action spectacle see minus one on the loudest biggest screen you can possibly find and enjoy the ride  its incredible    i gotta add its like act one is jurassic park act two is jaws and act three is dunkirk just such an awesome movie
Dec 3 2023,positive,if your a monster universe lover its 6 stars if you like godzilla its a five star  if you like a good movie its min 4  star   5 out of 5 roars
Dec 3 2023,positive,this was such a great movie the last few years of the hollywood godzilla movies often focused on the human stories that really werent so interesting and made you want godzilla on screen all the time this movies human story along with a great godzilla hit the right balance and was surprisingly moving
Dec 3 2023,positive,godzilla minus one in 4dx was so so amazing the best movie of the year director takahshi yamazaki really know how to make this movie perfect  gojira is always the strongest kaiju
Dec 3 2023,positive,one of the best godzilla movies ever i didnt mind reading the subtitles either
Dec 3 2023,positive,as a longtime fan of godzilla movies from the earlier films to the modern era i have been part of a fanbase that has endured both gems and dumpster fires but i can honestly say this is the best of the modern series started from the 2010s  the ip has the hollywoodproduced godzilla film of 2014 to thank for the renewed interest that convinced both japanese and american studios to release a series of new movies with now three of them playing with the reboot concept as far as japanese produced live action theatrical movies this is the second one after shin godzilla in 2016     while shin godzilla was an interesting and engaging film set in presentday japan using the 2011 tsunami and nuclear disaster as the backdrop one could definitely feel the evangelioninspired direction from hideki anno it even included the same music from the evangelion composer shiro sagisu it had an almost exhausting plot that is dialogheavy that meshes the human suffering trials and failures along with the politics of managing a situation if such an event were to happen in reality although flawed it is a decent godzilla film with plenty of overthetop monster action coupled with a solution that might be possible to pull off in the real world    godzilla minus zero uses wwii and the start of postwar japan as the setting just as the japanese faced defeat at the hands of the us we follow the story of a kamikaze pilot who must deal with his situation when he chooses to neglect his duty not willing to die for something he sees as pointless as he chose not to die he feels that his war is not over and this message is what drives his story     his path crosses the famous monster at a relatively early stage of its development and is described as a dinosaurlike monster which was interesting to see the events that follow our small group of characters is a series of highly relatable human struggles as the japanese citizens try to recover from the war but are faced with another threat in godzilla the familiar origin story from previous films of islandbased nuclear testing causing mutations in godzilla is the main cause for its massive size and abilities including the heatatomic breath and regenerative properties    the movie is smart enough to give a very plausible method of defeating the monster even though we as an audience know it will work in the end the way it is presented seems possible with the wwii technology of the time there is some doubt on if it will actually work against the monste even up until the end of the film we even get cameos of some famous japanese warships so fans of naval history kancolle or azur lane might get a kick out of that like i did    the cgi effects were mostly believable since were past the point of a man in a rubber suit the play the part of godzilla the design and some of the effects of this version of godzilla reminded me of the 2014 movie along with some shin godzilla elements this is probably the best godzilla has looked in any of the modern movies godzilla takes up just enough screen time so that youre not bored out of your mind seeing the monster destroy countless buildings which doesnt actually happen as much as youd think also we get to see the creature clearly enough so its not completely shrouded in mystery  regarding godzillas attacks the famous atomic breath is seen as highly devastating equal to that of an atomic bomb explosion that is actually used sparingly and the effects that are presented when godzilla uses it were impressive     overall as someone who has seen most of the modern liveaction godzilla movies this one was the most enjoyable with a believable plot and highly relatable characters it takes the human element of people struggling to survive in a postwar environment coupled with the unknown threat of a seemingly invincible monster it is brilliantly directed with actors that truly convey the weight of their situation that never crosses the line of something superhuman to overcome the threat in godzilla using subtle visual effects excellent cinematography a smart script along with some of the classic soundtrack of the old godzilla movies it does feel like this movie could have been made in the same period as those old movies theres no attempt to go overboard and give the audience sensory overload to convince them what they are watching is a good film like with modern superhero movies    as a godzilla movie it is probably the best and out of all the movies this year in 2023 this is one of the best if not the best
Dec 3 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is a masterpiece not just an incredible godzilla movie but an incredible science fiction film the plot is dramatic you connect to the characters and the action the action is something else the destruction caused by godzilla is done in such a way that feels realistic but doesnt scale back on godzillas power godzilla comes across as force of nature overall no complaints if im not nitpicking
Dec 3 2023,positive,arguably if not the best godzilla movie hands down this will take you on such an emotional journey and the give you a sinister feeling of when and what godzilla will do next to the people of japan in its most vulnerable state after ww2 is over go support this movie toho knocked it out the park with this one
Dec 3 2023,positive,an amazing film from start to finish keeps you engaged with all the main cast and godzilla is terrifying highly recommend to those not familiar with godzilla as a fresh beginning will be watching again
Dec 3 2023,positive,this is an absolutely incredible movie i love every aspect of what was done with this godzillas new look and horrifying temperament made for one terrifying big screen experience the music was very well done  but there were also plenty of moments that had very heavy atmosphere where there was no background music or ambient sound to distract you from what was on screen in the aftermath of all of godzillas destruction the lingering silence was very eerie the way they did his voice and overall temperament in this case aggression towards mankind was incredible the way godzilla developed throughout the movie as a result of atomic radiation was amazing to see  some of the aerial scenes from an airplane perspective had me just about jumping out of my seat as godzilla was snapping his jaws at the pilot i watched this twice in the d box at megaplex and both times felt like this was almost like a ride and a movie because the seats would move in conjunction with the waves affecting the boats on screen because this is a foreign film i do not know any of the actors but the entire cabsolutely nailed it and did a fantastic job in some godzilla movies the human element leaves much to be desired that is certainly not the case in this masterpiece of a movie this is probably the best godzilla movie ive ever seen and i have seen them all  if youre looking for a fun thrilling movie i highly recommend you go see this while its in the movie theater to enjoy it and all of its majesty on the big screen
Dec 3 2023,positive,great movie with great story and monster action
Dec 3 2023,positive,shin godzilla is good this one is even better

Dec 3 2023,positive,incredible movie its brutal horrifying gripping and heart wrenching
Dec 3 2023,positive,loved it classic godzilla plus a genuinely heart warming story
Dec 3 2023,positive,top 3 movie this year
Dec 3 2023,positive,amazing movie a must see for any godzilla fan
Dec 3 2023,positive,hes baaaaaaack    story action godzilla if i had three thumbs they would all be up go see it
Dec 3 2023,positive,fantastic side movie to the original godzilla usa has mostly lost the art of the cinema other than a few directors happy to see japan can show us what cinema should look like take lessons america
Dec 3 2023,positive,i was thrilled to see an actionpacked movie with a genuine soul the visual effects looked consistently good    one of the best films ive seen all year
Dec 3 2023,positive,i never thought i would gove a movie a 100 but this is just perfection best movie of the year by far excellent really excellent writing godzillas design is awesome also
Dec 3 2023,positive,easily one of the best if not the best godzilla movie ive ever seen not only are of the scenes with the big g amazing but the humans characters are just phenomenal this is one of the only monster movies ive seen where every time the monster is on screen im genuinely terrified for whats going to happen to our main cast
Dec 3 2023,positive,amazing movie to watch good storyline a throwback to what movies were greatly enjoyed the characters and overall movie 
Dec 3 2023,positive,2023 movie of the year   beautiful characters and terrifying monster
Dec 3 2023,positive,probably my new favorite godzilla movie to date had a blast watching it simply incredible
Dec 3 2023,positive,great story and visuals is entertaining
Dec 3 2023,positive,a must see movie if you are godzilla fan the action was epic
Dec 3 2023,positive,not your typical repeat of every hollywood script well written incredibly wellacted and totally engaging yes you have to read subtitles but even my 14 yo son said it was the best move he has seen this year
Dec 3 2023,positive,hell freakn yes go see it go see it go see it
Dec 3 2023,positive,i was surprised by how absorbed i got into this film and was impressed with literally every actor on the screen what a rare treat i also think hollywood should take a lesson from this movie the special effects are tasteful and do not try to become the story they compliment the story well done
Dec 3 2023,positive,oh man this was the highlight of my year such a great story and the action and cg were great no part of the runtime is waisted and i hope this gets a sequel
Dec 3 2023,positive,the best monster movies always have compelling characters and peoplelevel conflict at their heart and this one is really beautifully thoughtout written and acted the story of a failed kamikaze pilot isnt one ive seen really in any media and he makes for a fascinating center of a movie about how to go on living after calamity the decision to have all the big action setpieces in sunny broad daylight is a bold one and a nice foil to the 2014 godzilla that mostly works but it does mean all the cgilooks like cgi
Dec 3 2023,positive,10 out of 10 would recommend
Dec 3 2023,positive,wow a godzilla with an easy to follow human story and lots of godzilla action through out the whole story cant wait for another 10 years for another actually good godzilla movie
Dec 3 2023,positive,this movie is pretty much perfect  the story here is unique and compelling with postworld war ii japan being the perfect setting for this thoughtful and intense kaiju film  the movie also does a great job of balancing a human storyline against the ferocity of godzilla and never shies away from giving the big lizard plenty of screentime  the only aspect of this movie that may be considered a negative by some is that it is a pure japanese language film with only english subtitles given the subject matter here however i felt that this was a brilliant choice that really added to the experience of the film  this is hands down the best godzilla movie that i have ever watched and just a really great film overall  id highly recommend it
Dec 3 2023,positive,godzilla at his badassiest
Dec 3 2023,positive,i just got out the movie theater and this movie is epic godzilla was terrifying every time he showed up and for once i didnt mind the human stories well tohos human stories are always decent to good  cant wait to get this on dvd or streaming because there were a ton of scenes i quickly wanted to rewind haha  ive only seen 2 movies this year and both were 55  awesome job toho
Dec 3 2023,positive,wow what a great movie  no message or agenda   humans showing emotions   this looks better at 15 million dollar budget that captain marvel at 300 million  probably the most fun i have had at the movies all year
Dec 3 2023,positive,this is the best movie ive seen in years my son and i saw it thursday tomorrow im taking my wife and daughter to see it also even though they arent into the monster verse like us they will enjoy the movie my new favorite godzilla

Dec 3 2023,positive,one of the best godzilla movies ever
Dec 3 2023,positive,this is an absolute modern day masterpiece its like all of what the original thrills the audiences of the first godzilla films must have felt but somehow masterfully transfigured into the modern world im not the hugest godzilla fan or know much about it but i felt like i was there in the first time people saw the monster tearing apart the world
Dec 3 2023,positive,if this movie doesnt win best picture they should retire the academy beautifully done poignant and emotional at times great characters the story kept you emotionally committed and godzilla was scary as hell menacing hollywood cant do this toho is the true masters of the franchise and its set for sequels
Dec 3 2023,positive,arguably one of the best films of 2023 and possibly the best of the entire godzilla franchise
Dec 3 2023,positive,absolutely fantastic movie first godzilla movie in a long time that i actually was rooting for the humans the human parts were compelling and emotional the monster parts for terrifying    i caution that those with ptsd be prepared especially if you have survivor s guilt like myself    fully love this movie in spite of that
Dec 3 2023,positive,amazing like watching the og movies when i was a kid even my dad was freaking out
Dec 3 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is a dream come true  having heard many great things about this film i just couldnt wait to see it and having done so now it has far exceeded my expectations it is a love letter to the original 1954 japanese film gojira which in itself is a classic 70 years later toho has now made that classic into a 2023 masterpiece this is an amazing postwar story one of tragedy love and loss the main characters are believable and you feel their anguish and pain its a very smart clever film that will grab you and not let you go the audio and soundtrack is perfect the sets and special effects are nothing short of astonishing  the best weve seen this is a tremendous movie and the best part is that its a godzilla film for the ages not only is it the best godzilla film we are likely to ever see but its also one of the best monster films ever made
Dec 3 2023,positive,the movie was definitely one of the best movies of 2023 japan knows what they are doing the movie was so good telling the story of the side effects of war and the story of japans side of world war ii tying it in with the sci fi of godzilla was just a perfect match up for a great film the story was filled with emotion and incredible moments and storytelling which why i can say this was definitely one of the best movies of the  year
Dec 3 2023,positive,the godzilla movie everyone has wanted
Dec 3 2023,positive,this is hands down the best godzilla movie yet this period piece finally gives us a human story with emotions in which we dread to see godzilla everytime he arrives on scene we are filled with excitement at his power but dread at what he may do we want the characters we follow to survive in a way i havent felt before in other kaiju films
Dec 3 2023,positive,the movie was a master piece just 15 million dollars can make this it was a really emotional and thrilling movie you dont even need to be a godzilla fan to like this movie you will love it and thats a ganranted
Dec 3 2023,positive,phenomenal from beginning to end captivating story and excellent execution
Dec 3 2023,positive,the only godzilla story that invokes the same feeling as the original a near perfect modern recreation with its own small twists likable characters stellar action moments and meaningful messages stayed faithful to the franchise the entire time the only downside for myself was the theater we watched at showed this on one of their worst projectors definitely wish i could have seen this imax if i knew it was this good
Dec 3 2023,positive,this movie was nothing less than incredible a absolute must watch regardless of if you are a godzilla fan or someone getting to experience a godzilla movie for the first time not only was godzilla an absolute beast but the story of the movie with the humans was absolutely perfect 1010 would recommend
Dec 3 2023,positive,very dark and true to the original godzilla i like how ruthless he is
Dec 3 2023,positive,amazing movie that takes godzilla to the next level and sets the bar for future movies
Dec 3 2023,positive,makes you remember how terrifying godzilla can be visually stunning and great compelling characters a must watch in imax
Dec 3 2023,positive,one of the best movies if not the best movie of 2023 the raw nature force of godzilla is truly terrifying on the big screen the story telling is top notch and the roller coaster of emotions felt throughout leaves you on the edge of your seat as the great cast makes you feel for them especially the main character
Dec 3 2023,positive,aside from some translation issues regarding aircraft it was a great film i enjoyed the human drama along with the monster parts it was well done and one of the best godzilla movies i have seen in a while considering i liked shin godzilla that says a lot
Dec 3 2023,positive,absolute perfection
Dec 3 2023,neutral,godzilla minus one is one of the best godzilla movies ever made i should know ive been watching godzilla movies since i was five years old its essentially a reimagined version of the first godzilla film released in 1954     this is a japanese movie with english subtitles that kicks things off at the end of world war ii in wartorn tokyo the plot is definitely man vs monster this is not a multimonster extravaganza and godzilla is not a good guy this time around facing impossible odds our protagonists japanese navy veterans and civilians employ science and ingenuity to take on a seemingly invincible radioactive creature from the deep     ill admit the film drags at times between battles and attacks but a good plot means you cant have nonstop action or the audience would be exhausted what will really blow your mind is that this film was made on a shoestring budget of only 15 million i guess when you have a good story you dont need 200 million in cgi and special effects directors and producers all over hollywood need to take a good look in the mirror and question how much money it actually takes to deliver a movie with a good story    godzilla minus one should definitely be in the running for best foreign film at the oscars i loved it and i think you will too i give this film 3 12 stars out of 5
Dec 3 2023,positive,the story was amazing and so were the portrayers good screen time for the big g loved it
Dec 3 2023,positive,there arent any describable words that i can possibly use
Dec 3 2023,positive,absolutely awesome  edge of your seat movie deep story line every emotional
Dec 3 2023,positive,i could see some who just wanted mindless action might not like the pacing i thought minus one did what its predecessors have all failed to do it offered up a compelling story for its human characters i was invested in their stories i cared if they lived or died godzilla looked great and by far the best atomic breath of any godzilla movie dont let the subtitles scare you off you want the theater experience for this one
Dec 3 2023,positive,ive always been a godzilla fan but i can honestly say this is the first godzilla movie that actually tells a really good story
Dec 3 2023,positive,hands down movie of the year this movie had everything i was expecting a cheezy monster movie but it was a spectacular vision of the plight of two young people devoted to each other in the midst of a disaster movie
Dec 3 2023,positive,a masterpiece of emotional storytelling    wonderful characters action and music this is what cinema should be 
Dec 3 2023,positive,masterclass of a film a brilliant reimagining of a beloved classic and one of the rare instances of a godzilla film having great human protagonists the stakes were high the visuals were outstanding godzilla was menacing and the acting was top notch an absolute love letter to the franchise and its fans to think this film was created on a budget of 15 million not a dime wasted
Dec 3 2023,positive,this film is an emotionally impactful human drama set against the backdrop of a devastated postww2 japan and the emergence of an existential threat in the form of godzilla     godzilla minus one is focused on a young soldier wracked with guilt over his actions during the war his struggle to accept life and allow himself to love again is very moving  godzilla is the threat to those he cares about but also the opportunity to resolve his crisis assuage his feelings of guilt and redeem himself    the special effects are impressive despite an almost unbelievably small budget there is a reality to the devastation that was never achieved post the original film add to it that one cares about the characters    the score is very affecting and unusual for a godzilla film there were wonderful callbacks to ifukubes score to the original earlier films too    artfully directed well written earnestedly acted by a convincing ensemble castthis is surprisingly one of the best movies of the year
Dec 3 2023,positive,the film that leaves you wanting more the build up of the human story is the driving force behind the movie and godzilla is a force to be reckoned with you almost dont want it to show up but when it does its horrifying and intense great film the best this year
Dec 3 2023,positive,the story characters and even the introduction of godzilla were perfect no hopefully american media can learn from this masterpiece
Dec 3 2023,positive,a very wellcrafted and powerful film that rivals the original gojira in excellence an epic war drama with godzilla serving to further drive an alreadycompelling story with truly fleshedout characters the film never loses pace whether or not godzilla is on screen and the film is shot so as to keep the viewer constantly mesmerized by what is happening onscreen you can tell that the cast and crew set out to craft a very powerful film that has much to say on the themes of life perseverance and the quest for identity in a changing world this is truly a film that is sure to be enjoyed by both casual moviegoers and fans of the franchise

Dec 3 2023,positive,breathtaking  wonderful story with great effects and action  i would have liked to see a little more destruction from godzilla but thats something i find with every godzilla movie  the time that is used to show the destruction caused by godzilla is topnotch immaculately choreographed with some awesome in the classical sense camera angles sounds and visual effects that were very engrossing  more importantly though the characters and their stories were the most engrossing of any godzilla or other monster movie film id seen and i really grew to like all of them   55 stars

Dec 3 2023,positive,the movie was amazing the story was amazing i wish it had more godzilla
Dec 3 2023,positive,ok not exactly at 5 stars but damn close the subtitles at first annoyed me but then it was actually better than dubbing in the words the only reason its not 5 stars is not enough godzilla and i like godzilla more as a good godzilla as opposed to a bad one  fighting another kaju is the best but im nitpicking  its was flipping geeat

Dec 3 2023,positive,a completely different take on godzilla movies that has substance at its core anchored by human intracacies and story telling that connect you to the movie through heartwrenching story that is complemented artfully with godzilla as a backdrop adding action thrills and symbolic meaning its a substantive movie that is worth the watch
Dec 3 2023,positive,great story with tension and a great pay off  it is unbelievable how good godzilla looked on a 15m budget  godzillas atomic breath is truly atomic
Dec 3 2023,positive,experienced this in 4dx  while my theater didnt take advantage of all the scents it couldve the well timed motion action was beyond awesome  fyi dont bother woth snacks the movie itself was well done realistic setting for bringing ww2 era vibe  the subtitles were barely noticeable  and the acting was done so well i forgot i was reading it  its simplified script was beyond successful in using actors expressively without having much dialogue or backstory to sustain it  it was not as campy as the ones in the past and i was impressed with their creation of the monster  while far fetched at times it did not appear cgi or a rubber suit i left still not understanding godzillas motivation or origination and the title had to be explained to methey were being clever and vague on the battle scorei think no matter what format you see it inits a great flick
Dec 3 2023,positive,now thats a godzilla film superb

Dec 3 2023,positive,still in shock as im writing this one of the best godzilla movies ever made and my favorite movie of the year every character is unforgettable and has their moment to shine godzilla is terrifying loud and awesome the score is dreadfully intense and the visuals are fantastic for a movie with a tenth of the budget that many big american films are made with i didnt think toho would do it again so soon after shin godzilla but godzilla minus one is an instant masterpiece

Dec 3 2023,positive,quite possibly perfect a perfect movie not just a perfect godzilla movie
Dec 3 2023,positive,the plot in this movie was absolutely breath taking at first i didnt think i would like it due to the subtitles but the amount of work that went into this movie was unreal i was amazed that it topped godzilla vs king ghidora even though there was no monster for godzilla to go up against and it was just him vs the humans really loved the thought that went into the plot i actually connected with the characters which is not the usual for action movies the acting was also fantastic that level of storytelling and emotion in an action movie is something that has been lacking loved it must watch again and paired it with the 4dx for the extra experience
Dec 3 2023,positive,it was a fantastic movie with great music a most menacing godzilla with good acting and great callbacks to older godzilla movies it was the most emotional of all g movies in my opinion which is a good thing

Dec 3 2023,positive,amazing experience in imax  the way the movie is shot is beautiful and immersive  loved the human story and really shows a part of post ww2 japan and the scars of war  loved that g man was basically a personification of the nuclear devastation
Dec 3 2023,positive,together with shin godzilla toho brings back the original premise of 1954 godzilla to a global audience a human centric story where the citizens work together to have a fighting chance against godzilla a walking unstoppable monster that brings the nation to brick of annihilation even if the government fails them     whats shocking is the amount of risk toho taking with the setting a post world war 2 japan with the protagonist being a kami kaze pilot if you arent familiar these are the suicide jets that flies straight to high value targets without any means of escape    i am pleased to say the movie does not glorify the ww2 japan its a movie about survival wanting to live wanting to move beyond the haunting past that has drown the nation    the movie says a lot about how japanese felt during postwar japan the anger nihilism sorrow makes it difficult for some to even accept the joy of life some eventually did some are still living in the past    godzilla being the villain of the movie brings in yet another complete destruction that valuable rebuilt progress sounds familiar the constant earthquakes in japan the lost decades of japan after the economic crisis for a nation that tries so hard it seems the odds are always stacked against them the glimmer of hope just never stays    the plot spends a lot of time and effort building up its characters which are exceptionally well crafted and the relationship between them are organic and easy to like  this gives every scene that we used to cheer for godzilla appearingusing heat ray an entirely different atmosphere     we see the level of destruction closely on the ground and the amount of damage being done to the precious rebuild effort is heartbreaking for the audience and of course how the loss of lives and rebuild effort destroyed extinguished the hope and optimism along as well    it also does something rarely seen in western cinema nowadays where plots are mostly in the extremes look at how mighty our nation is vs look at how terrible and shameful our past is the former is vanishing even  while not saying these movies dont have their importance but very rarely do we get any movies that brings the nation together through collective pain and bring in positivity despite all odds    while some would call this an antiwar movie this is more about existentialism which is a common theme in japanese works and ironically this philosophy originated from francegermany post world war 1 and frankly has vanished from most western literarycinema     overall for the average audience this is a great movie with great sound tracksound effect decent visual for godzilla fans this brings back the horror and og godzilla feel   for movie lovers this is a great work about humanity and japans spirit a reminisce of the peak japanese movie decades from the 70s    japan is on its path of economic recovery with great results in sportsarts etc in the past few years  this movie and shin godzilla are love letters to the japanese people for their resilient and willing to take responsibility for a better future despite all the flaws from the system or the past
Dec 3 2023,positive,for a movie thats at a disadvantage and this is the best movie of 2023 by far
Dec 3 2023,positive,best godzilla movie in my lifetimehas everything you love in a movie from plot to characters it did not disappoint

Dec 3 2023,positive,brilliant work of drama and companion piece to the 1954 landmark original
Dec 3 2023,positive,it just wasnt a monster movie it was a complete movie i rate it 2 after the 1954 movie the best of 2023 hollywood just got its butt kicked good toho rules
Dec 3 2023,positive,fantastic adaptation to the classic godzilla story this is one of the top 3 godzilla movies of all time i can not recommend it enough
Dec 3 2023,positive,watched the movie earlier today and omg really one of the best godzilla movies ive ever seen and top 5 films of mine ever made this is great really and you should really check this out very heartwarming human story and a super badass godzilla

Dec 3 2023,positive,an absolute masterpiece i grew up watching godzilla with my dad and have been a huge fan since i can remember and this movie is hands down the greatest godzilla movie ever the story the music the action seeing him back to his roots of being the villain and damn does he look terrifying so well done could not have been any better
Dec 3 2023,positive, 100 recommended 
Dec 3 2023,positive,the movie looks absolutely amazing far better than anything hollywood has produced

Dec 3 2023,positive,more than just a monster movie an incredibly well made and beautiful story that you are completely immersed in one of the best movies ive ever seen
Dec 3 2023,positive,top 5 godzilla movies of all time time well spent
Dec 3 2023,positive,very good movie great score impressive visuals and soild storytelling i think of it as what the original 1954 team envisioned but couldnt do due to limitations of technology and government restrictions
Dec 3 2023,positive,the most realistic godzilla movie ever
Dec 3 2023,positive,loved it best movie of the year
Dec 3 2023,positive,this movie is amazing
Dec 3 2023,positive,im a 48 year old life long godzilla fan  i believe that minus one is the best modern godzilla film since 2001s  gmk  besides a few non distracting nods to the 1954 film minus one is very different from the rest   it has a very strong and compelling human story  it probably has the best writing of any godzilla film in that regards  it may be set in a post war japan but it is far from being a remake of the 1954 film
Dec 3 2023,positive,fantastic movie for 15 million  the effects were good if not perfect but you hardly care because the movie is engaging lots of emotion and as a family man there were some genuinely touching moments the set up was good character growth all around and the finale was wellearned as a result you should see this movie if you dont mind subtitles oscar worthy
Dec 3 2023,positive,it was absolutely amazing it had great action scenes and an actual engaging human element i would recommend this to everyone it was tense fun and also at times very touching
Dec 3 2023,positive,the movie was absolutely great no movie has ever brought me to tears like this one i loved every single moment if you have a chance watch this movie not just once  but twice this movie is unforgettable and a masterpiece
Dec 3 2023,positive,this is hands down the best movie ive seen this year its oscarworthy and thats not hyperbole the script is perfect the themes explored are deep and heartfelt  the postwar trauma of an entire nation survivor guilt shame ptsd what makes a family love redemption forgiving others forgiving oneself the value of life and choosing to live in the face of terrible odds youd never think a movie about a giant monster stomping on stuff would make you feel for and root for the human characters but godzilla minus one does just that  i cant say this enough  go watch it if you were ever a godzilla fan go watch it even if you were never a godzilla fan go watch it this movie is easily one of the best movies of 2023  and all for a very modest 15 milliondollar budget compared to the hundreds of millions hollywood pours into its often disappointing blockbusters
Dec 3 2023,positive,this was the best kaiju film ever period end of story the blending of history and the start of godzillas evolutionmythology was amazing the acting wasnt overwhelming and it served as a guide through the destruction of godzilla physically and mentally
Dec 3 2023,positive,gorilla is my one favorite monster
Dec 3 2023,positive,those looking for a popcorn creature feature with 90 minutes of no plot and walltowall destruction may find themselves disappointed with this japanese feature celebrating the 70th anniversary of the longest running franchise but those looking for the definition of cinema will be rewarded with thrilling action sequences special effects that beat out every marvel and dc comic universe entry to date an epic film score stunning cinematography and most surprising of all a heartfelt poetic story supported by a stellar and earnest emotional cast performance
Dec 3 2023,positive,it was very loud but had unexpected character plots its not just about the monster
Dec 3 2023,positive,easily the best godzilla movie ive ever seen well done to all involved in the making of this film
Dec 3 2023,positive,one of the best godzilla movies ever
Dec 3 2023,positive,finally a godzilla movie that doesnt strictly rely on special effects a cast of great actors who make you care about their characters hopefully we get a sequel because this movie deserves it
Dec 3 2023,positive,one of the best godzilla movies of all time amazing story godzilla back to his roots of being a terror absolute masterpiece highly recommend
Dec 3 2023,positive,my adult son is a huge fan of the lore he asked if i wanted to check it out and i said yes  cuz i love going to the movie theater no great expectations  and just got blown away incredible characters engaging storyline great movie making must see movie in the theater dont miss it
Dec 3 2023,positive,absolutely must see
Dec 3 2023,positive,for me its one of the best if not the best films of the year movies in hollywood recently have shifted abit away from what a good movie is about for a small budget of 15m this movie was a masterpiece godzilla was great human characters were great story was great cg was great so if you ask me about my complaints i do have two small ones that arent really complaints actually i would appreciate a little more godzilla sequences and the cg did look a bit rough on the edges in some really rare occasions that said i enjoyed the whole thing and even if the gman wasnt on screen all the time i was still invested in the human characters which is rare in a godzilla movie these days two hours went by without me noticing because i didnt get bored granted not all people will connect 100 with the movie it depends on wether you are a godzilla fan or not for example or if you have some knowledge of how japan suffered from wwii ect but i do think that every viewer will enjoy at least some parts of the movie if not all of it i really recommend seeing it even if its subtitled you wont even feel it like an issue anymore after the first 5 minutes of the movie because you will be invested great story great performance emotional at times and godzillawasawesome
Dec 3 2023,positive,the movie was so good my only dislike is the movement of godzilla being when he was walking but i was told the reason and why a must see
Dec 3 2023,positive,ok normally a godzilla movie especially made by toho is always pretty cheesy with the guy in a suit stomping tokyo   yeah it is godzilla but theres most likely never going to be an oscar for the actors      i just got back from the newest godzilla movie godzilla minus one   it is excellent and this is one that should be seen in the theaters      now how do you tell an epic story and make it a great movie too  you do it not by telling about the main event but about the people who are in the main event  a good example of this is saving private ryan   if it was just a regular war movie showing nothing but dday it would have been ok but just mediocre   however it was a great movie because it focused not on dday but on one character private ryan and how to get him home      so narrow the story down to one person or just a few      godzilla minus one has done this  it is the story of a japanese kamikaze pilot who chickened out and due to this he has massive guilt  something else happened no spoilers where he chickened out again so now he has to go home to a devastated tokyo that was destroyed by the fire bombing campaign at the end of wwii    the story focuses on him and his new family and about him trying to get over the ptsd of wwii        this is why the new godzilla movie is excellent because it has a great story  it is not just about the giant lizard who shoots nuclear beams
Dec 3 2023,positive,godzilla is terrifying i love that they keep finding ways to keep the story fresh in this one we see the beginnings of godzilla from the point of view of the ordinary people i wish we would have gotten a bit more godzilla action but what we got was new and awesome more please
Dec 3 2023,positive,must watch in imax or at least in theaters in my opinion this is the best movie of this year as well as the best godzillamonster movie ever
Dec 3 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is perhaps the best godzilla movie ever made godzilla is a creature that just wants to destroy everything in its path   the back story is interesting too   i will probably see it again
Dec 3 2023,positive,genuinely might be the best godzilla movie of all time i have watched around 40 0f the 50 or so movies in the franchise and i am confident in saying that this one is the best
Dec 3 2023,positive,it is absolutely the best godzilla movie ever made it has heart has suspense and the special effects is outstanding and godzilla is a badass in this movie its a must see film
Dec 3 2023,positive,fantastic  i cried three times      imagine feeling like an ostracized outcast for not sacrificing your life on two consecutive occasions  you would feel completely alone and worthless  how do you even come back from that  do you sacrifice your life the way everyone seems to demand  what happens to your kid if you do  do you sacrifice yourself for her   what happens to her then      i wont spoil any more for you but thats the kind of stuff the main character deals with  its an all too common story for so many these days and it really hit home for me      thats the kind of deep drama that has been missing from theaters for far too long  american cinema is dead  the japanese just proved it
Dec 3 2023,positive,love that the movie isnt the traditional monster mash movie this godzilla stands out above the rest
Dec 3 2023,positive,great practical effects more movies should be like this take note hollywood bravo japan 
Dec 3 2023,positive,excellent redemption story that happened to have a murderous monster in it

Dec 3 2023,positive,brilliant what godzilla is and always has been about
Dec 3 2023,positive,loved it  terrific cinematic masterpiece not another campy monster movie the story and characters have depth and keeping the original japanese with subtitles preserves the depth of the movie  this is the original story stunningly retold it is one to see in the theater on the big screen

Dec 3 2023,positive,loved this movie cant wait for the sequelno politics or bs in the story at all i think its the first godzilla movie which focused deeply on the characters you actually care about the characters had real emotional depth which surprised me for a godzilla movie i usually just want to see godzilla kill things and smash stuff so so so good and tiny 15m budget wow hollywood disney and the like should wake up and learn that 250m budgets are stupid not necessary unless youre physically building massive sets like an actual replica of the titanic shipcgi costs in the us are way out of control fantastic godzilla movie amazing acting and story im gonna see it again but in imax
Dec 3 2023,positive,absolut blockbuster must see  was going in with lower expectations and was absolutely stunned in the first 10 minutes film keeps pace till the end  good story really good cgi and really good acting perfect sound and music score  went 2x to the cinema second time was as good as first time

Dec 3 2023,positive,this is the best movie i have seen this year  great story and good action it was better than other films that i have seen with 100 million budgets  i would go see it again
Dec 3 2023,positive,i have seen every single godzilla property multiple times im about as an over the top fan of godzilla as you get but recognizing my own bias this is still an amazing movie easily one of the top godzilla films of all time it does what many godzilla movies fall short of accomplishing that is telling a compelling story with godzilla acting as a driving force and unique tool to drive the plot forward and drive home the narrative possibly the best godzilla film since the original 1954
Dec 3 2023,positive,an awesome kaiju epic with emotion as big and strong as godzilla himself perfectly written characters and expertly crafted action scenes will leave you earning for more once the credits begin to roll
Dec 3 2023,positive,probably the best monster movie since jaws exceeded my expectations must watch in theaters
Dec 3 2023,positive,the movie was epic the dbox loungers made it like a ride at a theme park
Dec 3 2023,positive,the human drama is as strong as godzilla great credit goes to director and writer takashi yamazaki for crafting what may be the greatest godzilla movie of all time and just a great movie period the depth and development of the characters is the best ive seen since ishiro hondas original 1954 masterpiece
Dec 3 2023,positive,best godzillakaiju movie ever great story line great effects and great cinematography so much detail throughout had to watch it twice enjoyed it both times

Dec 3 2023,positive,this movie was amazing its definitely a must see i will definitely watch it again 
Dec 2 2023,positive,impressed that this only cost 15 million to make  the worst thing about this movie was the guy eating a bagged lunch next to me
Dec 2 2023,positive,the absolute best godzilla movie in the world
Dec 2 2023,positive,amazing as a godzilla fan since i was a kid from the 1970s this is by far the best japan decided to remind us how godzilla came to be and you also have a heartwarming story to make this more than a monster movie we literally watch the evolution of godzilla as more bombs are exploded on him thank goodness this was subtitled and not dubbed definitely watching this again on the big screen
Dec 2 2023,positive,great movie overall no real complaints
Dec 2 2023,positive,one of the best godzilla movies highly recommended 
Dec 2 2023,positive,it was a really good story with godzilla right in the middle of it  awesome
Dec 2 2023,positive,best godzilla movie ive ever seen the story was shockingly touching good characters the cgi was very good the action was exhilarating and themes were done well the one thing that nags it down is the pacing can be slow at points even though a good story is still being told this is the godzilla ive been waiting for over a decade and it delivered everything i wanted this is what i wanted the 2014 one to be great movie
Dec 2 2023,positive,loved it  cant wait for the bluray release
Dec 2 2023,positive,surprisingly moving some pundits are all action and thats what they want and expect this was human drama and gave you heroes you could identify with and root for it just happened to have a kaiju as the villain but every time that little kid showed up on screen i teared up the plot to defeat godzilla was a little far fetched but its science fiction most scifi is far fetched this movie could even be called a period piece it was of the times reminiscent of postwar japan the costumes the setting the people and their struggles were rooted in realism and those times well acted great special effects a sense of reality a monster movie that works a good time in the theater
Dec 2 2023,positive,absolutely phenomenal a couple of nitpicks here and there but this godzilla fan was very satisfied
Dec 2 2023,positive,this is truly how godzilla is suppose to be   truly the king of the monsters forever
Dec 2 2023,positive,best since 1954  good story
Dec 2 2023,positive,impeccable film its all you could want in a monster film
Dec 2 2023,positive,awesome movie loved it going to see again
Dec 2 2023,positive,godzilla minus one in my opinion did a great homage of the original without spoiling anything the new take of this version was great i understand some people are upset that just like our 1st take on godzilla2014 with the monsterverse then you know the major problem with that movie basically same as this one stoll a great movie though
Dec 2 2023,positive,the plot on how they killed godzilla
Dec 2 2023,positive,the movie was phenomenal this movie is one of the best movies of 2023 the film had a budget of 15 million and portrayed the film with high quality the action story character development cgi and etc were awesome the films godzilla fighting scenes and spectacular human story combined with human emotional connection keeps you and your family engaged from the start to the end of the movie this movie is the top godzilla movie and if not my favorite film of all time by far watch it and learn something in life
Dec 2 2023,positive,loved it will definitely see it again
Dec 2 2023,positive,perfect balance of action set pieces and character drama
Dec 2 2023,positive,growing up and watching raymond burr broadcast godzilla in black  white tv i took my son to watch godzilla minus one in an imax theatre the storyline kept true the roar was a godzilla and the music was from the original now its my sons turn to carry on

Dec 2 2023,positive,incredible movie not just monster movie
Dec 2 2023,positive,still a great movie  different visual impact from the first  gives a more appropriate feel for the time setting
Dec 2 2023,positive,just saw godzilla minus one today and it was the best godzilla movie to date the acting the atmosphere and the characters were all amazing there were a few scenes that made me cry and the main cast do such a magnificent job in there roles and godzilla was a true force to be reckoned with and a true terrifying creature that hasnt been seen since  the 1954 movie this movie is a masterpiece and everyone who are new or old godzilla fans or even casual movie goers are sure to get a kick out of this 1010 movie the best godzilla movie in the decade
Dec 2 2023,positive,the greatest movie ever
Dec 2 2023,positive,this gman movie is nearly perfect certainly the best japanese godzilla since the classic 1954 original great story great acting surprisingly good effects serious  drama no other monsters to make it goofy a new classic that will be hard to beat by hollywood even if you dont like or care about godzilla you will be very glad you saw it
Dec 2 2023,positive,one of the best movies of 2023 definetly best godzilla movies
Dec 2 2023,positive,a magnificent sequel that like last years top gun maverick it may just outshine and outdo its original predecessor
Dec 2 2023,neutral,too much talks  less godzilla action
Dec 2 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is excellent extremely close in style and tone to the original gojira we both loved the acting the storyline and that the monster almost looks like a guy in a 200lb suit it isnt its cgi good g design and one slightly oomphedup g element that screams to be part of the action figure and for some unknown reason isnt there are only a few plot holes that we both handwaved away because godzilla its just over 2 hours long and we both only got restless at about the midpoint suporting characters also wellwritten and acted we also started spontaneously directing the traditional g music when it appeared    as soon as this comes to streaming it gets my money
Dec 2 2023,positive,this is a perfect godzilla movie
Dec 2 2023,positive,a great movie experience this may be the best godzilla film ever
Dec 2 2023,positive,gigantic stakes intense drama wonderful story legendary take notes this is the godzilla movie not just for 20232024 but for the 2020s this is the mountain to scale
Dec 2 2023,positive,godzilla is the ultimate villain  the bringer of death  destruction but humanity continues to fight  the will to survive   godzilla  minus one is by far the greatest kaiju spectacul ever made with a genuine human aspect something that is never been a factor in any godzilla movie

Dec 2 2023,positive,it stays true to the time period love the godzilla scenes
Dec 2 2023,positive,this movie is a must see for any fan of the original godzilla movies  it is a perfect blend of retro theme engaging human stories and awesome effects and sounds  as a veteran i was impressed by the authentic hardware and military customs represented in the movie  godzilla is back
Dec 2 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is a masterpiece that the american monsterverse should take note of  this movie is like the 1954 original movie very dark and makes godzilla scary as hell the cgi has a few issues but that is from what i hear this movie only cost 15 million to make and if that is the case its one of the greatest movies ever made the story is very similar to the 1954 just set right after world war ii which was a great idea   kamiki ryunosuke who is koichi gives an oscar performance as a veteran who is living with ptsd along with minami hamabe who is noriko gives you characters that feel real not like the american versions   the people really sell this movie they are so good every one of them as a veteran at some point i even cried the way everyone portrayed the aftermath was so gripping this is not a typical godzilla movie this is truly and one of a kind movie that must be seen oscar containers all around on this movie
Dec 2 2023,positive,it was excellent movie i enjoyed all cants are great i cried
Dec 2 2023,positive,better than the 1954 original and its not even close tightly written and directed acting good enough to make you forgive subtitles beautiful homages to 54 and gmk best depiction of survivors guilt youll ever see put to film so good im dropping a review and i never do this kind of thing go see this movie you will not be disappointed best thing ive seen in years

Dec 2 2023,positive,a traditional godzilla movie meaning humanity vs a force of nature probably one of the best godzilla movies ever
Dec 2 2023,positive,this is how you tell a story  this is how you develop characters so you actually care about them by movies end      superb movie that does run a bit longbut 100 worth it by the end      a
Dec 2 2023,positive,fantastic film everything you are looking for from a godzilla movie
Dec 2 2023,positive,much much better than expected just as compelling and serious as the original 1954 movie but with the production values and visual effects from the more recent monsterverse fare

Dec 2 2023,positive,outstanding story that keeps you interested in the characters and has you pulling for them against incredible odds probably one of if not the best godzilla film ever made special effects were great even with its much lower budget than a typical hollywood film godzilla is a force to be reckoned with and is terrifying at times and once again shows why he is king of the monsters
Dec 2 2023,positive,the best godzilla movie ever made
Dec 2 2023,positive,the best godzilla ive seen in years godzilla is truly horrifying in a few scenes his face in one scene in particular was one of the scariest monster faces ive ever seen in any franchise not just godzilla i usually dont expect much from the back stories  of godzilla movies but this one was done really well it was well thought out and acted convincingly the back story had real weight and invoked genuine emotions in the audience it brought a tear to my eye at one point and i assure you that is no easy feat this is an independent movie and does not require having seen any other movie in the franchise i would highly recommend this to any fan of monsters or action movies
Dec 2 2023,positive,amazing movie best godzila to ever fill the big screen
Dec 2 2023,positive,one of the best godzilla and movies

Dec 2 2023,positive,godzillaminusone is an incredible film the whole family loved it and cant wait to see it again and again its a masterpiece which will no doubt be racking up nominations come awards season do yourself a favor and see this movie you wont be disappointed
Dec 2 2023,positive,wow best godzilla movie and my best of the year
Dec 2 2023,positive,one of the best godzilla movies ever and one of my favorite movies ever too
Dec 2 2023,positive,i just saw the new movie last night i thought it was fantastic beautiful direction and script the cast did a spectacular job truly a great movie godzilla was pretty scary just like the original 1954 movie
Dec 2 2023,positive,characters were able to keep me involved in their stories even though the amount of screen time for the main antagonist was limited it was spread out enough that you werent wondering where he was or missing his presence
Dec 2 2023,positive,showcases the best traits of humanity against the beast must see movie
Dec 2 2023,positive,there needs to be a rating higher than 5 stars this is an a the humanity and threads of fate and trauma were so perfectly woven together this is how you do a legacy movie this is how you celebrate an anniversary this was sheer perfection on the screen and what movie going should be about
Dec 2 2023,positive,this godzilla is the best version i have ever seen godzillas size makes him menacing and a predator to the people of japan i totally recons watching it
Dec 2 2023,positive,i think that this is the best godzilla movie ever and will stand the rest of time  this rendering godzilla is a must see and its because the story is real and the action is awesome  thats my takeso go see it and enjoy a quality movie for once in a long time
Dec 2 2023,positive,everything youve heard about this being one of the greatest godzilla films ever made is true come hell or high water you need to see this film
Dec 2 2023,positive,a masterclass in not in just monster movies but filmmaking
Dec 2 2023,positive,best godzilla movie so many elements brought into this movie
Dec 2 2023,positive,love story with godzilla
Dec 2 2023,positive,great all around one of the best godzilla films a real must see you dont need 200 million to make a movie good writing and visual effects were amazing
Dec 2 2023,positive,what an absolute masterpiece hands down the best godzilla movie ive seen
Dec 2 2023,positive,finally godzilla gets a movie worthy of him and its actually not about him  dont misunderstand if you like the alpha dog titan stomping and breathing atomic breath youre going to like this but thats a vehicle to move the cast through a poignant story of regaining dignity and burying the ghosts of the past as a boomer i grew up with godzilla and understood very well he was a metaphor for the atomic age  then over time he devolved into  almost a joke  his rebirth in the 2014 godzilla was amazing if you love the monster and a decent enough movie overall but i cant tell you that until today ive seen an actually great piece of cinema in the entirety of the catalog  the 1954 original being maybe the closest  well i have now
Dec 2 2023,positive,this is the godzilla we have all been waiting for where the monster is a monster he is not a good guy and is not interested in being a friend of the people as we have been led to believe in the most recent incarnations  good storytelling fastpaced and a whole lot of fun to watch
Dec 2 2023,positive,return to classic godzilla horror form without a large portion of the cheese the story about the humans around godzilla was much higher quality than most other kaiju films but you absolutely miss the big man when hes off screen and still manage to hate his guts when hes on screen  the second to last scene feels a bit like a cop out of some earlier decisions in the plot id say its mostly an improvement from shin godzilla across the board they took what they learned from shin and really honed it in easily putting this in the conversation for best godzilla film ever
Dec 2 2023,positive,absolutely fantastic
Dec 2 2023,positive,one of the best godzilla movies to date goes back to its original roots and gives us a fresh new take on godzilla
Dec 2 2023,positive,great movie i felt invested in the characters value driven story arch a few nit pick criticisms but on a different level than standard studio drivel
Dec 2 2023,positive,just got home from the cinema and i have to say the movie is really great it has a really good story and the king of monsters has actually quite a lot of screen time and when hes there oh boy i highly recommend to go and watch it for yourselfs i am actually mad at our local cinema that they arent showing it in imax andor 4dx
Dec 2 2023,positive,the best godzilla film in my opinion toho knows how to deliver its golden boy to the world keep it simple godzilla attacks japan and also at sea he is unforgiving and destructive the original roar the human storyline was refreshing and performed perfectly there were scenes that paid homage to the original film i love this movie it brought us back to why we all became godzilla fans legendary started off this way but eventually lost its way as it is no longer the monsterverse its now the kongsterverse thank you for this well made film toho 
Dec 2 2023,positive,i did not expect such a good film in this day and age of big budget disappointments a human story in a monster movie it is possible  makers of this movie have proven that at moments it felt like live action grave of the fireflies its that gripping go see it while you can
Dec 2 2023,positive,hands down the most compelling human story in a godzilla movie of all time while at the same time we get one of the most ferocious and destructive godzillas of all time an absolute mustsee
Dec 2 2023,positive,wow went on a lark wasnt expecting it to be one of the best movies ive seen in ages great monster great fight scenes amazing storyline for the actual humans in the movie highly recommend
Dec 2 2023,positive,the story is strong the humans are actually human and godzilla is godzilla i was satisfied with it 
Dec 2 2023,positive,post war feelings check  godzilla being a complete badass check  good human characters you care for check  first time i actually wanted godzilla dead  if you are a godzilla fan this is a must watch
Dec 2 2023,positive,finally a good kigu moviwith practical effects
Dec 2 2023,positive,loved it  best godzilla ever  great story
Dec 2 2023,positive,whether youre a longtime godzilla fan or someone being dragged to go see this by a longtime godzilla fan this entry in the franchise does not disappoint and exceeds expectations in many ways  godzilla is truly terrifying and the human characters are engaging enough to make you care about them
Dec 2 2023,positive,wow what a great movie very well written a humanistic view of what would happen if godzilla attacked loved how the director pulled this off pays homage to the franchise hey hollywood you should pay attention to what happens when great writing directing and not forcing your political agenda on people does to movie making
Dec 2 2023,positive,grate story and grate animason and music and the famely drama made it hit oooh so harder go and enjoy gojira
Dec 2 2023,positive,just a good well made movie story visuals themes well done
Dec 2 2023,positive,amazing display of using your little budget where it matters how is it possible that this movie looked better with its budget of 15 million than godzilla 2014 with its 160 million the movie is atmospheric looks great great human characters epic score and a godzilla that is with shin godzilla probably the most scary and evil version that japan brought to the big screen give it a watch one of the best movies of the year and definitly one of the best if not the best modern godzilla movie 
Dec 2 2023,positive,just like with shin gojira we finally have another director that truly understands the meaning behind gojira    the horror and trauma of war completely front and center of the plot and driving force behind the story gojira is back as he was originally intended a true manifestation of what the civilians of japan endured in wwii from the actions of both the japanese government and united states from the japanese government abandoning their civilians to starve sacrifice and waste away to the bombings from the united states we can also see this by just witnessing the countless deaths we see on screen    this is a true force of gojira and the unstoppable threat of his mere existence the american godzilla as an idea is nothing compared to gojira    the only thing holding me back from a higher rating is a few instances of poorlyhandled visual effects and the terrible choice for a title name
Dec 2 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is an awesome movie if you can handle subtitles    it has a great story with complex human characters  i dont eant to give to much away but the writing and storytelling is incredible    i definitely recommend it but it is a subtitle movie  the dialog was clean enough that i had no issue keeping up with reading    i cant remember the last movie that i saw in a theater that was this good with such an authentic human story and it is a monster movie
Dec 2 2023,positive,go watch it youll want to watch it again right after
Dec 2 2023,positive,this film was the one godzilla fans have been waiting for a masterpiece in every sense of the word and it derserves consideration from the academy
Dec 2 2023,positive,best godzilla movie to date loved the design and the acting was very good as well 
Dec 2 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is a game changer in how old school movies mixed with todays special effects when even the human element of the storyline is gripping poignant and gee interesting  then that just enhances any monster movie  me and my entire family absolutely loved this flick godzilla is undoubtedly a monster make no mistake  with this movie only costing 15 million to make  hollywood should take heed especially disney and their marvel brand  script is king
Dec 2 2023,positive,loved the cgi and the characters were not cheesy at all the soundtrack was on point if i had one complaint it would be that i wish they would stop showing almost all the scenes with godzilla in trailers leading up to the movie
Dec 2 2023,positive,just came out of a 9am showing and omg this movie is a tear jerker and an absolute emotional roller coaster oh and godzilla is in it and hes an absolute unit my favorite godzilla movie bar none and favorite movie of 2023 this is why we love movies
Dec 2 2023,positive,was awesome great character development godzilla theme score just kicked in at the perfect times
Dec 2 2023,positive,incredible movie with great storyline and returning to godzillas roots with mass destruction    my two kids 10 and 12 loved it   i highly suggest you tell your kids the backdrop beforehand i explained ww2 which they knew about but went into detail on how tokyo was demolished and what kamikaze pilots were and their purpose   subtitles were not an issue for my kids i wouldnt take very young kids tho since there is a story going on besides just a monster that a young child will totally miss out on if they cant read substitutes or have a limited vocabulary     this is more than just a monster movie tho godzilla creature was in fine form  the kamikazes storyline was nicely done   the overall storyline was realistic too and the movie had very few implausible situations which is essential to enjoyment    everyone clapped at the end of the movie and there were all ages there   now i understand the reave reviews and 98 rotten tomato rating
Dec 2 2023,positive,in a movie with awesome kaiju destruction the human element stood out incredibly heavy lessons about humanity and family launches this movie to the top of any list of best godzilla movies
Dec 2 2023,positive,action starts asap the movie doesnt feel like 2 hrs and godzilla is pissed off  great story telling makes you care about all the human characters thats a plus  even non godzilla fans will like it
Dec 2 2023,positive,the film stayed true to the original style of cinematic photography but better great story great acting and godzilla really activates his back and destroys awesome film  great soundtrack also and effects
Dec 2 2023,positive,best godzilla movie ever this comes from a lifelong fan you do not have to be a godzilla fan to enjoy this movie
Dec 2 2023,positive,best godzilla movie by a mile brutal action sequences yet character development whereby you care about characters
Dec 2 2023,positive,it was timeless i highly encourage anyone to see it especially if you liked the original the music is fantastic the human characters are great godzilla is phenomenal and it only used a 15m budget masterfully written pays homage to the original puts modern hollywood to shame
Dec 2 2023,positive,this is not only an amazing godzilla movie its a great movie period we tend to classify godzilla movies in their own category because even if a godzilla movie is called good by fans it typically is a mediocre or bad movie by everyone elses standards  not this one this one is a great movie that really makes you care about the characters being terrorized by a 200ton radioactive dinosaur  its hands down the best toho godzilla movie ever made and ive been a fan since the 70s
Dec 2 2023,positive,breath taking action scenes hep together by gripping character drama
Dec 2 2023,positive,this is literally what a godzilla film should be like and the story with the humans was one of the best stories i have ever seen in my life
Dec 2 2023,positive,lifetime fan of godzilla films toho has rebooted the franchise a handful of times but has always resisted the urge to remake the 1954 film considering it sacred so when they decided to do this finally i was skeptical i can confidentially say as a 40 year fan of the gman its never done this well     theres numerous homages to the 1954 film and some are really really well done this is the best godzilla movie ever and it hurts to say but better than the 54 film this thing was made with love for the franchise and its roots
Dec 2 2023,positive,best modern day godzilla movie toho gets it so right and the human plot is actually great
Dec 2 2023,positive,this is the best godzilla movie ive ever watched and ive pretty much watched them all even those who arent godzilla fans and simply watch it as a high concept disaster movie will be entertained
Dec 2 2023,positive,as a long time godzilla fan i would say this ties with the original for best godzilla movie for me my 10 year old son is a relatively new godzilla fan and he also rated it as his top godzilla movie the movie is great for a wide range of ages and familiarities with the franchise the characters are easy to become invested in even my 10 year old was unsure if he was rooting for godzilla or the protagonists by the end of the movie i cannot recommend highly enough
Dec 2 2023,positive,good movie a lot of overacting but entertaining though the creature was a little slow moving overall a good movie
Dec 2 2023,positive,not just the best movie of the toho franchise but a fantastic movie in general if there is not a best foreign film oscar nomination the system is broke   this film deserves the 100
Dec 2 2023,positive,this this is how you make a zilla movie  hollywood take note
Dec 2 2023,negative,wish i rate it at 0 kamikaze really i wonder what ww ii fallen heroes would say about this movie
Dec 2 2023,positive,this is truly one of the best movies ive ever seen godzilla is absolutely terrifying and the humans are equally as compelling i have no words for how amazed and happy i felt leaving this movie im a life long godzilla fan and seeing a godzilla movie this good was so refreshing
Dec 2 2023,positive,didnt see enough  of godzilla
Dec 2 2023,negative,movie was so mid my asian gf called it mid 1 a total of 56 times in 2 hours
Dec 2 2023,positive,the best modern godzilla film
Dec 2 2023,positive,i struggle to think of anything that i dislike about this film     despite my 5 stars this isnt a perfect film make no mistake  i wish we saw more godzilla the water effects at times were a bit meh especially regarding the foam     but i left the cinema feeling happy and satisfied this is a great film that i have to nitpick to find fault with it the acting was incredible the characters were likeable and fleshed out i felt for the characters godzillas actions were terrifying  i felt like the characters were on the precipice of death  without feeling overwhelmed and smothered by hopelessness  in fact i felt the opposite  hope a really powerful message  which perhaps towards the end gets a little obvious  but my oh my  this film earns its ending    55  a must watch for godzilla fans  a must watch for monster movies fans
Dec 2 2023,positive,awesome movie especially liked that the story was more about the people than godzilla the special effects were great
Dec 2 2023,positive,it is officially the golden age of godzilla never before have we had such consistent quality godzilla content its been building since godzilla 2014 and it just peaked    godzilla minus one is perhaps the greatest godzilla film since the original there is an argument for it being considered the best better than godzilla 54 this godzilla fires on all cylinders not just as a creature but the movie as a whole godzilla himself is perfect but everything else in the movie is held to that same standard there is no weak part the humans are just as important as goji and their stories are more compelling than the giant radioactive lizard at one point i genuinely forgot it was a godzilla movie and i had to remind myself goji was going to return and bring death and destruction with him    this version of godzilla is like nothing weve seen before he is not an animal he is not a force of nature he is worse pick any god of death destruction andor annihilation and he is that idea brought to life he is malicious at every opportunity he is the most menacing weve ever seen godzilla he is more powerful and destructive than any previous versions of godzilla any scenes with goji attacking are outstanding nothing is held back and surprisingly the effects are done so well they stand up to aaa hollywood films his heat ray is breathtaking its so beautiful and destructive seeing this in theaters is a must the sound design and visuals do a fantastic job making you feel the sheer power being unleashed    everything about this film hit ive never been so proud to be a godzilla fan the story the plot the acting the characters the themes the action the destruction godzillas design the sound design the soundtrack everything for this film is done with care with effort nothing falls short you could take godzilla out of this film and everything else would still stand tall on its own i genuinely think this will win awards and will usher in a new age of japanese cinema hollywood should be taking notes on how to make lower budget movies its mind blowing that a japanese film with a 1520 million budget was better than any 200 million hollywood film that came out this year    i could praise this movie for days straight im going to go see it again and bring everyone i can with me to the theaters its hard to rate a movie as perfect but this movie is as perfect as any movie has been this year    if you like historical dramas go see this film    if you like massive destruction sequences go see this film    if you like godzilla go see this film    if you like good movies go see this film    dont miss maybe the best movie of 2023
Dec 2 2023,positive,one of the best godzilla movies ive seen  the characters were so well done and definitely the best atomic blast ever for godzilla
Dec 2 2023,positive,new favorite godzilla movie so done with the modern oh its a monster better send in the marines and maybe a nuke merica hoorah we got characters we really care about not just if they live or die but if they can work through their trauma post ww2 its never so dark we cant see the action to save on cgi  civillians not governments taking care of business  its goofy its tense its got heart its got a killer bossbattle soundtrack yeah  watch this one
Dec 2 2023,positive,an epic yet emotionally grounded and heartfelt film   easily one of my top three favorite godzilla films of all time    if you can see it in imax
Dec 2 2023,positive,amazing awesome great movie thanks
Dec 2 2023,positive,main story very good with multiple excellent subplots
Dec 2 2023,positive,the best godzilla film to date
Dec 2 2023,positive,a very well done homage to the original film if youre thinking of seeing it go you wont be disappointed
Dec 2 2023,positive,a truly phenomenal film that manages to be on par with the original 1954 film the film was able to give us a great story and human characters that you actually come to care about with a budget of 15 million this film gives us beautiful effects that put the higher budget films to shame if you are a fan of godzilla do yourself a favor and go see this movie asap
Dec 2 2023,positive,an excellent story with developed characters and clever themes
Dec 2 2023,positive,very satisfying the movie has a story line that is strong and maintains its connection to its roots
Dec 2 2023,positive,one of if not the best godzilla movie i have ever seen along with that it is an amazing tribute to the franchise
Dec 2 2023,positive,i was born in the early fifties and remembered the first godzilla movie this was a fresh remake of the original with a great story line  i related to the line up of actors in a way which made the movie even more enjoyable having spent time in japan  definitely would recommend
Dec 2 2023,positive,one of the best films to come out of this year 1010
Dec 2 2023,positive,amazing this is the godzilla we all have been waiting forwell worth the ticket price will see it again on the big screen
Dec 2 2023,positive,a phenomenal and heartwarming movie of redemption the story of survivors guilt and dealing with ptsd should hit home and inspire and btw godzilla was in it the action scenes were more engaging and realistic than any cgi or digitized work could ever capture one truly feels the horror and destructive power in each and every encounter absolutely the best godzilla movie i have ever seen and one of the best movies period in the last 25 years this one should go in for oscar contention under at least best foreign film but more appropriately under best film i would pay to see this at least a couple more times
Dec 2 2023,positive,an excellent film due to fine acting of characters the viewer truly relates to and cares for    imax is wholly unnecessary for screening because of that a theater room with strong audio may aid in evoking emotional response but so could one playing in mono    and such an impression extends to visuals a larger screen does not at all evoke response acting does visually at one point a viewer may wish that director takashi yamazaki had put someone in a rubber godzilla suit letting the viewers imagination further work however one begins to see that the creatures cgi deliberately made to look as if someone is in just such a rubber suit is thoughtfully done in respectful homage to the original 1954 godzilla film yamazaki proves that creativity can and does exist even when barraged by current digital special effects and at less expense than that spent by the us film industry    the storyline and dialogue also could be anime  right down to the happily ever after ending  yet truly fit into the classical kaiju mold in which they brilliantly portray the life of a young family and postwwii japanese community    and this film is edited well never once does one wonder how much time remains before credits    overall godzilla minus one is a jubilant shock at how enjoyable a movie  can be after years of drudging superhero special effects stories where thischanges nothing but ones pocketbook
Dec 2 2023,positive,excellent the japanese prove that hollywood studios should just stop trying to make these movies godzilla minus one has a ton of heart and will make you care for the characters godzilla tearing up a city and sinking ships is just a bonus
Dec 2 2023,positive,moviereview godzillaminusone     it was a fun movie its not in english whatsoever so prepare for that     but like i said its a fun movie its not exciting to the point you get out of your seat and the storyline is drawn out and drug out for over two hours     and the downfall of godzilla is hes hardly in the movie and when he is in the movie action sequences are good but its when hes in the movie     he has less screen time than the actors in the movie is called godzilla 
Dec 2 2023,negative,best sleep i had in a long time all subtitles  and monster fights were about 25 of the movie
Dec 2 2023,positive,in terms of tone this one is like the original 54 godzilla none of the other gmovies come close to this darker tone   and honestly it might even surpass the original in its athomsphere  the movie manages to present likable characters something that a lot of gmovies fail to deliver  that you root for and you root against godzilla the monster sequwences delivered the score was great  i think this might be the best movie of the year and is a strong contender for best godzilla movie ever
Dec 2 2023,positive,i was made to actually care about the human characters and their struggle something previous godzilla films failed to do stakes were high and i was actually scared that someone important might end up dying a twist happy end was refreshing to see
Dec 2 2023,positive,it was great action packed and so much destruction i think it could be one of the best godzilla films ever and thats saying alot altho the story is a bit sad they do the characters so well godzilla is a beast in this film hes not good hes not bad hes just straight up a monster it is pretty similar to shin godzilla but the story in my opinion is better overall this is a great movie and i highly recommend it to anyone rather if your a godzilla fan or not youll still have a blast
Dec 2 2023,positive,after growing up in the early 70s and watching war of the gargantuas and all the other godzilla movies i cherish this is movie has made it to my 1 monster movie its awesome enjoy it
Dec 2 2023,positive,great movie best godzilla ive seen in a while
Dec 2 2023,positive,the human story was beautiful and affecting the effects were marvelous godzilla was truly monstrous intentional in its destruction and it was delightful     my main complaint was that the movie needed more godzilla
Dec 2 2023,positive,one if not the greatest godzilla movie by far shin godzilla had brought back the original concept for the monster and honestly i never thought they would have made a similar movie since legendary was currently making the newest series of godzilla movies toho really went back to the drawing board to make godzilla the terrifying creature he once was back in 1954 hes not your hero or antihero in this film but a monster of pure terror and destruction that symbolizes the immense power of an atomic bomb given life it had a compelling story with some good action with godzilla the best way i can personally describe this movie is that its a war movie feeling the aftermath of wwii and the country now had to defend itself with whatever army it has left against an unknown creature that came about from the attack of the war itself
Dec 2 2023,positive,i wont make a super long review here because i think i can sum this up in a few sentences godzilla minus one is the best godzilla to date it holds its own against hollywoods version visually its got the best story with touching moments and wonderful actors the best version of godzilla and gives you a very satisfying ending imo go see this immediately and support goji in japan and in america i believe both are amazing and i cant wait to see what the sequel might be godzilla minus one is second to no one 910 final score and the best movie ive seen all year goji is back and better than ever in japan
Dec 2 2023,positive,film was amazing toho did godzilla justice as one would expect of toho bravo
Dec 2 2023,positive,lots of scenes played like scenes from jaws except for about 20 minutes moved along rather well lots of action in the daytime i loved it one of the  best godzilla movies ever will most likely see it again its rare to get a togo godzilla movie in the us  the boat and land scenes rank with the best of the best
Dec 2 2023,positive,it was a great reimaging of the classic 1954 gojira will see again and again
Dec 2 2023,positive,a true masterpiece finally a godzilla movie where we actually care about the human characters of course the godzilla mayhem scenes are also brilliantly executed
Dec 2 2023,positive,incredible movie the best godzilla movie ever made you would never know this movie was made with a 15 million dollar budget the story was powerful the acting was fantastic the subtitles were easy to follow and godzilla was angry cant wait to see it again
Dec 2 2023,positive,great movie even if godzilla wasnt in it
Dec 2 2023,positive,not only is it the best godzilla movie ever but a great movie in general its thrilling action packed emotional and very entertaining film
Dec 2 2023,positive,great movie loved the human story easy the second best godzilla movie besides 1954 godzilla 910
Dec 2 2023,positive,great movie and well done
Dec 2 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is a competent wellshot addition to the series  although its much better than any of the drivel produced by legendary pictures it still leaves much to be desired  good acting is offset by terribly written dialogue and theres plenty of dubious cgi on display throughout the film  the human drama is at the forefront  with the titular kaiju taking a backseat to what is a decent although ploddingly paced story  overall a decent film and easily within the top halfdozen godzilla films but it cant contend with a masterpiece like the 1954 original or a gripping contemporary take like shin godzilla   not bad just severely overhyped
Dec 2 2023,positive,love that they show godzilla a lot and great story
Dec 2 2023,positive,they made godzilla scary again a must see for fans of classic kaiju movies all successfully done on a small budget
Dec 2 2023,positive,it was so peakkk if you want to see a exhilarating kajiu movie with a actual good story watch this
Dec 2 2023,positive,the best godzilla movie the world has ever seen and one of the best movies of 2023  a must see
Dec 2 2023,positive,the classic theme song of godzilla hits home again this movie brought back how truly destructive godzilla is as a walking natural disaster bringing back the sobering reminder godzilla is not here to protect us but to destroy us 1010
Dec 2 2023,positive,this is the movie of the year  itll take your breath away
Dec 2 2023,positive,by god was this movie beautiful down from the characters being some of the most compelling to the story that talks about overcoming fear and living for the future to the monster godzilla a great tribute to the kaiju he was from the 50s it was simply remarkable and deserves all the love its getting go go godzilla
Dec 2 2023,positive,this movie gives us a peek into japan after ww2 that we rarely get to see the mix of defeat japan had after ww2 and the search for a identity brought together by the need to defeat godzilla who is rampaging throw a country finding its identity the clash of war and peace identity and obscurity to build a new japan as reality of what happened moves them forward to a new japan as much as this is a story about a monster it is also a story about the people trying to grow past ww2 and the culture during the war to achieve self worth again for a bright future of japan godzilla represents victory of achieving this goal of a new identity by doing it better for a brighter future
Dec 2 2023,positive,a must seeeeeeee  my wife and 3 year old son loved the movie great story that makes it a memorable film
Dec 2 2023,positive,i just want to say that holywood needs to see this masterpiece and realize how movies need to be made this is the best godzilla movie so far story special effects cinematography everything is superb acting  and characters this is a movie about aggressive devastating godzilla you feel the power and real threat when he is in the scene i did not felt boring during the whole movie this is one of the best thrilling and engaging stories with complex characters in godzilla film yet i cannot recommend this movie enough and all of that on 15 million budget hello the marvels anyone thank god for this movie because after trash like the marvels napoleon silent nightetc this is a superb movie and must watch
Dec 2 2023,positive,i use to love watching godzilla movies as a child with my grandpa this godzilla movie felt new and captured the old personality of the original japanese godzilla films the cgi was amazing and they gave this godzilla the personality of the original ones before cgi story was great and the ww2 era was a perfect setting for it i hope they make a sequel for this
Dec 2 2023,positive,loved this movie might be better than the 1954 original enjoyable story satisfying action there really isnt anything i disliked about it this movie then the original and the brian cranston godzilla movies are the most enjoyable of all the godzilla movies
Dec 2 2023,positive,a good movie for subtitles although there was not enough godzilla in the movie there was too much focus placed on the subplots than on the main character i suppose this was because of budget constraints but it would have been nice to see the movie feature more of the main character lastly this godzilla was probably the most stiff one ive seen again likely the result of the budget
Dec 2 2023,positive,i can only find very minor nitpicky things wrong with this movie outside the monster story the movie holds up as a welltold compelling story of post war japan ptsd and post war recovery efforts in a devastated society this would have been enough but they added a giant angry monster and its awesome    the small moments of homage to the original are sweet reminders to us godzilla veterans and an amazing introduction to all the new fans this movie will bring in    the acting is top notch the effects are flawless when they need to be and the pacing is how a big budget monster movie should be once again japan takes a film genre and establishes a new baseline for everyone else to reach for
Dec 2 2023,positive,as a following of godzilla as a kid and having watched every possible media production the film is the single greatest and terrifying godzilla film produced such raw and touching human impacts on japankind i cant wait til he lands on us soil and nukes san francisco or new york imagine the destruction fear him run from him as there is nothing you can do to stop him humankinds reset is coming
Dec 2 2023,positive,really takes you back to the monsters roots for americans we see godzilla as more of a defender and just fighting other monsters so this is a breath of fresh air human story had me engaged and invested the entire way through overall amazing experience
Dec 2 2023,positive,me and my 5 year old enjoyed the hell out of this movie i cannot wait for this to be available to buy to own
Dec 2 2023,positive,this version of godzilla combines the best parts of all godzillas into one terrifying beast the human story is poignant and there is a good balance between it and godzilla screen time in fact i grew to care for the characters so much the thought of another run in with godzilla felt as scary as it did exiting theres a real sense of building tension throughout the whole movie that leads to deservedly satisfying end
Dec 2 2023,positive,what a novel take on the classic godzilla storyline it was a great humancentered epic with some great acting felt incredibly realistic and it made the intesity that much better
Dec 2 2023,positive,great movie good acting and dramatic godzilla movie must see
Dec 2 2023,positive,im a godzilla fan so i wouldnt have missed this in the theater   what i walked away with is a masterpiece of a movie  the plotstory is simply amazing   this is by far the best godzilla movie made to date and they did it for 15m   proof again you dont have to spend 300m to make a great movie
Dec 2 2023,positive,i have been watching godzilla movies since i was a kid in the 80s this movie gave me everything i felt the others were lacking    a great overall message a great connection to the cast great practical effects mixed with modern cgi techniques scary with thrills     this film for me is the best godzilla movie ever made
Dec 2 2023,positive,would watch again and then again
Dec 2 2023,positive,2023s godzilla minus one is essentially a faithful remakeretelling of the 1954 original keeping  instilling the message  morals of the original film whereas the original film focused more on godzilla  the destruction of japan with the struggle  emotions of the japanese people being more the backdrop to the main characters of the original film ie godzilla  the city itself minus one however subverts this expectation and focuses more on character development with the human characters themselves the screen time we do get of godzilla rampaging throughout japan  the destruction he causes though more breif than i was wanting is a sight to be hold and leaves a significant impact just wish there was more of it
Dec 2 2023,positive,love this movie love love love it my favorite godzilla ever and i am 49 beautiful work
Dec 2 2023,positive,great movie highly recommend 
Dec 2 2023,positive,this may be the best movie ive ever seen and i dont speak a lick of japanese i was unaware the movie was only in japanese and subtitled for english i was shocked at the heart of this film as i was expecting a run of the mill monster movie this movie has such great acting and emotion and heart to it im recommending this to everyone excellent score as well this movie is powerful
Dec 2 2023,positive,excellent movie great cast good story 
Dec 2 2023,positive,a wonderful monster movie i really compelling human story as well
Dec 2 2023,positive,by far the greatest godzilla movie since the 1954 original  great human story terrifying monster story
Dec 2 2023,positive,if you are a godzilla fan then this is a must see movie   be warned it is a fully japanese film with subtitles so if you arent into that you may want to wait for a dubbed version but the film is worth watching this way if you can do it     while the film is not perfect theres quite a few things lost in translation and there are a few choices in how it is put together that i would have done differently its still a great movie   if you just want a mindless monster movie like the legendary pictures godzilla you will likely not enjoy this one as much this is more of the thinking mans godzilla like the original   but if you are a fan of godzillas classic storytelling and solid themes that are heavy in morality emotion and thoughtfulness then this is a film to see in big screen   this one evokes the best format of godzilla the eminent threat to and enemy of humanity that we have to struggle to deal with and it touches at the heart and soul of the original film and all its successors into shin gojira   the characters and archetypes are fun though predictable but they are more about carrying the message and theme of the film rather than being fully fleshed out entities   the visuals are gorgeous and really nail the time period feeling and make godzilla feel threatening and savage theres some truly awesome moments in there and some legit tense scenes     the main drawback i have is with the pacing especially early on as we dont really get to know the characters they simply drop in which is a bit of a letdown and sometimes confusing     overall i would definitely give this a recommend i would have been more comfortable with a 45 star rating but i felt it deserves more than 4 for what the director cast and crew accomplished
Dec 2 2023,positive,absolutely amazing  best godzilla story of them all incredible acting cinematography music and so realistic you didnt feel compelled to look for things that looked fake  wonderful story line
Dec 2 2023,positive,rivals the classic original as a powerful exploration of atomic horror via an allegorical force of nature
Dec 2 2023,positive,ive been a lifelong fan of godzilla but i was skeptical of this at first but upon watching it i was immediately immersed in this phenomenal cinematic experience it has all the depth emotions and scale you could possibly want from any great movie also the music was amazing overall i rank this movie a 1110 but since its godzilla minus one i guess that makes it a 1010
Dec 2 2023,positive,we went and saw godzilla minus one  its not only a great godzilla movie its also a good movie  the special effects look great the big g has never looked better and as a bonus the human characters are also interesting and have a good story line  the film is in japanese and you have to read subtitles but it doesnt distract from it  as a movie id give it a 75 or 8  as a godzilla movie its easily the best one  even better than the japanese version of the original
Dec 2 2023,positive,the most terrifying godzilla ever epic in every sense of the word great human characters as well
Dec 2 2023,positive,an excellent film that also happens to have godzilla in it well worth watching
Dec 2 2023,positive,very emotional and extremely masterful work of art
Dec 2 2023,positive,breathtaking godzilla is a beast and the story is one ill remember forever so happy to see toho keeping godzilla alive
Dec 2 2023,positive,godzilla such a great movie and storyline it gave 1954 vibes with a modern look go see it
Dec 2 2023,positive,beautifully crafted moving story excellent movie cant wait to own it
Dec 2 2023,positive,it is truly a godzilla that symbolizes the current era has there ever been a godzilla that excited me as much as this one it was wonderful
Dec 2 2023,positive,perfection from beginning to end gut wrenching destructive visually engaging incredible sound design music writing and a hopeful optimism for a brighter tomorrow this film has all the characteristics of a good godzilla film and maybe more i dont know what the future holds but i want more much more
Dec 2 2023,positive,okay now this godzilla is really standing on business    but seriously this was incredible the biggest and loudest godzilla movie ive seen and to have a 15m budget is very impressive definitely see this on the biggest screen
Dec 2 2023,positive,it was in japanese and i dont speak a lick what an  amazing movie visually musically just extremely well put together and had all the feels too i cried laughed and just really enjoyed it
Dec 2 2023,positive,its classic godzilla only toho can do justice heartfelt storytelling plus amazing visuals music and sound mindblowing that this film have a megabudget look and feel yet was produced on a budget of 15 million which by hollywood standards is low low budget

Dec 2 2023,positive,this is the monster movie that future monster movies will be measured this is the godzilla movie you show to someone who has never seen a godzilla movie  outstanding
Dec 2 2023,positive,a must watch this movie was fantastic if youre on the fence due to the subtitles this is your sign to bite the bullet and watch this fantastic film godzilla is an epic force to be reckoned with but the japanese people rally together and combat sheer force and power with strategy and wit definitely one of the best movies i have watched in a few years go see it now
Dec 2 2023,positive,it is a godzilla movie with a ton of character development and not a lot of kaiju action imho  granted when godzilla is on the screen its pretty awesome but hes not on much for a kaiju movie  godzilla does have the most awesome new atomic breath ive ever seen  i mean it is so wickedly wild that no other kaiju would want to be on the receiving end of it  yet most of the movie is more of a character study with godzilla as more of an afterthought at times  i mean it is about people living in japan right after wwii  its a decent movie but not a hardcore kaiju one for me  one thing about it is that the japanese military isnt in it much  after wwii they didnt have much working weapons and as part of the treaty were required to remove weapons from vessels etc  so godzilla goes up against homemade stuff vice the laser cannons etc from previous movies
Dec 2 2023,positive,this movie was just awesome we kaiju fans havent seen something like this for awhile godzilla is just evil hes really trying to kill people in this movie awesome call backs to the original 1954 as well and you actually care for the people havent seen that since 1954 the characters were wonderful they have a purpose to survive just amazing and sad as well this movie 5 stars an incredible story in this movie instant classic right next to the original 1954 godzilla and godzilla just awesome in this movie and to my fellow kaiju fans go watch it its worth it and to none kaiju fans go watch it youll like it as well  godzilla 1 the best movie of this year hands down oh ps dont listen to adam olinger this is from the guy who liked the marvels

Dec 2 2023,positive,the greatest godzilla movie ever made
Dec 2 2023,positive,i figured out how this movie was made so cheap godzillas arms dont move  i cant believe an english subtitle godzilla movie made me tear up twice hollywood should take notice when this godzilla movie turns a solid profit
Dec 2 2023,positive,i have been a godzilla fan my whole life i saw broderick godzilla in theaters i rented them all from the library this is the best of the best see it on the biggest screen you can

Dec 2 2023,positive,this movie exceeded all expectations the toho team took advantage of all the technology available now and brought gojira to its full potential 1010
Dec 2 2023,positive,this was a great movie so intense so good
Dec 2 2023,positive,minis one is definitely better than most modern movies and it is better than the western tellings of the godzilla story however the pacing is slow and it drags i several places two hours was too long for the movie but that two was substantive i just wish moviemakers learn to tell a coherent story in less time other than the runtime if you are a fan of godzilla redemption stories and alternative history pieces this isa movie for you
Dec 2 2023,positive,i grew up watching godzilla movies in the 70s so i went into this particular godzilla movie with a chip on my shoulder what can you show me new about godzilla i thought to myself this movie superseded my expectations its rare to see godzilla upstaged by the human characters often in godzilla movies the human characters are just used as a segway between the godzilla scenes you will have to read the subtitles however you get to see the movie in its original language which only adds to the movie
Dec 2 2023,positive,terrific i was completely vested in the characters the writing was sharp and the cinematography was beautiful absolutely one of the best movies of the year
Dec 2 2023,positive,man japan makes far better movies than hollywood nowadays great story great acting likable characters and the best godzilla ive seen
Dec 2 2023,positive,godzilla minus one was a tremendous film absolutely one of tohos greatest godzilla films of alltime the plot was hugely characterdriven and it was one of the films best attributes especially in relation to the plot and its most intense moments not to mention the beautiful special effects treatment they gave godzilla himself easily one of the best films of 2023 for me
Dec 2 2023,positive,this version of godzilla is refreshing to see as the japanese take on this kaiju is a contrast to the american rendition of godzilla for those unfamiliar with the foreignoriginal take on godzilla this film is a good modern entryway into the decades of godzilla movies produced under toho the monsters presence also sets the basis for human conflictchallenges played by wellknown actors in the japanese film industry
Dec 2 2023,positive,this is probably one of the best godzilla movies ever made right up there with the original from 54 its visual story telling is top notch godzilla looks great the human characters felt relatable that i empathized with what they going through a must watch for fans of giant monster movies  if you just like good movies in general
Dec 2 2023,positive,movie full of depth and plot with the characters loved it
Dec 2 2023,positive,one of the first movies in years to bring me to the verge of tears this movie does three things first it beautifully incapsulates the horrors of destruction and trauma that plagued post wwii japan along with the hope and recovery of the country second it shows a gripping story about human characters in a monster movie that add to the plot rather than just be there for the ride thus succeeding where many monster movies fail third it is an absolutely awesome monster movie and a phenomenal modern rendition of the original godzilla movie with all the horror and despair that the original created just with the addition of modern day cinematography capabilitys if you can do watch it as it is worth it
Dec 2 2023,positive,i watched it last night it was great
Dec 2 2023,positive,i love how they brought the old godzilla back makes you feel like a kid again watching the big g man causing mayhem wherever he walks 1010 would recommend to anyone who is or isnt a g fan to watch this movie

Dec 2 2023,positive,the best godzilla film yet
Dec 2 2023,positive,this is a godzilla movie that surprisingly has some of the best human characters in the entire series and they deliver powerful performances godzilla was just the icing on the cake he is scary as well as pure evil some fans might find it slow but i found the humans exceptional good and the godzilla attacks were incredible most fans will be in heaven
Dec 2 2023,positive,amazing acting and special effects with great engaging storytelling with only a 10 million dollar budget puts hollywood movies to shame
Dec 2 2023,positive,beautiful doesnt describe this masterpiece first time bowing to a film after the credits let alone a japanese film i cant recommend this more to godzilla fans and those who have never watched or care to watch godzilla movies this is a beautiful introduction to the franchise on par with the og movie that birthed the franchise
Dec 2 2023,positive,the movie was an absolutely amazing nod to the original with even small nods to the english version the way godzilla moved the use of his iconic theme everything was so amazingly placed and crafted and carefully placed    the story for the human characters was very emotional and while you can probably guess the story beats at points with it it still was impactful all the same    i cannot stress enough how well put together of a film this was
Dec 2 2023,positive,i grew up on godzilla and this is hands down the best movie made it has an amazingly deep and layered plot minus greatness doesnt diminish prior films just simply brings more to the table with its human perspective and representation of postwar life trauma godzilla is the destructive force and monstrous terror that has been lost through the years
Dec 2 2023,positive,this isnt just an extraordinary godzilla movie its an extraordinary movie  everything is firing on all cylinders the script the pacing the effects and especially the acting i cant wait to see it again
Dec 2 2023,negative,i didnt like the return to the older format of godzilla and i still prefer godzilla the hero    however i can appreciate what they did but it did not appeal to me  
Dec 2 2023,positive,the storytelling and godzilla looked old school amazing
Dec 2 2023,positive,best movie ive seen bye far this year definitely recommend 
Dec 2 2023,positive,the king of monsters triumphs flawlessly even after 70 years of release of the very first movie in 1954
Dec 2 2023,positive,it was near perfect  one of the best godzilla movies ever made maybe the best  great movie
Dec 2 2023,positive,as someone who does not watch many monster movies godzilla minus one was an incredible cinema experience the film perfectly balanced action tension and emotion every minute was captivating godzilla was a visual spectacle the human characters were wonderfully written and acted the cinematography was sharp and the score was both suspenseful and beautiful i highly recommend watching this on the big screen for its immersive surround sound even if you are not familiar with any godzilla films this stands alone as one of the best films this year
Dec 2 2023,positive,not just one of the best godzilla films ever but one of the greatest films of the year
Dec 2 2023,positive,best godzilla since the first
Dec 2 2023,positive,godzilla was pure evil truly a monster great character development and story telling

Dec 2 2023,positive,exciting and emotional movie by far one of the best godzilla movies
Dec 2 2023,positive,an amazing edition to the godzilla verse
Dec 2 2023,positive,absolutely phenomenal godzilla movie by far the most intense portrayal of the king of monsters to date the acting was superb leaving me choking back tears and bursting out laughing multiple times throughout the film the intensity of godzillas presence is unsettling in the best way and the action scenes left me feeling a sense of awe and hopelessness for the people facing his wrath everything made sense and it feels like godzilla has finally achieved a proper portrayal in modern cgi 1010
Dec 2 2023,positive,great story powerful acting godzilla is a beast this wont be the godzilla movie you were expecting and youll be glad its not
Dec 2 2023,positive,a fantastic godzilla film with a great human story as well as a violent and mean godzilla
Dec 2 2023,positive,i just witnessed one of the greatest films ever made much less best godzilla movie ever the hype was real for the 100 on rottentomatoes godzilla minus one    this movie has so much depth due to the deep character driven storyline of a failed disgraceful  kamikaze pilot who returns to nothing only to take on hope through a orphaned child and wily woman who he slowly falls for yet his internal war of shame and pain rages too much within himself to even love anyone anymore only to almost be redeemed by love but only to loss it all  then willing to fight to the death for revenge by being the most dangerous monster a person could be suicidal to deal with the biggest monster of them all godzilla which as always represents the fears and demons of the main character only to bring things back full circle to hope    absolutely brilliant action with godzilla stellar story and the best movie of 2023 and it should be nominated in the oscars for best film also  the best 4d movie of 2023 glad to watch one of the best movies ive ever seen in 4d  with fam    better than 90 of hollywood trash movies out there now and before
Dec 2 2023,positive,one of the best godzilla films
Dec 2 2023,positive,i was really blown away by how compiling and gripping the storyline was to see how unbelievable aweful post ww2 japan was and how they made do was very moving this godzilla was incredible menacing and evil i will own this movie when it makes its steaming premiere
Dec 2 2023,positive,finally justice for godzilla  this is more appropriate the peter jacksons king kong
Dec 2 2023,positive,i have been a godzilla fan for over 31 years at this point i have seen every film in the series ive been lucky enough to see godzilla 98 godzilla 2000 millennium godzilla 14 shin godzilla and godzilla king of the monsters in the cinema so it was a genuine treat to see godzilla minus one i live in the middle of nowhere so it was an hour long drive but the drive home was good thinking time     this movie has opinions it has very clear things to say about war valuing life and individual peoples role in society it has big acting huge displays of human emotion consider the collective strain and trauma and how overwhelmed youd been in these situations     luckily for us the big acting is attached to legitimately interesting characters who you dont want to see get squashed by godzilla because for the first time in a long time godzilla is a dick this verison of godzilla reminds me of godzilla mothra king ghidorah giant monsters all out attack 2001 in how much he just hates if he sees a person that person dies unless they get away or at least out of sight he will tolerate none in his way     to continue i echo much of what youve probably already read impressive visual effects especially for the budget the plot is good and you have characters you like the score is not overly dependent on ifukube but the expected themes are there and they are exceptional updates the original music is generally good with a few haunting themes i liked the sound design was great actually and i liked when the film chose to slow down and be quiet for a few minutes     fans of the godzilla series will probably notice the nods to the past and i feel that it was done well with the easter eggs being fairly subtle rather than overtly shoved in your face     if youre only familiar with the legendary monsterverse godzilla this movie is very different this is a postwwii antiwar drama about survivors guilt ptsd found family and the value of human life there just happens to be some incredible monster scenes and exciting action scenes but its a drama i loved it go see it while its in theaters
Dec 2 2023,positive,this movie has a beautiful story and at times you almost forget youre watching a monster movie the actors are fantastic and some scenes are very emotional godzilla himself is more terrifying than ever and there is plenty of action to move this movie along
Dec 2 2023,positive,best godzilla movie ever watched

Dec 2 2023,positive,some folks have complained about godzillas cg being poor quality but as i watched the movie i felt like this was done on purpose  it harkens back to old school 50s and 60s godzilla and it felt like a tribute i teach psychology and this movie does an incredible job of realistically portraying ptsd you feel so strongly for shikishima and his continued plight i was literally breathless when we see godzilla take out the first destroyer and use his atomic breath from underwater amazing costume and set design  everything felt real and authentic incredible movie

Dec 2 2023,positive,a must watch masterpiece i went in expecting to feel meh but this was gripping suspenseful and made me tear up this isnt just another mindless movie like the hollywood godzilla films im watching the movie again in theaters and buying the dvd i never see movies twice in theaters and never buy physical copies it was that good
Dec 2 2023,positive,this movie blew me away it was by far the best godzilla film to date it was poignant true to the original music and historically beautiful i did not expect this how refreshing to watch a nonwoke movie that left a lasting historical impression the costumes the sets the actors all fantastic

Dec 2 2023,positive,the best godzilla movie to come out thus far great story great characters and amazing vfx with a budget of only 15 million dollars
Dec 2 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is a solid godzilla movie but also a surprisingly well crafted drama about post war japan courage family unity and survival loved it  my issues were some of the over acting odd cg choices and the somewhat sloppy introduction of godzilla
Dec 2 2023,positive,hands down one of the best godzilla movies ever made one of the best human interest stories in a godzilla movie too
Dec 2 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is the best godzilla movie since the original no i am not kidding this film is beyond anything then i ever expected im more than happy i got to see this masterpiece in theaters if you havent seen this film yet i greatly encourage you to see it immediately it tugs and pulls at your heartstrings way more than youd ever expect the human characters are such an amazing part of this film that it brought me to tears several times the special effects are gorgeous and you feel every ounce of power theyve given godzilla in the film he is the king of the monsters and hes felt in every aspect of this movie
Dec 2 2023,positive,this really hit my childhood this is exactly what you expect a godzilla movie to be plus more amazing story characters horror and my god this is peek godzilla there were some parts that were a little too unrealistic but this is a monster film after all will definitely be watching again
Dec 2 2023,positive,great movie interesting new twist on the story with the lead character
Dec 2 2023,positive,for context ive been a pretty dedicated fan since my childhood therefore my opinion may be biased that being said fuckin a   i was skeptical but color me impressed  i felt like it was a nice and subtle throwback to the original unlike most other godzilla movies it accomplished something different this film established the subplot involving the humans in a way that was engaging understandable and made you actually care it also involved some plot twists that i did not anticipate i will gladly go and watch it again however i would prefer to see it with others who have not seen it so as to see their reactions 
Dec 2 2023,positive,watched all sorts of godzilla movies since i was a kid back in the 1970s this is the best that ive seen thus far highly recommend the sub version
Dec 2 2023,positive,its the best godzilla movie ive seen its has a great human story i must admit that i had a polaroid  moment and teared up
Dec 2 2023,positive,i never write a review but this movie was the best movie with special effects since lord of the rings  the storyline is phenomenal and godzilla looked incredible  i recommend you see this on the big screen
Dec 2 2023,positive,not your traditional kaiju movie this is a drama that is in a kaiju universe great acting and a great script this will receive numerous film awards must watch
Dec 2 2023,positive,a cool and new outlook on the iconic king of the monsters special effects were wayy better then multi million dollar hollywood flicks and this movie payed homage to the original also kept to its roots the way it should be godzilla is a definite must see for all generations of godzilla fans
Dec 2 2023,positive,thank you toho for making godzilla right again keep it coming
Dec 2 2023,positive,lifetime godzilla fan here as ive grown older i still love the franchise as a whole but unfortunately as soon as toho realized you could make money putting the focus on the giant monster versus battles compared to the human drama it just hasnt been the same however this movie manages to give us a compelling and wellwritten and wellacted story with some of the best monster action to the date gojira has been my favorite for a while gmk a close second but minus one is for several reasons my favorite and im excited to take the whole family to see it tomorrow
Dec 2 2023,positive,for me this film was the best of the best godzilla films ever made i rank it with the original godzilla 1954 for being the best i thought the actingstorytelling and the music was spot on as a full grown old man i cried because of the characters were so intense in their roles hats off to toho and the japanese people in making a grand masterpiece 100
Dec 2 2023,positive,this is the first godzilla film from toho since 2016 and it was honestly worth the wait it hits you with every emotion especially sorrow and i cared for the characters so much i didnt want them to die you feel for them throughout the film and want to cry with them the incredible score adds to it godzilla surprisingly feels more scarier than shin godzilla which i thought was a high bar to reach but obviously i need to reevaluate my bars the director is obviously a steven spielberg fan as well because godzilla felt like jaws he was a force of nature unlike most godzilla films godzilla minus one is worth seeing on the biggest screen you can and i highly recommend you see this spectacle while its in theaters
Dec 2 2023,positive,excellent story the acting was phenomenal best godzilla ever
Dec 2 2023,positive,it held true to the old godzilla movies while still being a thrilling and absolutely terrifying experience you could see the passion from all of the cast and they performed so well
Dec 2 2023,positive,not only the best godzilla movie but one of if not the best movie in recent memory fantastic on every level
Dec 2 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is so much more than at first glance godzilla minus one is a modern cinematic masterpiece that harkens back to the original godzilla the acting is top notch and the setting of post ww2 japan is very somber the overall theme of the story is one of survivors guilt the visuals of the movies are amazing considering the budget of the film is a fraction of a hollywood film it may sound crazy but godzilla minus one should be considered for best motion picture or director at the oscars
Dec 2 2023,positive,awesome movie really true to the way godzilla is portrayed spectacular cast aswell effects were amazing overall a 1010 experience for me
Dec 2 2023,positive,minus one is the best godzilla movie of them all so far  i was surprised by the depth of the storytelling and the poignant struggles of the main character  metaphors abound
Dec 2 2023,positive,its simple  best godzilla movie ever made its budget 15 million dollars with its quality both production and acting wise puts to shame all hollywood blockbusters go and see it  you will be very pleased also by a surprisingly good and engaging human story
Dec 2 2023,positive,i thought godzilla had peaked once more with the amazing shin godzilla and would be untouchable for years to come but i was so wrong and happily so godzilla minus one is the best godzilla movie imo and easily one of the best movies of this year it does something the western godzilla movies fail to do and that is have a captivating compelling human element amongst all the destruction youd do a disservice to yourself not to check out this movie in theaters
Dec 2 2023,positive,the best godzilla movie ive ever seen perfectly blends monster action and human drama
Dec 2 2023,positive,really good movie  a little to much talking but godzilla was right on the money
Dec 2 2023,positive,i liked the whole movie well done to the cast and crew one of my favorite godzilla movies
Dec 2 2023,positive,godzilla 1 was amazing s tier on this one if godzilla wasnt in it it still would have been a compelling story the humans in this one matter and have real depth i was shocked by the number of tears i shed during a friggin godzilla movie lots of powerful stuff going on in this one i want to sit with it and see it again but this might be the greatest godzilla movie of them all i know its bold statement but wow if youre any sort of godzilla fan you owe it to yourself to see this on the biggest screen with the best sound system you can find best movie of 2023 for me i found nothing to nitpick i cant really give any higher praise than that everything works the actors are all top notch the cg was perfect the score amazing just wow
Dec 2 2023,positive,a great monster movie with a very strong and surprisingly emotional human story feelings of terror hopelessness sadness joy and triumph made this a very welcome part of the godzilla franchise an absolute must see
Dec 2 2023,positive,loved it the human characters were interesting and had lots of emotion godzilla was properly scary the movie played out like a war film and mirrored the effects of hiroshima just like the original godzilla film  the bits in the wooden boat were awesome  felt like jaws with godzilla so cool and gs heat ray was awesome in this incarnation
Dec 2 2023,positive,great movie for us godzilla fans this will be the go to movie for convincing your girlfriend that youre not a nerd for loving godzilla from now on also good story
Dec 2 2023,positive,thrilling emotional and a exceptional addition to the godzilla franchise
Dec 2 2023,positive,a must see movie i loved it
Dec 2 2023,positive,go watch this movie now
Dec 2 2023,positive,amazing character development and innovative approach to a godzilla movie highly recommend and suggest watching the movie in 4dx
Dec 2 2023,positive,lookim a 58 year old american man that loves godzilla moviesthis is by far the best i have seengreat storygreat fxit truly beat out all the big budget american movies someone else mentioned it has a jaws kinda feel and i agree its in sub titles and still rose above all the others made me tear up at the endand i can count on one hand when ive ever done thatbravo japanese cinema bravo 
Dec 2 2023,positive,this is hands down the best godzilla movie yet if youve only watcher the american godzilla movies please please watch this the characters are written so well and throughout the movie you grow with them experience trauma with them watch them break down and try to overcome it it is seriously gripping especially towards the end of the movie with great twists and acting the action is also great and the way that godzilla is seriously destroying everything in this movie and really being seen as a monster is very well done this in general has to be one of the best movies released this year so please go watch it and give it the credit it deserves incredible ode to the original godzilla they created while also making it modern but still mixing it with old touches japan really knows what theyre doing when it comes to movies like this
Dec 2 2023,positive,phenomenal story telling action character development and emotion this movie had me feeling
Dec 2 2023,positive,seriously good not just one of the best godzilla movies but up there with the best movie of 2023
Dec 2 2023,positive,great godzilla movie they need to dub english or a lot of people wont see it and deserves a bigger audience
Dec 2 2023,positive,was the best godzilla movie to date i didnt think shin godzilla could be dethroned  but it was
Dec 2 2023,positive,wow truly the best godzilla film
Dec 2 2023,positive,well done checks all the boxes you expect in a good godzilla film
Dec 1 2023,positive,this is the best godzilla movie ive ever seen 1010 must watch
Dec 1 2023,positive,takashi yamazaki should be proud he has set the new gold standard by which ever monster movie going forward should be held to
Dec 1 2023,positive,as a person who has watched godzilla movies for 45 years i can tell you the king of the monsters never looked so awsome the story was well done and emotional just like the first in 1954
Dec 1 2023,positive,honestly breathtaking pretty much everything you want in a godzilla film 
Dec 1 2023,positive,an excellent godzilla movie they take it back to the roots and honestly this might be the best godzilla movie ive ever seen
Dec 1 2023,positive,im a lifelong godzilla fan okay obsessive but believe me when i say that this may be the best in the series since the 1954 debut and a film that can and should be appreciated by anyone everything works in this original inventive film  the visuals and creature design the believable story given the irradiated monster in the middle of it and the human drama that is so often the boring bits between atomic destruction  even if you have franchise fatigue book your tickets for this one  well be talking about it for years
Dec 1 2023,positive,absolutely spectacular best godzilla to date an absolute must see
Dec 1 2023,positive,phenomenal movie godzilla is insane and the humans in the movie are fantastic
Dec 1 2023,positive,when godzilla arrived at tokyo for the first time and his main theme started playing everyone in my theater lost their minds it was so nostalgic hearing godzillas main suite playing whilst he was destroying tokyo godzillas atomic breath scene was also one of the coolest things ive ever seen in a movie his atomic breath is literally like a nuke exploding one of my favorite parts of the movie was when godzilla got half his head blown off and he instantly regenerated it another cool part of this movie is when godzilla dies and it cuts to a shot of a piece of godzilla flesh regenerating teasing a potential sequel i forgot to mention how awesome these human characters are i actually cared for these characters and i was worried for them throughout the movie  unlike past godzilla films  also can i mention how awesome the human story is this is possibly the best human story ive ever seen in a godzilla film the plot to kill godzilla was so creative in my opinion sinking godzilla to the bottom of the ocean so the sea pressure would crush him and then when they bring godzilla back to the surface to finish the job it was so dang awesome one of my favorite things about this film was the fact it had so many references to the old godzilla movies i noticed at least a few dozen references i found out after i watched this movie that this films budget was 15 million dollars for reference godzilla vs kongs budget was 155200 million dollars getting to see godzilla be the bad guy again was a nice breath of fresh air i simply cannot put into words how much i enjoyed watching this film arguably the best godzilla film ever made
Dec 1 2023,positive,if you are a die hard godzilla fan if youve not seen this what the hell is wrong with you this movie in my eyes is a prequel to the original gojira and is worth 10 million stars out of 5  seeing godzilla regenerate on the big screen where he regenerated part of his face holy cow and his heart was slowly regenerating in the water
Dec 1 2023,positive,not just a great godzilla movie its a great movie period great story about war and the cost of war friendship and family the last line of the movie hit pretty hard especially if you or a loved one has served in the military plus it has godzilla highly recommended
Dec 1 2023,positive,i recently watched the original 1954 godzilla movie and found it a great balance of monster movie and emotional drama id suggest that the time and the movie culture of japan in that time made the latter aspect a difficult challenge but they did manage it subsequent godzilla movies that ive seen have not provided this for me but i fully acknowledge this isnt a franchise ive devoted myself to so there are likely many that achieve this    so that said i struggle to remember a movie that i was more impressed with or enjoyed more it was astonishingly good with personal grief and emotion seriously frightening scenes of devastations and actual im not crying youre crying moments in a godzilla movie i really felt this wasnt a movie of monster devastation but boy howdy was there monster and devastation but a movie about people and how the heck would they deal with this catastrophe just shortly after the war that theyd barely survived    youll hear a lot about this film go see it so you can be the one who saw it first okay this might be a little marketing        ive tried to avoid saying its the best movie ive seen in years but others are saying similar things     like forbes magazine for example the latest reboot godzilla minus one is one of 2023s greatest films and the result is that godzilla minus one is the best godzilla film ever made and a masterpiece of kaiju cinema
Dec 1 2023,positive,wow he was angry and just wow toho nailed it this time
Dec 1 2023,positive,that scene where they put the bombs around godzilla and theme playing my lord it the best movie this year by a land slide
Dec 1 2023,positive,phenomenal movie that really nails godzilla it perfectly portrays the scenes with the titular creature as terrifying and conveys the despair the story is really good and you care for the characters worrying about what might happen to them as they encounter godzilla its a great movie
Dec 1 2023,positive,didnt think id say this about a godzilla movie but i really cared about the humans well crafted characters that actually had you emotionally invested in them and their relationships not only to each other but also to the star of the show himself godzilla this is also the best looking and most realistic godzilla ever and i remember thinking multiple times wow they really put a lot of money into this movie then i found out the budget was only 15 million that made the movie even more impressive than it already was dont see this movie at home as your first experiencesee it in the theatre its not only a love letter to godzilla fans but a great film for all movie fans in general not doubt godzilla minus one is in the top 3 godzilla films of alltime if not the greatest 55
Dec 1 2023,positive,this is how a godzilla movie should be done i love this movie so much
Dec 1 2023,positive,this film is an absolute triumph the human protagonists elevate rather than reduce the quality of the story a quality that is missing in many godzilla films the story is thematically dense thought provoking tragic and yet uplifting whether you are a longtime fan or have never watched a godzilla film this movie will blow you away
Dec 1 2023,positive,i  loved the story line  and the pace of the movie definitely top two movies of toho  i am seeing again tomorrow 
Dec 1 2023,positive,this was a great version of godzilla  its not just some monster movie  it has a good plot and heartbreaking personal stories behind it it spins a story that older people will absolutely relate too and the scifivisuals are top notch   if you are into all that cookie cutter comic book movies or think the masked singer is great forget this movie
Dec 1 2023,positive,to be honest i have only ever seen the american godzilla films which is why i was really excited when i heard this japanese production was getting a wide release and as someone new to this franchise minus one floored me  the acting is fantastic the characters are endearing the cinematography is gorgeous the music is awesome the effects are fantastic and godzilla is terrifying  i have but one spoilerfilled flaw with this film and thats it  this is a staggeringly fantastic blockbuster it delivered so much of everything that i wanted as a newcomer to this franchise that i can only imagine how ecstatic longtime godzilla fans will be watching this film
Dec 1 2023,positive,absolutely fantastic
Dec 1 2023,positive,geez thats a good a movie
Dec 1 2023,positive,i didnt know what to expect going into this movie but i was thoroughly entertained amazed and enthralled my partner and i both cried several times and hung onto every moment    10010 best movie ive seen all year possibly ever quite possibly one of the most perfect movies    epic emotional and enthralling
Dec 1 2023,positive,oh when the big guy shows up and the theme starts playing slowly and builds
Dec 1 2023,positive,this isnt your typical monster movie but a monster movie with actual story progression that will leave you feeling bittersweet
Dec 1 2023,positive,it was truly a masterpiece toho did it again and all thanks to the director takashi yamazaki he made godzilla scary again
Dec 1 2023,positive,i have never seen another godzilla movie before this but you dont have to this movie is a stand alone godzilla film that is perfect the human story had me emotionally invested to where i was not bored when godzilla was not on screen when godzilla was on screen i feared that he would kill our main characters the acting from the cast is some of the best ive seen i would recommend seeing this movie no matter who you are
Dec 1 2023,positive,the acting was top notch generally i dont like to watch movies where i have to read the captions but in this movie it didnt interfere at all with either watching the movie or reading the captions the story is very dramatic  the godzilla monster is absolutely vicious when it comes to killing and destroying  the special effects with the godzilla renders were excellent sometimes off when it came to navy ships  the movie was not fast paced but it did move along and didnt leave me bored at any point  i enjoyed the story and the movie as a whole  this movie proves you dont have to go all 200 million dollars to create a great movie with top tier special effects  if you like  great drama great acting and a great monster movie this is the one
Dec 1 2023,positive,i love this movie a must go to for any fan of godzilla the character growth acting and vfx was really good and godzilla was the best acting character in this movie the feels it provided just brilliant will be going again to see it
Dec 1 2023,positive,the movie had a compelling story never stopped being entertaining and worth the price of admission
Dec 1 2023,positive,i cant wait to see what they do next
Dec 1 2023,positive,it is a very important film in addition to being one of the best godzilla films i have ever seen and the radical change between the current godzilla and the legendary one is striking but the sound is rarely very abrupt but the rest is extremely great
Dec 1 2023,positive,you have to go see it on the big screen
Dec 1 2023,positive,this is the best godzilla movie ever brings him back to his days of destroying everything in his path will definitely see this multiple times
Dec 1 2023,positive,undoubtedly one of if not the best monster movie there is
Dec 1 2023,positive,way better than shin godzilla in the prior godzilla films they failed to highlight the human story in a way that was emotionally relatable this story did the human side justice  from surviving wwii to encountering godzilla the main protagonist goes through hell i know some godzilla fans may be disappointed that there is less godzilla but this is almost a survival film and redemption if youre into story i highly recommend this one my second favorite godzilla film after vs destroyah
Dec 1 2023,positive,great movie had some classic godzilla easter eggs from the original black and white film the human characters side story was also really good and could honestly make for a good short stand alone post ww2 film without godzilla american studios could really take a lesson on well written characters within a giant monster film
Dec 1 2023,positive,i have no words and nothing but words  it was phenomenal
Dec 1 2023,positive,over the past 7 decades the toho godzilla series has offered everything from somber horror to camp to thrills to almost arcadelike action  and ive enjoyed pretty much them all this one takes us back to the beginning and i swear godzilla has never been more terrifying or the human elements of the film more engrossing this film will take hold of you emotionally more than any previous installment and more than the vast majority of cinema has ever managed it is a bit slow to set up but it pays off if subtitles bother you im not sure a dubbed version is showing  but i also doubt a dub could do some of these performances justice    what a film
Dec 1 2023,positive,the best godzilla in last years absolutely perfect
Dec 1 2023,positive,best godzilla movie ever period couldve used one more godzilla mayhem scene and i would change only one thing with the ending but otherwise a great movie nonetheless do not miss this it isnt some goofy corny godzilla movie its a character driven drama with great godzilla scenes
Dec 1 2023,positive,i just returned from the cinema i am enchanted great movie very well written characters engaging storyline probably the best movie ive seen in the cinema this year
Dec 1 2023,positive,amazingly wellmade movie especially when you consider the relatively small budget both grand in scale and focused on the human side of things as well it was emotional and gripping throughout and the pacing was great best movie i have seen this year as it was a total package of why we go to the movies
Dec 1 2023,positive,this film is a masterpiece well done toho
Dec 1 2023,negative,this movie is soooooo bad the plot leads to no where of i wanted to waste time i would eat garbage 
Dec 1 2023,positive,an excellent film one i f the best godzilla films go see it
Dec 1 2023,negative,im honestly surprised by all the glowing reviews i was really excited to see this movie after watching the trailer but it was a huge letdown ill admit the opening was one of the best godzilla segments ive ever seen and japans godzilla is way more terrifying than hollywoods but aside from the intense and terrifying godzilla scenes of which there were few the film suffered from pacing issues and unlikeable characters during one of its many slow sequences the man next to me literally yelled just move on already id suggest just skipping to the godzilla scenes when it comes out
Dec 1 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is most likely my favorite movie of the year the strength of its storytelling and special effects are immense but on a scale far more grand than the modest budget might have you think the film is an interesting alternate take on the story of the original 1954 film with many characters and scenes in homage to the classic while also delivering amazing new ways the giant monster has not been perceived before and with a ferocity that can actually generate fear highest recommendation to any moviegoing fan not just the genre junkies like me
Dec 1 2023,positive,best godzilla movie ever you have to go watch it 
Dec 1 2023,positive,they show as the real godzilla they are work on it that is awesome
Dec 1 2023,positive,excellent movie turning existential atomic dread into a more personal case of ptsd and survivors guilt resulting in an amazing story
Dec 1 2023,positive,tohos latest raises the bar for godzilla movies and kaiju cinema
Dec 1 2023,positive,the emphasis on the destruction he can cause was great
Dec 1 2023,positive,an amazing story along with cgi one of the best
Dec 1 2023,positive,a movie that goes back to the series roots while taking a new perspective to the approach lively characters that are entertaining through the humor and the drama and a ferocious relentless take on the japanese beast haunting scores to go along with his appearances accompanied by fantastic acting this film will remind you how haunting this time for japan was
Dec 1 2023,positive,the best godzilla film since the 50s
Dec 1 2023,positive,best monster movie ive ever seen  the human story would have been good as a standalone story and fits in with godzilla so well  you can tell they paid homage to the 1954 origin too
Dec 1 2023,positive,something rare that godzilla movies do is make you care and be interested in the human characters the emotional feeling from the original 1954 film is recaptured here you get attached to the main characters so much that it makes you wish that nothing happens to them godzilla is scary and his performance in the film probably out beats the rest this is not the hero that restores balance or just an animal this is monster godzilla the writing is spectacular and the film itself just looks amazing brilliant film i would be disappointed if this film is not at least a nominee for the academy awards
Dec 1 2023,positive,awesome movie to be experienced on the big screen being read with native language was a pleasure and felt authentic

Dec 1 2023,positive,i just watched the film last night and i rushed to see it again on imax tonight     this film is incredible this was the first time i actually felt scared of godzilla the characters are also incredible and was also the first time i cared if the characters safety i wanted them to survive the entire film except for koichi koichi whined way too much for me i wanted to slap him and tell him to collect himself other than that my partner and i loved the film this is the best godzilla ive seen so far thoroughly loved the amazing story telling i cannot wait to watch it over and over again on screen fingers crossed it gets more imax time 
Dec 1 2023,positive,such a sigma movie all my sigmas should watch it
Dec 1 2023,positive,i thought it was fantastic all of godzilla fans want more screen time for the big guy so thats a given the movie was very entertaining and fx was done well my only kind of negative thoughts is that i wanted more stomping through tokyolol go enjoy it fan or not
Dec 1 2023,positive,this may be the best movie of 2023  highly highly recommend
Dec 1 2023,positive,this movie is not only for kaiju fans but for anyone who is looking for a good emotional action packed entertainment not only is the story well told but the visual effects have you questioning what is hollywood doing these days because this movie is very low budget a huge step up from shingodzilla2016 this movie is the most important movie to have come out of japan cinema in a very long time
Dec 1 2023,positive,this movie is a masterpiece it is one of the rare movies where i felt a true emotional connection to the human characters often in a godzilla film you want more godzilla and less of the plot humans but this movie hit the perfect balance this is a movie about family about the value of life and returns godzilla back to its serious origins the effects are also a spectacle never have i seen such a clear view at godzilla and have him move in such an organic way a monstrous godzilla paired with a somber and beautiful plot there has never been a better godzilla film in theater
Dec 1 2023,positive,the film blew me away best godzilla movie since the 1954 original sound design was amazing people are going to be talking about this film for a long time
Dec 1 2023,positive,extremely entertaining once the actions starts the music is iconic this new godzilla is awesome
Dec 1 2023,positive,this is probably the most dramatic and emotionally filled godzilla movie that keeps you engaged from start to finish with great scenes of destruction with the big g
Dec 1 2023,positive,godzilla minus one may be one of if not the best film in the entire godzilla franchise    our main protagonists in the film are engaging and show us the struggles of post war japan we feel their sorrow and pain as well as their faith as they push for a better future    as for the big g himself wow every time he is on screen you are on the edge of your seat his presence is horrifying and majestic at the same time he is a walking atomic bomb and it shows    1110
Dec 1 2023,positive,such a great movie smart mature thoughtful made by competent people with a really great artistic vision
Dec 1 2023,positive,the godzilla films have long suffered from lackluster writing for the human characters dont get me wrong i have seen every godzilla movie and have been a fan since i was a kid but its always been about watching monsters destroying cities godzilla minus one feels like a complete movie package great characters great acting a smart plot and a godzilla that is actually scary go see this one in the theater
Dec 1 2023,positive,as a long time godzilla fan i went into this film with high expectations and toho certainly didnt disappoint not only does this film hold an empathetic and engaging human cast but it also tells a tonal and dramatic story of guilt a soldiers duty and the aftermath of war personally i wouldve enjoyed this as a standalone film but the biggest cherry on top is how godzilla was seamlessly weaved into the story godzilla actually played a large roll in the main characters motivations and development rather than the typical random obstacle to overcome godzilla himself harkens back to the original 1954 version a terrifying monster a force of nature with no rhyme or reason disturbed by humanitys meddling godzilla in this film is terrifying even more so than 2016s shin godzilla overall i only had minor critiques throughout the film and despite personally finding the ending a bit disappointing i think the rest of the film makes up for it completely this film is not only an example of how to make an amazing monster movie but also just an amazing movie in general 1010
Dec 1 2023,positive,this movie was absolutely amazing it had an amazing story line and the characters in the movie were not useless to the story line also the movie did a great job in making the viewers actually care about the humans and what happens to them they did a great job with the cgi making godzilla look real over all this movie was a 910 definitely a must watch
Dec 1 2023,positive,one of the best godzilla films ever created and should be seen by everyone
Dec 1 2023,positive,one of the best films of the year
Dec 1 2023,positive,one of the greatest pieces of cinema ever out to screen a sobering retelling of the original 1954 film godzilla minus one 2023 displays the crippling tragedy of war through the metaphor of the monster who has and always will do it best the film is a true emblem of the broken postwar japan the feelings of disgrace and overwhelming trauma of the war are expertly woven into the characters and their narrative providing a gripping human element that gives to heart and weight to the film a culmination of a nearly 70 year legacy godzilla minus one 2023 is perhaps the best and most raw godzilla has ever been
Dec 1 2023,positive,godzilla minus one was a very emotional piece with easily the best human story in the franchise and quite a classic movie feel i know this will definitely be one of my favorite films of all time for the rest of my life
Dec 1 2023,positive,terrifying deeply moving and thoughtprovoking see it on the largest screen you can
Dec 1 2023,positive,absolutely masterpiece godzilla was terrifying and looked amazing ive never been so invested in the human story of a godzilla movie before
Dec 1 2023,positive,taking what makes godzilla great and taking it back to basics
Dec 1 2023,negative,monster disappointment  the writerdirector takashi yamazaki talked this up as a film that would capture the horror terror and despair that godzilla would create if real  the teasers and trailers all mirrored that description but the actual movie is 10 godzilla and 90 human melodrama  i am one of those godzilla fans  the ones who go to a godzilla movie to see godzilla not the human characters  i never felt any connection to any of the characters and found myself looking at my watch during the last 40 minutes of the film  i understand a lot of godzilla fans love this movie but i was not one of them
Dec 1 2023,positive,best godzilla movie ive ever seen its amazing to see what this team did with a 15 million dollar budget great storyline and even better visual effects its a must watch on the big screen i prefer the original japanese with english subtitles viewing if you can make it
Dec 1 2023,positive,awesome movie best version of godzilla so far cant wait for what next
Dec 1 2023,positive,incredible a fresh real human look at a genre we think we know godzilla has become enshrined mythos in japanese culture and here it is examined through the eyes of authentic characters played by a superb cast for truly the first time despite the phenomenal special effects we have seen him in the recent monsterverse films the creature is terrifyingly real the cast and plot aided by top notch direction has given us dare i say it an oscar worthy tale for the ages 
Dec 1 2023,positive,this was an amazing movie start to finish the human element of dealing with ptsd and how terrifying godzilla is this is what a monster movie should be a scary godzilla very well paced and balanced between godzilla and the human element
Dec 1 2023,positive,a lot of heartfelt moments and suspense to match all in all a real good movie
Dec 1 2023,positive,as far as godzilla movies go minus one is among the best of the best taking us back to a traumatic period in japanese history it reflects on japans place in the war and how godzilla itself is now a representation of trauma it has great characters great music great action and utilises its budget well great film
Dec 1 2023,positive,the best godzilla movie yet
Dec 1 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is one of if not the best godzilla movie out there right now the pacing is perfect the story is phenomenal when godzilla shows up it is extremely tense and youre on the edge of your seat rooting for the characters the visual effects and design of godzilla is some of the best ive ever seen and its not just godzilla whos awesome every character is well thought out and has their time to shine it is a perfect balance of human and godzilla and they even benefit each other which isnt as common as it should be i also want to say the sound design was extraordinary when godzilla is on screen you dont just see him you hear him too definitely a movie to see in the best screentheater possible i also want to mention the music was also amazing  it was so cool to hear a ton of classic godzilla music and the new music made for this film is possibly better than the classic music i walked into godzilla minus one expecting an amazing movie but it was an experience i walked out of and one i want to relive over and over again
Dec 1 2023,positive,must watch in 4dx theater story is compelling and the action is amazing heat ray steals the show
Dec 1 2023,positive,spectacular best version of godzilla movie i have ever seen this was beautifully written and i will definitely be watching it again
Dec 1 2023,positive,by far best godzilla movie in terms of story and fx  if there was anything bad it would be not enough monster but then you run risk of boring movie so they really focused on character development so much that it feels like a post war drama with godzilla as a backdrop  what was interesting was the plan to kill the monster which was very creative and just something you never see the humans do in such a film which is fight head on with the monster
Dec 1 2023,positive,loved it returned to a classic format and godzilla looked amazing
Dec 1 2023,negative,sorry this film had too many lapses in logic and was marred by poor stilted onenote acting to be effective i mean the best performance was by the young girl thats kind of sad you know   the premise is good but whats on screen just progresses from one scene to the next like everyone is going through the motions maybe the only scene with any urgency takes place on the boat when the crew of four first encounters godzilla   and seeing how the us base in ginza must surely have been destroyed its incredulous to believe the us wouldnt get involved if the director had wanted to get away with a pure fantasy film hed have done better to set it 200 years in the past wwii memories are still very much alive and rewriting history like this is risky business
Dec 1 2023,positive,yamazakis minus one is an essay on maximizing a modest budget by employing excellent character development that grounds this godzilla outing to a degree that audiences havent seen since the 1954 original  its a visceral tour de force with all the money on screen  an engaging often poignant dramatic piece about community ptsd and survivors guilt along with self redemption  the godzilla set pieces are utterly riveting but its the uniformly superb ensemble cast that will cement minus one as one of the best films of 2023 and its standing within the kaiju pantheon
Dec 1 2023,positive,an intelligent emotional story about post war trauma and survival that just happens to have a radioactive monster arrive to add to the wartime devastation   this is a movie that proves that you can blend realistic characters dealing with authentic problems with fantastical elements and make a compelling story  in japanese with subtitles as it should be  the characters and situations are so well developed you could watch it without translation and still understand the film   kudos also for the attention to detail regarding the use of wwii japanese military equipment and warships that are relevant to the story   and godzilla  he never looked better  true to the original 1954 version but with details not possible using traditional effects    this is one enraged and destructive creature   this is  a godzilla movie that makes you forget the underwhelming monsterverse offerings  go see it
Dec 1 2023,positive,masterpiece it earns that 98 rt score and so much more no thanks to adam does movies the only negative critic review i urge anyone to see this movie you will come out more than satisfied
Dec 1 2023,positive,this godzilla is the best it finally makes godzilla scary again in no way is he saving earth hes the enemy now he is so much more powerful loved the movie
Dec 1 2023,positive,this is my personal favorite gojira movie ever made its definitely worth seeing in a theater  go support this movie if you are a fan
Dec 1 2023,positive,this film was a rollercoaster from the start godzilla was a malevolent force that almost took on a terminator esque persona the graphics most of the time were amazing and believable but at times seemed poorly paced and unrealistic    as a faithful reimagening and retelling of the original godzilla film its provides a unique look at how people deal with trauma and how to move on     it is a must see for any kaiju lover and doubly so for a godzilla fan
Dec 1 2023,positive,great mix of monster and human story great action scenes over all godzilla is and still king of the monsters
Dec 1 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is one of the best godzilla films to come out since godzilla 1954 having characters you want to root for a monster of war and the evils of nuclear power and a rich story that doesnt get confusing a muddled like more recent american godzilla films  the soundtrack having a dreadful feeling to it including parts of the 1954 soundtrack that made me shake in my seat  godzilla is a true villain but you can tell he is still just a mutated creature having him only become physically dangerous with his heat ray when attacked  this is the perfect prequel film and i would gladly watch it again
Dec 1 2023,positive,if you like godzilla movies you will love it if you like a good story on loss and redemption you will love it as well
Dec 1 2023,positive,i loved the movie so much best kaiju movie
Dec 1 2023,positive,i went in theaters to watch this film and  this blew away my expectations best godzilla film of all time right next to godzilla 2014 king of the monsters and the original  1954 film    i seriously recommend this timeless masterpiece to all those about to go out there to the movie theaters like seriously they made the godzilla and the human screentime perfectly balanced and fixed the goji screentime problem filled with emotions horror dark tones and relations    im not kidding this is the best movie of alltime now to me at least but still i recommend this movie it was spectacular i promise you
Dec 1 2023,positive,see it in imax of you can
Dec 1 2023,positive,the best godzilla movie ever made  outstanding acting and story   godzilla was really pissed off during the movie   a surprise ending    a must see
Dec 1 2023,positive,beautiful directing powerful film great acting all around godzilla is scary again
Dec 1 2023,positive,this is a movie first and a godzilla movie second yet it does not neglect the giant monsters     godzilla is very present and very destructive     this movie is more like shin godzilla than godzilla final wars its a beautiful piece of cinema that often leaves you astounded at what is presented     run to see this movie in theaters the sound design is so amazing it deserves an award the movie simply sounds better in a theater then it could possibly sound on any smaller screen
Dec 1 2023,positive,everything was good movie of the year it was great really heartfelt for my bic boi  godzilla
Dec 1 2023,positive,while not as intellectually stimulating as shin godzilla godzilla minus one succeeds in almost every area making it a must see for any fan of monster movies or war dramas
Dec 1 2023,positive,this isnt just one of the best godzilla movies ever its one of the best movies ever period
Dec 1 2023,positive,the first monster movie in a long time where i gave a crap about the humans i wasnt just waiting for godzilla to appear but when he did  what a payoff run dont walk run like godzilla was chasing you
Dec 1 2023,positive,im old enough to remember the first godzilla movie by toho first there was the english language version with raymond burr which was shown for years on tv when i was a kid it was an amalgamation for the original japanese language film which was finally available years later far superior this latest from toho may be the best yet great character development and story set after wwii and the aftermath of the japanese defeat the way the writers tied all the characters together was amazing you really cared about them of course the monster and the effects are simply breathtaking i came away feeling like i just saw one of the best films of the year a must see even if you never saw the original brilliant 
Dec 1 2023,positive,loved this movie  probably my favorite godzilla movie and one of my favorites of 2023
Dec 1 2023,positive,loved it godzilla is enraged and relentless the story telling and human connection is superb the score is so much fun great acting and fantastic work was thoroughly surprised to find out later it only had a 15m budget stunning a
Dec 1 2023,positive,it is the best movie with the iconic japanese monster godzilla a moral  antinuclear and the very destruction of human beings i love the fact that godzilla in this movie really feels the suspense
Dec 1 2023,positive,great movie not so much hollywood involved just a great origin story
Dec 1 2023,positive,this movie does what previous godzilla movies have failed to do and that is human characters that youll actually want to root for and care about as for godzilla himself he is done incredibly well they have brought him back to his original roots like he was in 54 this movie is truly a top contender for the best godzilla movie
Dec 1 2023,positive,best godzilla movie of all time puts the western adaptations to shame and does it with less than half the budget
Dec 1 2023,positive,the whole movie kept you attentive both with waiting what godzilla did in a scene and the story with the characters the atomic breath scene towards the end was probably at the same height as the oppenheimer bomb scene
Dec 1 2023,positive,minus one is the best movie of the year    just got back from an early access fan event it was absolutely fantastic the story human characters destruction and visual effects are the best the series has ever had his atomic blast is literally atomic not just a great godzilla move but a great movie period the best ive seen this year see it in whichever theatre near you with the best sound system the dolby cinema sound was mind blowing godzillas roar never sounded better
Dec 1 2023,positive,i cannot apologize for my review 55 is ridiculous are there flaws absolutelybut they are minor for a 15 million dollar film i now know that hollywood is broken cgi is like the graphics debate of video games good stories resonate over fancy visuals    am i a lifelong godzilla fan yes i love 1954 8485 destoroyah and shin but this is by far the best balance of human drama while respecting godzillas original themes honda and tanaka would be proud i am glad japan has reclaimed its creation the reiwa era has followed up with a nice ko punch
Dec 1 2023,positive,great movie dont expect to see godzilla in every scene this movie builds great characters and when you do get godzilla it makes it more worth watching
Dec 1 2023,positive,i phenomenal movie one of the best i seen this year godzilla is at his most terrifying we have seen him the human plot is actually worth watching for once a must see
Dec 1 2023,positive,a brutal and violent new take on godzilla that gives new life to the original storyline acting is great story is sad but with several relief characters that give you hope and godzilla is a frickin sea monster in a way we havent seen before ive watched it twice and its amazing
Dec 1 2023,positive,i applaud this movie for having characters we actually enjoy everything about this movie is perfect as a godzilla movie and very well crafted as a legitimate movie its better than basically every godzilla movie and i thought shin godzilla was as good as it was gonna get for a newer godzilla film part of the top 3 best godzilla films that almost anyone can likelove fan or not just be warned that this movie is just as dark as the original in some aspects to the point where you could get tearyeyed watching it
Dec 1 2023,positive,this movie was incredible compelling human drama outstanding music and absolutely terrifying the scariest godzilla has ever been must see on the biggest screen possible had me tearing up and rooting so much for the humans
Dec 1 2023,positive,best godzilla movie ive seen personally usually the human characters seem bland and are just there to fill time this movie i actually felt emotional connection towards most of the main cast 1010
Dec 1 2023,positive,ive been a godzilla aficionado since childhood this is the best godzilla movie ive ever watched magnificent and happy to go see it again
Dec 1 2023,positive,i went to an early showing of the film on november 29th it was a lastminute decision spurred by my love of kaiju films and a desire to see new movies i invited a few friends and when leaving the theatre we were speechless with only one thing to say we need to watch this again i was blown out of the water by the superb acting and the amazing visuals i am not an emotional person especially with films but i teared up and cried at 2 distinct points in the movie when watching most monster films you wish for the razing of cities and the visual of the destruction and loss of life here is quite the opposite believable human characters that you immediately fall in love with i see this movie as one that is a mustsee and at that a mustsee on the big screen fans of kaiju films jaws and jurassic park will surely enjoy 1010 no complaints
Dec 1 2023,positive,one of the 3 best g movies ever  completely stand alone g movie with amazing effects and a heartfelt story absolutely loved it the 54 original shin g and now minus one are the the standouts in his long running franchise the american monsterverse movies just cant compete with any of tohos japanese movies they lack the charm and feel in every way imaginable saw this one in 4dx so it wasa all that much more fun  thank you toho and please dont stop your truly original entries fan for life
Dec 1 2023,positive,this movie does what it set out to do perfectly and is a must watch for practically anyone whos even slightly interested    despite my soft spot for the american films theyre sloppily written and are sometimes overbearing and cartoonish with just how much they show the monsters doing cool things  minus one has significantly less godzilla than the american films and yet has a 100 better use of the monster for what it wants to do godzilla is on screen for the perfect amount of time and is used in a near perfect way  all of the rest of the screentime is used by extremely well written human characters well developed themes and proper execution of the plot    overall this is easily my favorite movie of the godzilla franchise and deserves all the praise that its getting absolute must watch
Dec 1 2023,positive,this movie did amazing making godzilla a destroyer a monster to the human race his design along with the amazing cgi did him justice im also amazed that the movie made the human characters so loveable and when the movie progresses you really see how they conquer there issues and trauma this is probably the very first movie that made me love the human characters in a monster movie and the ending makes me want to watch more so im super exited for the sequel  100 2010 movie worth the watch
Dec 1 2023,positive,great visual movie with emotional acting taking the place of  over the top special effects
Dec 1 2023,positive,i was not prepared for how amazing this movie would be
Dec 1 2023,positive,excellent movie all the way around great plot great acting i normally cant watch movies with subtitles but this was so good this is one of my favorite looks for godzilla aesthetically but as far as the destruction he causes in minus one its the absolute best in my opinion he is very violent and powerful was a great experience watching in a theater its a must see
Dec 1 2023,positive,great character development and chemistry the best liveaction godzilla that brings back the original black and white godzilla memories to the fans
Dec 1 2023,positive,ayo who let them cook

Dec 1 2023,positive,a much more moving story than i expected from a godzilla movie really enjoyable experience overall
Dec 1 2023,positive,this was a great addition to the godzilla franchise   the plot was great cinematography and special effects good also  godzilla has serious anger management issues but this was offset with a really heart warming storyline
Dec 1 2023,positive,when i mean this is a masterpiece i mean its a masterpiece not only is this one of the best godzilla movies but its a geniunely fantastic movie with a very fresh concept surprisingly deep characters excellent acting great drama pleasing visuals a fantastic score and bonechilling godzilla sequences this movie is truly incredible 1010 a
Dec 1 2023,positive,i really hope this movie gets serious consideration for academy awards it is so perfect
Dec 1 2023,positive,the raging king returns   a great 21st century japanese cultureinternational level sfx entertainment film one thing we have been waiting for to come up from the land of rising sun and they finally did it  i salute to toho and the production staff    to me the story of godzilla minus one and its cinematic perspective against of shin godzilla have a little bit in a similar relationship between flags of our fathers and letters from iwo jima   portraying one huge ragedgodlike creature and the people against but from two neartotally different characters and their standpoint s but both are still catastrophic and horrifying godzilla landfalls on japan and the japanese   they have their own pro and cons yet both they are good films and simply very scary as well as an encouraging film too by the end    viewing in a dolbycinama if not imax strongly recommended to hear his devastating roar and stamp
Dec 1 2023,positive,excellent movie the human characters are well written and the emotional beats hit hard the themes are clear and poignant and it doesnt hurt that the monster action is captivating    a must see for any movie enjoyers
Dec 1 2023,positive,incredible one of the best movies i have seen in my life so far one of the best godzilla main movies since the original    the acting is incredible the human connections the bonds the real worry and terror    the way they presented godzilla in this minus one is one of the most terrifying and genuinely scary renditions i have seen    just incredible
Dec 1 2023,positive,the greatest movie of all time
Dec 1 2023,positive,in complete shock    such a beautiful movie  story score acting cinematography sets costumesall the things    godzilla is actually rather secondary to the story and the moral of it     i actually cried    went for a campy nostalgia trip and saw one of the best movies ive seen in years goseeit godzillaminusone
Dec 1 2023,positive,the plot was excellent cgi was good i found it interesting that some of the effects had a feel of an older godzilla movie and the use of the old soundtrack made it feel really nostalgic but modern
Dec 1 2023,positive,not just the best godzilla movie ever made the best made movie of the year
Dec 1 2023,positive,this was one of the best action movies ive seen in a while ive really enjoyed the legendary monster movies but they could take a lesson from toho and takashi yamazaki on how to create characters and story that are compelling enough to carry the movie without the monster then add one heck of an awesome interpretation of godzilla and you get one of the best movies in the series the real shocker here is that toho did this on a 15 million budget disneylucasfilmmarvelare you seeing this
Dec 1 2023,positive,bringing godzilla back to its roots to well written characters and a nore intimidating godzilla hell yeah
Dec 1 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is a masterpiece in the genre this is more than just a monster movie it tells the story of a kamikaze pilot who struggles with shame ptsd and survivors guilt while trying to take care of an adopted family the story at times can beat a gut punch sprinkled with moments of levity between likable characters you learn to love and care for which makes it all the more terrifying when godzilla is on screen minus one delivers an exceptional story and returns godzilla to what the original film intended him to be a terrifying force of nature something godzilla has been lacking for quite a while
Dec 1 2023,positive,i love it i went to see this with my brother and cousin and they loved it as well the whole movie was amazing i love the action and drama i would give this movie at least 5 oscars awards i love it and i would definitely watch again
Dec 1 2023,positive,wow just wow probably the greatest godzilla movie made for the first time i was interested in the human characters while enjoying godzilla as a monster 
Dec 1 2023,positive,definitely the best visuals in a toho godzilla movie to date  its a movie that must be experienced in a theater to get the full larger than life feel that godzilla is portrayed here  arguably the best action flick overall in 2023the hype and rave reviews are legitgo see it
Dec 1 2023,positive,the movie was awesome the 4dx was off track so it was doing things when there was just a conversation and it was kinda annoying i wish it woulda synced up better
Dec 1 2023,positive,best toho godzilla movie to date the human characters and story were interesting and not just fillers between the monster stomping destruction  the big guy himself was more terrifying and powerful than everand thats a good thing 
Dec 1 2023,positive,what a wonderful and triumphant masterpiece for toho absolutely loved it if godzilla were not in this film it still would have been an emotional drama worth watching godzilla was fierce and scary as hell
Dec 1 2023,positive,this movie was purely amazing it was nice to see godzilla as a horror monster then as some action hero godzilla roaring sent shivers down my spine
Dec 1 2023,positive,the human drama is as compelling as the spectacle the best movie of the year

Dec 1 2023,positive,finally a perfect godzilla film acting  score writing and action
Dec 1 2023,positive,definitely going back to see it again  hopefully 4d
Dec 1 2023,positive,i have seen most of the godzilla movies and this y far the best i plan to buy the 4k dvd if it comes out for anyone that wondered if the original origin could be remade better this movie should convince you there is no raymond burr character but they do have a quick tip of the hat is a very dark way speaking of dark they do make godzilla out to be scary and most likely the most powerful variant by the way the acting was also the best i have seen even better than most of this years films a real tear jerker actually
Dec 1 2023,positive,this is the best godzilla film ive seen in 50 years well done

Dec 1 2023,negative,im really not sure what the critics are watching but it wasnt the same movie i saw pretty terrible pacing was off story was okay but strange editing choices acting was weird just strange didnt feel like genuine human reactions at many points made me laugh for than feel anything props to the actors you can tell they are really trying their hardest but man just bad lol it had a couple literally about 3 good lines and scenes characters make dumb decisions not enough godzilla just a huge disappointment i really would not recommend this to anyone

Dec 1 2023,positive,the main character has top tier acting probably the most talented actor ive seen in a while the human plot is so well done and gets you so invested the movie does an amazing job of capturing the damages and destruction godzilla causes the first design had me a little worried but once i saw godzillas true look it was in awe they did an absolutely amazing job with the design and effects that it really made godzilla horrifying i hope to see more from toho soon
Dec 1 2023,positive,after seeing this at the early screening i can say this is my favorite godzilla movie and in my top 5 movies finally a movie that isnt just a fun monster movie but an in depth character study and period piece that lives up if not improves upon the original the arc of koichi learning to live is beautiful and perfectly fits the story and the time period while the effects are a bit clunky at the for a 15 million dollar movie it rivals some 300 million dollar movies
Dec 1 2023,positive,a total mustsee it was a rollercoaster of emotions and a lot of beautiful visuals one of the best godzilla movies ever
Dec 1 2023,positive,this has to be one the the best godzilla movies ive seen the story was heartbreaking and i actually cared about the human characters godzilla looked incredible and was actually terrifying and had some amazing destruction scenes
Dec 1 2023,positive,this movie was a masterpiece definitely go watch it the acting was superb and godzilla was just pure evil there were some parts that were really sad and some people were actually tearing up the movie got a standing ovation  will be watching it again its only going to be in theaters for a week only so if you get a chance go watch this movie 
Dec 1 2023,positive,saw it last night it was very well put together the action was great the humans in the movie were very great it was like watching godzilla of old but up to date it truly is a great film
Dec 1 2023,positive,godzilla fans will be well pleased with this reimaged origin story i saw it at the imax screen it has a good story a little of godzilla raids again story line here how the japanese fight godzilla the tormented lead character is played well by the actor i dare say nongodzilla fans will like this movie just for the story  oh yeah godzillas frickin awesome in the movie damn 2 thumbs way up
Dec 1 2023,positive,heartfelt thrilling and above all else a masterpiece for any diehard fan or newcomer this is a must see film there is a fresh spin on godzillas abilities that was quite a surprise see in 4dx worth every penny
Dec 1 2023,positive,absolutely succeeds in being a character drama a period piece a war movie and above all else a monster movie it resonates on  a number of levels see it on a big screen if you can
Dec 1 2023,positive,if it aint the best godzilla movie to come out since the original its close in the runnings this is the movie that casual fans and movie goers can jump into and do so along side the crowd who fell in love with the people in rubber suits fair warning watch the trailers for the movie its the majority of the movie minus the final act how you feel during that minute and a half trailer is how you are going to feel the entire 2 hour runtime by the time the credits hit you will be exhausted and the movie will run rent free in your head the rest of your night see it as early as possible if you want to see it with the fans of the big guy for all these decades wait for the applause that will come from the crowded theater at the end     the story will keep you invested the pain you feel will be along side the characters who might face death at a moments notice when they are not trying to rebuild not just their lives but their broken selves godzilla is a money shot every frame he is on that camera the cinematography and the sound editing is insanely pulled through it was like the director had a sense of playfulness with his vision for maximum impact there is a double usage of godzillas original theme for his rampage but each use is done differently with the music pushing on a sense of beautiful irony as we get to our climactic moment even more interesting is its multitude of themes themes are very prevalent in this movie you have failure and shame sins of the past what dictates a family a subtle hint at the end of samurai culture as they tackle the notion of self sacrifice for the greater good and how as a nation they should look forward a strong antiwar message in my view a smaller one is this is a movie made by the grandsons of those alive during that time the ones who felt the effects of the ending of ww2 japan the original 1950s movie was a sense of a nation processing the atom bomb this movie is the next generations message going forward while looking at their own past
Dec 1 2023,positive,this movie was made for true gfans from the storyline to the visuals absolutely fantastic
Dec 1 2023,positive,everything a godzilla movie should be
Dec 1 2023,positive,this is the best godzilla movie ive ever seen hands down probably because its a movie first and godzilla is in it theres a real story involving humans the godzilla sequences are amazing and made more so because you are invested in the human characters this deserves an oscar nomination at least for best foreign picture
Dec 1 2023,positive,godzilla is a fuckin menace
Dec 1 2023,positive,first scene for real 
Dec 1 2023,positive,the scene of godzillas attack on ginza is nothing short of spectacular familiar landmarks like the nihon theater and ginza clock tower are systematically destroyed revealing godzillas malevolence and outright hostility towards humanity additionally there are many scenes filmed at godzillas feet intensifying the overwhelming scale of the creature the sheer magnitude of godzillas presence becomes palpable leaving a lasting impression
Dec 1 2023,positive,what a great movie thoroughly enjoyed myself
Dec 1 2023,positive,excellent film some aspects of which take inspiration from the original gojira as well as godzilla raids again the human plot is well done and keeps you engaged for the upcoming spectacle
Dec 1 2023,positive,this is a great movie that captures the same feeling i had when i first saw an old godzilla movie on the tv back in the 70s i was in complete awe the story was solid and godzilla was terrifying thank you toho
Dec 1 2023,positive,i saw this on early access fan night in imax  i really liked this movie  i thought the human aspect added so much to the story and made for a good movie  very well rounded  the only thing i would have liked to have seen would have been one more scene of godzilla destroying another city  one is never enough
Dec 1 2023,positive,the absolute best godzilla ive ever seen outstanding
Dec 1 2023,positive,the movie is exactly what youd expect  it was a good movie that did what it set out to do there was little things in the progression of the characters i didnt like to which it wont get a 5 star from me loved certain memorable scenes with godzilla that blew me away   this is the classic and fresh new era for the famous apex predator the cast was phenomenal  there were moments i felt my goosebumps yet this movie fell short at the 1 yard line and it was only because the writers and director fumbled to complete the masterpiece
Dec 1 2023,positive,three words godzilla welcome back
Dec 1 2023,positive,i appreciate that the movie focuses more on the human story vs just using the humans to transition between action set pieces that being said i wish there was one more action scene and one less dramatic humans scene or shorten one of the longer dramatic scenes to add an action scene the action sequences were incredible and the cg is very good considering the budget the acting is pretty good all around even though it drifts into b movie territory on occasion not really a bad thing id like to see this again in imax while its still in theaters
Dec 1 2023,positive,film was one of the best this year incredible characters and story godzilla is genuinely scary with his stare and dead emotion responses phenomenal filmmaking all around
Dec 1 2023,positive,movie felt a little long in certain moments but definitely the best godzilla movie ive seen
Dec 1 2023,positive,absolute banger modern hollywood should never be allowed to touch this ip again thank you toho
Dec 1 2023,positive,one of the best godzilla movies of all time and one of the best movies of this year
Dec 1 2023,positive,this was such a great movie a release from over cgied no story movies this being on a small budget was better than anything on a 200m budget the subtitles were not an issue nothing was rushed easy to follow and not miss the anything on the screen loved every minute serious contender for oscar  very emotional and you focused on godzilla every second he was on screen
Dec 1 2023,positive,i loved the action great cast members beautiful story line 
Dec 1 2023,positive,actually a great movie  even if there wasnt an awesome non westernized godzilla  i would watch this movie
Dec 1 2023,positive,this is something else this isnt your ordinary godzilla movie it is a masterpiece in my eyes genuine emotion and compelling characters a movie about the indomitable human spirit and how hope can make us prevail  this is one of the greatest cinematic experiences ive had    saw it on imax november 29th 2023

Dec 1 2023,positive,this is not just a good godzilla movie this is an excellent film no matter what standard you want to use go see it now before tohos limited time run is over
Dec 1 2023,positive,even more terrifying than the original color version almost thought i was watching the original 1954 film with how similar many of the shots looked hope this version is included with home releases will probably watch this edition over the color one due to how much more effective the scares are in bw
Nov 30 2023,positive,phenomenal movie and the godzilla design is amazing must see for anyone
Nov 30 2023,positive,just watched this movie it puts lengendarys movies to shame this is more than about godzilla its about the aftermath of ww2  in japan this is a move worth going to see its only in the us for a week
Nov 30 2023,positive,a decent but predictable story probably the best story for the people in a godzilla movie that ive seen though that bar is kind of low
Nov 30 2023,positive,this is truly a work of art for any godzilla fan to enjoy also the movie gives the best thrills of this year
Nov 30 2023,positive,there are few good hollywood movies nowadays superior to or on par with this one the exception being oppenheimer this movie is almost flawless and better than youd have expected meanwhile i cant remember the last time i walked out of a theater this way it is undoubtedly one of if not the great film of the decade so far all on a 15 million that just blows my mind
Nov 30 2023,positive,incredible the visuals the music the story the acting it all comes together to create one of the greatest godzilla movies ever made an absolute must see for any godzilla fan
Nov 30 2023,positive,damn good characters that i care about godzilla is actually the monster totally worth it
Nov 30 2023,positive,this is what a godzilla film should be

Nov 30 2023,positive,an absolutely amazing spectacle that youll have to see to believe the effects and score was absolutely amazing and the human story is one of the best in the whole godzilla franchise an amazing movie for both godzilla fans and average movie goers will love cant recommend it more go see it in theaters and experience the monstrous godzilla in theaters
Nov 30 2023,positive,i can never get enough godzilla in my zilla movies but thats me this movie is top 5 for sure i cant wait to see the next one finally a great story and good human drama mixed in a must watch for fans and casuals
Nov 30 2023,positive,this movie was absolutely amazing i loved everything part of it i usually go to godzilla movies to see the g man rain terror on humans but this movie had me invested in the lives and wellbeing of the human characters and not just godzilla overall it is a must watch for anyone who loves a compelling story and giant monsters
Nov 30 2023,positive,amazing best godzilla has ever been
Nov 30 2023,positive,this was such a great cinematic experience minus one is as much a horror film as it is a war drama definitely harkened back to the dark tone of the original godzilla and got some jaws vibes as well the human characters served as an integral part to the plot and definitely added depth and emotion such great cinematography as well possibly the best looking toho godzilla yet overall this movie was the perfect reboot to the toho godzilla i cant wait to watch it again
Nov 30 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is a masterpiece surpassing even godzilla 1954 in my opinion i consider it the best godzilla film ever made effectively it serves as a perfect remake of the 1954 classic devoid of 1950s american film restrictions for japanese film it sets out to tell a story of loss and hope narrating it in such a masterful way that you become attached to the characters without the need for language you could enter this film with no prior knowledge of its plot and emerge utterly stunned    as a godzilla fan i anticipated greatness but what i experienced left me so awestruck that i found myself unable to speak for a good 20 minutes every aspect of the film from the setting tone characters sound design soundtrack cinematography to the visual effects surpasses my ability to articulate how amazing it was especially when watching it in imax    what truly blows my mind is its modest budget of 15 million dollars it efficiently utilizes every dollar or technically yen so well that i find it challenging to return to most western entertainment without noticing flaws it genuinely brings joy to identify myself as a godzilla fan
Nov 30 2023,positive,humane horror for humans made by humans human equals additional suffering
Nov 30 2023,positive,a wonderful take on the classic  godzilla more ruthless and utterly terrifying in some scenes  just a touch of the corny we are accustomed to from older zilla movies  definitely hit the emotions for some as well and ended like any other godzilla movie should have
Nov 30 2023,positive,one of the best godzilla movies ever made the visuals are spectacular  probably the best human cast in a godzilla movie to date its a story of redemption a man who fled his destiny of being a kamikaze who was nearly driven mad by the shame a shifting of the times  are there cheesy moments absolutely its a godzilla movie but its one hell of a ride all hail godzilla minus one
Nov 30 2023,positive,its is an amazing monster movie
Nov 30 2023,positive,absolutely an amazing film from start to finish and frankly serves as a means to take godzilla back to its roots ultimately the movie benefits from a great sense of pacing and character which all culminate together to create a excellent film in godzilla minus one
Nov 30 2023,positive,godzilla minus one was cinema perfection in every way it told a compelling human story about disgrace honor and redemption godzilla in its 70 years of destruction has never been this terrifying pitting a staggered country again an overwhelming force showing a countrys will to change godzilla symbolizes japans atonement for their sins in ww2 at the same time he mirrors japans war culture pre war this movie deserves all the accolades coming to it and if america does not award it in some way hollywood is surly tone def  tony
Nov 30 2023,positive,i am a godzilla fan so all comments should be taken with that in mind  this movie met my every expectation  the characters are engaging the story is clear and the threat of the monster feels believable there is a touch of melodrama but given the setting and the events it would understandable that emotions run high  the characters delve a little into simplification and trope but this is a movie about a giant lizard so accuracy should be tempered  there is an elaborate plan to destroy the monster that is in keeping with godzilla history but nothing that is hokey  the acting is a little old fashioned but feels true to the historical setting  the visuals are wonderful  it is clear that they are not billion dollar but they are very good and in some ways had a better gut feeling  there may have been some practical model work or a concerted effort to reach that look depth of field as an homage  there are few clear homages to the original godzilla and some other movies but nothing distracting  there are few scenes of big g in action that were quite brutal in his effect on a recovering japanese population  his smaller size in comparison to recent movies works better for this movie there is some interesting pointofview camera work that went a long way to giving you the feeling of experiencing it firsthand the fact that it is subtitles only occurred to me the next day so clearly that did not distract i do prefer this over dubbing   overall a great effort by all involved i highly recommend for the casual or diehard fan  you will not be disappointed  some one who has no experience with godzilla do such people exist may come away wondering what all the fuss is about
Nov 30 2023,positive,godzilla minus one will go down in history for be one of the greatest if not the greatest godzilla movie of all time
Nov 30 2023,positive,even better than shin godzilla and shin godzilla was pretty good
Nov 30 2023,positive,fantastic movie efx are superb best looking godzilla ever brings the monster back to his roots soundtrack and all really nice story that accompanies the monster carnage see it on the bestsounding theatre you can
Nov 30 2023,positive,everything about this movie was perfect the music the cinematography and especially the effects the only criticism i would have would be the overly intense reactions of the characters at points but thats minor compared to the expertly crafted character arcs and strong messages 1010 for me
Nov 30 2023,positive,one of the greatest scifi movies i have ever seen i put the creature design up there on the level with some of my favorites such as the xenomorph from the alien franchise the predator and john carpenters the thing this is definitely one for imax 
Nov 30 2023,positive,a terrific film that takes godzilla seriouslyand so will you
Nov 30 2023,positive,excellent film great story and i cared for the human characters godzillas design mostly loved and great call back to the original films some cgi shotty at times
Nov 30 2023,positive,my brother and i loved it  first time we liked every single person in the movie and that a movie made you care about the story and characters
Nov 30 2023,positive,saw this in imax at the early screening fan event and it did not disappoint a visuals a soundtrack a message this is a movie about the people of a country coming together at its lowest point in a time when the government doesnt have the public interest in mind they nailed the human story and you really feel for the characters as you watch them only thing keeping it short of five stars is not enough of the big g himself i am definitely going to see it again in theaters
Nov 30 2023,positive,godzilla minus one exceeded all expectations delivering a truly phenomenal cinematic experience that is absolutely brilliant
Nov 30 2023,positive,i thought godzilla minus one was an incredible film it had great action suspense and even heart godzillas destructive and chaotic nature was a perfect foil to the japanese peoples resilience and determination to survive the final battle was truly a sight to behold and i enjoyed the touching message of hope and compassion that the film emphasized throughout overall its one of my new favorite films to watch and i would recommend it to anyone who loves monster movies
Nov 30 2023,positive,godzilla is back the true godzilla at least yes we may have had some fun with the legendary godzilla but toho just gets godzilla a force of nature that cant be bargained with or contained he is disaster incarnate the movie paces itself in such a perfect way and will leave you holding your breath for the next scene the acting and dialogue is impeccable this movie truly encapsulates the unrelenting spirit of man and the absolute terror of a walking bomb i will also mention godzillas atomic breath and design surpassed those of any godzilla iteration in this humble fans opinion an instant classic to introduce this terror to a new generation
Nov 30 2023,positive,i got early access tickets in america to see it in imax on 1129 it is truly a masterpiece it has the perfect balance of emotions and action between the character growth and fight scenes it is everything a godzilla fan could dream of it supersedes every film dating back to the original
Nov 30 2023,positive,very good i love godzilla live in a japanese film 
Nov 30 2023,positive,outstanding movie all any godzillas fan want its a new air fresh for the franchise this movie its a reminder of 1954 movie you can feel the fear of the japanese people in future a classic indeed
Nov 30 2023,positive,this movie was good it was everything i wanted in a godzilla moviethis is the perfect godzilla moviein almost every other godzilla movies i never cared about the humans i would root for godzilla to kill them since they were boring and uninterestingthis movie actually made root for the humans and hope godzilla goes away because i cared about themthe charachters were writen and acted welli was never bored when godzilla wasnt on screennow about godzilla he is perfectmaking him smaller was such a good idea it makes the deaths more personal because he can actually recognize the humans and he isnt killing them on accident he actually wants to kill themcgi i have no right to say it was bad its just insane what they could doo with a really small budgetthis movie is a 1010
Nov 30 2023,positive,for the first time i actually cared about characters in a godzilla movie the pacing is wonderful and godzillas screen time is wonderfully spaced out i guarantee you wont notice how frequent or infrequently he appears until you go back and skip through every scene hes not in
Nov 30 2023,positive,the film is incredible best solo godzilla film to date as godzilla being the antagonist its has everything you want in a godzilla film and the human aspect of the story has all of the heart absolutely must see cinema
Nov 30 2023,positive,absolute masterpiece of a film this is a high quality movie that also happens to be a godzilla film chefs kiss from toho
Nov 30 2023,positive,this is the true definition of a godzilla movie the story is beautifully told weaving through both the lives of the people of japan postwwii and the disaster that is godzillas destruction as someone who struggles with selfvaluation the characters in this movie i was both able to empathize with and become inspired by their struggles
Nov 30 2023,positive,this movie is a masterpiece the best godzilla ive seen in theaters the immersive sound and scope and scale of the visuals pulls you in to the dread of that world godzilla is mean menacing and aggressive total chaos and destruction and you actually care about the humans
Nov 30 2023,positive,been waiting for a new godzilla movie from toho for abit now and this movie delivers it was really good cant wait to see what they do or think of next
Nov 30 2023,positive,as big time kaiju films go this one is way up on the list it borders on fine cinema at parts i found myself forgetting it was a godzilla flick ive seen all 33 original japanese releases and i can honestly say this one right in there with the original godzilla 1954 and shin godzilla the difference is the story these are characters that are believable and you will care about what happens to them a few cheesy moments aside this is one that deserves a fresh rating
Nov 30 2023,positive,one of the best godzilla movies ever made  a masterpiece
Nov 30 2023,positive,the perfect godzilla movie and great for people not familiar with godzilla     it is a reboot of godzilla that takes place right after world war 2 an amazing retelling of the classic nuclear monster vs the people story    amazing visuals and emotionally engaging story     watch it as a double feature following oppenheimer and you are set 
Nov 30 2023,positive,great story hes a monster just beautiful imax was incredible and so was 4dx must watch
Nov 30 2023,positive,i went into this expecting some stupid fun what i got was a deep heartfelt movie about survivors guilt the characters are fleshed out really well this led me actually caring about people running from godzilla for the first time it is easily one of the 3 best godzilla films ever made it fits right in with the original gojira and shin godzilla i highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good kaiju movie but also wants characters to have depth
Nov 30 2023,positive,not only one of the best series of action sequences in a godzilla or monster film but minus one has probably the best human story to go along with it at least that ive ever seen in a monster film i hope to see american monster filmmakers take notes tight action sequences specific and meaningful human story and consistent vision     the american films surrounding monsters seem too preoccupied with cramming in as much as possible to their sets characters action scenes etc sometimes less is much much more     5 out of 5 atomic breaths
Nov 30 2023,positive,wow where do i even begin godzilla minus one is an absolute masterpiece i cant believe how good it is its a magnificent drama wrapped in godzilla clothes you could honestly take godzilla out and it would be a fantastic drama by itself but godzilla takes it over the top into one of the best movies of the year its scary emotional triumphant hopeful and a thrill to watch will be watching again soon 1010
Nov 30 2023,positive,thrilling monster movie amazing special effects and heartfelt human melodrama minus one is the whole package and the movie godzilla fans have been hoping for for decades
Nov 30 2023,positive,this movie was absolutely astonishing for me for two whole hours you are sucked into this eerie atmosphere as if you were actually there holding your breath in fear and anticipation this movie had me on my seats edge i couldnt get enough i stayed absolutely quiet as godzilla thunderous roar enveloped the theater i could swear you could hear it from outside this movie is an absolute must see that keeps you wanting more and for me im going back for more thank you takashi yamazaki for giving us this amazing gift of a film i loved every second of it
Nov 30 2023,positive,this was the best godzilla movie bravo toho
Nov 30 2023,positive,great writing the characters was ok but godzllia was js so good they actually made me feel the connection to 1954s godzilla really recommend it
Nov 30 2023,positive,i never write reviews but this movie is completely different than most godzilla movies i was fineunderstatement watching the performance of the humans and what they offered godzilla is godzilla and was awesome i was only let down by the budget but was still great film to look at if you know you know japanese movies can be more misses than hits in my opinion but this one is a hit and worth it at the movies
Nov 30 2023,positive,amazing movie character development was great godzilla was terrifying must see
Nov 30 2023,positive,this movie was magnificent godzilla has never been scarier or more vicious the human story was sad and heartfelt i cant wait to see it again
Nov 30 2023,positive,absolutely incredible movie went expecting a popcorn monster flick  but its so so much more its a movie about the trauma of military defeat the destruction of cities ptsd and survivors guilt the cast really bring the characters to life and make you root for them action is great but isnt what you take away todays pandering hollywood couldnt make this movie on its best day go see it and support this film
Nov 30 2023,positive,great great great movie i wish it was showing in xd more i plan on seeing it a few more times and buying it on 4k when it comes out
Nov 30 2023,positive,so good i saw it twice last night combining genres has become one of my favorite movie experiences of late this is a well conceived well told romanticactiongodzilla film i cared about every character throughout what a christmas present for movie goers
Nov 30 2023,positive,the story was amazing some of the graphics werent the best during water scenes but overall this film is awesome action dramaand horror all rolled together in a beautiful package
Nov 30 2023,positive,toho returns godzilla to its atomic roots with a story line that predates the original 1954 film the human drama reminded me of some of the early akira kirosawa films and the monster footage delivers in spades i am one of those longtime fans who still feels shin godzilla is one of the series best this film is at least as good as that one and at times perhaps better minus one manages to bring the character back to its original storyline but still manages to feel refreshing and even frightening at times i think the people behind most of the original series especially ishiro honda would be proud of this film if they were still with us highly highly recommended
Nov 30 2023,positive,as lifelong fan of godzilla i already had high expectations for godzilla minus one let me tell you this movie did not disappoint im certainly not one to love a godzilla movie just because of franchise loyalty im not afraid to criticize a godzilla movie however i dont think i have any criticisms of this film     if i had to describe this movie in one word it would be refreshing the downtoearth plot the genuine fear this movie provoked the new aspects of godzilla explored even the enticing human elements this movie brought with it godzilla minus one was such a refreshing film for the nearly 70 year old running franchise    with over 30 films under its belt one might question if theres anything novel a new installment could bring godzilla minus one confidently answers that question with a resounding yes godzilla minus one was a story worth telling and they executed it flawlessly
Nov 30 2023,positive,this movie is just great it has a human story as well as tons of destruction i rewatched kong vs godzilla the other day to compare them next to godzilla minus 1 its not even a popcorn flick just a lame story interrupted by i admit cool cgi effects     dont get put off by subtitles and japanese language if you do you will miss a truly great monster movie
Nov 30 2023,positive,my favorite godzilla movie a very grounded as much as a giant kaiju movie can be and emotional story that is easy to connect with
Nov 30 2023,positive,wow i would rank this as one of my top five favorite films of 2023 i was lucky enough to catch a fan event prescreening     just from watching the previews i had a feeling that it was going to be wellworth watching in a theater because of its production quality what i did not expect was that it was going to be a highstakes drama this movie is gripping heartwrenching quite frightening and more suspenseful than anything i expected if i tried to compare it to another movie it would have to be watching the original jaws for the first time there is one scene in particular when godzilla is pursuing our hero who is in his wornout tub of a minesweeper but this was even better than that    the director does an excellent job of sucking you into the horror and sadness of postwar japan it only took a few minutes for me to become heavily invested in the hero and then each of the side characters his foundfamily and friends the director also gives you the origin of godzilla and you can actually sense the difference in energy between his original and final form godzilla is furious vicious violent and horrific the violence in the film does not feel gratuitous  you are going to experience the shock and horror of the victims the airplane mechanics the people in ginza the unfortunates on the various ships and the ptsd the hero has from his encounters with godzilla unlike the godzilla movies from the 60s on you arent going to be able to savor the mayhem quite so much unless you lack human empathy    if you are going just to see godzilla you wont be disappointed though wow he is monstrous the graphics of him destroying ginza are incredible but it is when he is at sea that i found him to be the most frightening on land it seems like there is a chance to get away from him at sea it is a different story entirely     and finally there is a more realistic quality to this movie than the vast majority of monster movies in particular i liked how the plan they come up with to battle godzilla it felt thoughtful and possible    great fun dont pass up the chance to watch it in the theater
Nov 30 2023,positive,as a fan who has seen every godzilla movie godzilla minus one takes everything great in the past entrys and expands upon it the movie definitely deserves a 100 rating 
Nov 30 2023,positive,a nostalgic remake of the original which mixes loss and tragedy with the hope in postwar japan
Nov 30 2023,positive,best godzilla film to date perfect blend of monster meets man the human side of the movie was a gut punch that you couldnt look away from nor wanted to look away from the characters were well written and real no one felt safe from the destruction and the relationships between characters tugged heartstrings lets not forget the biggest part of the movie godzilla by far the most terrifying and stunning version of the monster to date the special effects and look of this were fanominal when first seeing the big g in action for the first time i could only stare slackjawed this movie made me feel all the emotions and showed no mercy a real love letter to fans and to film making too thank you so much for this
Nov 30 2023,positive,godzilla a captivating enigma of destruction with a stellar score    godzilla the iconic king of the monsters has captivated audiences for decades with its aweinspiring size and destructive power while many fans adore the creature as a symbol of natures untamed might others view it as a mindless force of destruction devoid of any redeeming qualities this film however manages to strike a delicate balance between these opposing perspectives revealing the creatures enigmatic nature while also highlighting the plight of the human characters caught in its path    from the outset the film establishes godzilla as an unpredictable force of nature its actions driven by primal instincts rather than any discernible logic its destruction is not motivated by malice but by a desperate need for survival and a yearning for connection this enigmatic nature is precisely what makes godzilla so captivating keeping audiences on the edge of their seats and wondering what it will do next    at the same time the film does not neglect the human element portraying the characters as complex individuals struggling to survive in the face of unspeakable devastation their desperation to avoid godzillas wrath and their resilience in the face of overwhelming odds underscore the creatures immense power and the profound fear it inspires    the films masterstroke lies in its ability to balance these two perspectives allowing audiences to appreciate godzillas enigmatic nature while also empathizing with the plight of the human characters this delicate balance elevates the film from mere monsterbashing spectacle to a profound exploration of the delicate balance between destruction and compassion    furthermore the films score deserves special mention the music is both epic and emotional perfectly capturing the films themes of destruction and resilience the score is one of the best ive heard in any film this year and it greatly enhances the overall viewing experience    in conclusion godzilla is a captivating film that succeeds in capturing both the allure of the enigmatic beast and the struggles of the human characters caught in its path its ability to balance these two perspectives coupled with its stellar score makes it a mustsee for fans of the genre and newcomers alike    rating 5 out of 5 stars
Nov 30 2023,positive,very reminiscent of the first movies  absolutely fabulous  if youre a slow reader like me dont shy away because of the subtitles  dialogue was not long speak or fast so easy to read and enjoy movie  this is one we will be seeing again in the theater  that is a first for me to see a movie twice
Nov 30 2023,positive,as a godzilla fan since i was the age of 5 or 6 i can tell you that this movie definitely is one or if not the best godzilla movie since the original 1954 godzilla the story plot of this movie is what makes a perfect godzilla movie its a story about defeat loss despair and hope when i watch godzilla movies the human characters can be either a hit or a miss i will say these characters are quite on pair with the original 54 movie and thats a huge achievement with this movie when godzilla shows up and see the destruction he leaves it was just perfect and it really shows the embodiment of what godzilla really is the music was perfect with all the moments and the graphics is superb overall i give this movie a 10 out of 5 if i had to this is a perfect movie for both g fans and nong fans please go and watch this movie
Nov 30 2023,positive,an homage to the original classic slight changes from original but they add more complexity to the overall symbolism and narrative that is the godzilla universe well done
Nov 30 2023,positive,in a world full of movies like the marvels and the flash japan comes out and absolutely demolishes american cinema by giving us the most enticing movie that in some ways surpasses the original gojira ishrio honda would be absolutely proud
Nov 30 2023,positive,you dont have to be a fan of godzilla to enjoy this movie it has a solid storyline minus the glitz and corny oneliners that youd find in a hollywood production
Nov 30 2023,positive,absolutely stunning the entire movie was a spectacular masterpiece the story and humans were wonderfully written while godzilla himself was terrifying but also so damn cool 1010
Nov 30 2023,positive,my family and i saw an early showing last night it was fantastic godzilla was the scariest in any movie ive ever seen and the japanese theme and subtitles was the most authentic as well  the acting was a little bad but that also makes it more authentic to the original godzilla movies absolutely loved i
Nov 30 2023,positive,ive been watching godzilla for 50 years its a coin toss as to whether this film or godzilla 54 is the best for a modern audience id have to give the nod to godzilla 1  this is a much different experience than the current legendary series plenty of call backs for longtime fans while at the same time this should be a great film for general audiences i think hondatanaka and tusburaya would give godzilla 1 a big thumbsup
Nov 30 2023,positive,excellent movie  it is a great origin story and hopefully a great reboot for more godzilla movies from toho  a perfect 70th anniversary piece  i was totally invested in all of the characters and loved the ending    i need more of this  hollywood can learn a thing or two about how to make a movie
Nov 30 2023,positive,great new twist on the original with great focus on the characters and how wwii affected them
Nov 30 2023,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed the movie  loved the incorporation of the original music score  even use of the original godzilla roar  the story pulls you in  you actually care about the characters having to deal with not only godzilla but trying to recover after wwii  i hope they let the director continue on with his vision  the ending definitely sets up for a continuation  went to two early access screenings on wednesday  plan to see it again in imax  sadly no dolby atmos theater around me that is playing it
Nov 30 2023,positive,all hail and bravo to this monumental and spectacular epic of a movie
Nov 30 2023,positive,absolutely beautiful an amazing score beautiful vfx and amazing characters that you care about with motivations and flaws 1010
Nov 30 2023,positive,ive been dedicated fan of gojira for all of my 21 years of being on this planet i have seen all the highs and lows this series has to offer from its campy moments to the beautiful scores haunting moments and awesome action so when i put in perspective how genuinely refreshing this movie was for an long time fan to see both the monster its meaning in nuclear symbolism  and its human characters all being both grounded in a gritty yet emotional focus and still remember its a godzilla movie at its core the king of the monsters has truly come back with a vengeance and i implore anyone fan critic or average movie goer give minus one your time this film is a master class and a frightening amazing experience long live the king
Nov 30 2023,positive,capturing the terror that godzilla still hold is step one giving you a fantastic group of humans that you want to win step two heat ray three what a fantastic film to keep 70 years going strong
Nov 30 2023,positive,absolutely incredible nice feeling a sense of dread seeing him in action
Nov 30 2023,positive,third time seeing it and it just gets better pays so much homage to the original 1954 movie as well as some others second best if not the best godzilla movie
Nov 30 2023,positive,pretty much the perfect godzilla movie  the monster action and destruction is amazing but the human story is also really compelling and touching
Nov 30 2023,positive,almost everything ive wanted to see in a godzilla film since i was a child
Nov 30 2023,positive,godzilla is a destructive force of nature that crushes everything and everyone in its path without cause without reason without regard the combination of akira ifukubes powerful music and naoki satos terrifying strings makes you shiver with pleasure when its time to stomp and annihilate godzilla minus one manages to constantly catapult you into a perpetual feeling of helplessness in the face of the inevitable godzilla minus one is the best movie since the 1954 godzilla
Nov 30 2023,positive,the best use of humans in the entire franchise and probably the coolest versuon of godzilla yet
Nov 30 2023,positive,definitely a great godzilla movie that needs to be seen on the big screen the human characters were actual likeable and godzilla was a threat that was felt
Nov 30 2023,positive,this was emphatically the greatest godzilla movie ever made such beautiful and compelling story telling beautiful cinematography relatable and empathetic characters amazing special effects and most of all the most terrifying and gruesome and believable rendition of godzilla ever portrayed on the big screen this whole film i could find no flaw
Nov 30 2023,positive,the godzilla movie ive been waiting 20 years for   go see it in an imax theatre its  more visceral watching godzilla in action absolutely loved it  going again
Nov 30 2023,positive,godzilla minus one was perfection blending classic godzilla with modern action and visuals to create something so memorable emotional and haunting godzilla is a force more than ever and the story couldnt have been more touching this took my breath away    for starters the humans are some of if not the best in any godzilla film the story and journey these characters go through feel earned and by the end of the film you feel and care for each and everyone of them    godzilla was an absolute force to be reckoned with his atomic breath might actually be my new favorite of the franchise the ocean scene kept me frozen he was haunting extremely powerful and looked phenomenal which leads me to talking about the effects leaving the theater all i could think about was the saddest part of watching that film was knowing that it probably wont get the recognition it deserves come award season especially for its effects the cgivisual effect were all polished not once did it dip in quality    the score for this film was beyond beautiful touching at times i got emotional just by music queues multiple times during the film at times it was bone chilling hype and gut wrenching other times seat clenching and even had elementsfull tracks from the original    it was emotional action packed had a beautiful story gorgeous visuals and brisk pacing that never dragged godzilla is the monster we all hoped for with humans that felt tangible this is one for the ages and i mean that with zero hesitation actually minus one    i highly recommend seeing this in theaters as soon as possible but please make sure its on the biggest screen you can find
Nov 30 2023,positive,i saw this movie in japan and again in the united states in imax this movie is a different type of godzilla movie than the legendary movies or the previous japanese godzilla movies this film is much darker and more serious in tone the acting is some of the best ive ever seen come out of japan this iteration of godzilla is no hero hes far more primal in nature as well the main characters which is a place godzilla films are usually lackluster were characters you could get more emotionally attached to than in prior films i dont want to spoil anything so ill just leave it at when i saw this movie in japan i didnt expect to experience a theater of people emotionally drained and many crying
Nov 30 2023,positive,such a great blend of the more modernized godzilla while still giving the movie heart and everything we love about the orginal
Nov 30 2023,positive,easily a top godzilla movie great mix of action and character moments in a post ww2 japan nice visuals acting and sound godzilla here is a force of nature and does not disappoint
Nov 30 2023,positive,i managed to get tickets for an early access fan screening yesterday and as a life long godzilla fan i can say with ease that this is in the top 5 godzilla films ever made     a common complain amongst godzilla fans and critics in general is that the human characters are often forgettable and cause the film to drag this movie is the exact opposite i cared and was invested in nearly every human story introduced      godzilla was the destructive force of nature weve come to expect and setting it in the backdrop of a real world 1940s where technology is the most limited weve ever seen in a godzilla film made for one of the most edge of your seat godzilla vs humans battles of all time do not miss this movie second best film of the year after oppenheimer who ironically enough probably caused godzilla to wake up
Nov 30 2023,positive,movie was amazing definitely seeing this one again highly recommended
Nov 30 2023,positive,best godzilla movie ever and the best movie of 2023 nuff said

Nov 30 2023,positive,truly a modernday masterpiece in filmmaking and storytelling not only were they able to capture the compelling character development of the original 1954 film but they brought godzilla back to his horrific roots and made the titular monster scary again 1010 well done

Nov 30 2023,positive,this movie has the best story of any godzilla movie i know for a godzilla movie thats not saying much but the movie could hold its own with high quality hollywood films i thought the human story was very good and well acted if you prefer godzilla fighting other monsters and dont care for the human story then this movie is probably not for you the cgi isnt as good as a high budget hollywood movie but its definitely the best of the japanese films overall i think this is the best godzilla film and ive seen them all
Nov 30 2023,positive,best godzilla in a long time closest thing to 54 og must see for godzilla fans
Nov 30 2023,positive,the best movie godzilla has ever been in not quite sure if its the best godzilla movie tho hes the most devastating with doing some of the least amount of devastation on land other than his atomic breath
Nov 30 2023,positive,this is the best godzilla movie ever produced
Nov 30 2023,positive,best godzilla movie ever and a great movie and story that stands on its own sometimes it doesnt feel like youre watching a monster movie this movie achieves what hollywood has failed to do with many sci fi or monster moviesgood character development and compelling stories    it also does a good job of preserving the roots of the original 1950s godzilla film complete with the music and also the setting of postwar japan even has a small hint of the cheesiness of the original franchise at times but its not over the top    best movie weve seen this year in the theaters
Nov 30 2023,positive,absolutely surpassing any previous godzilla movies with a captivating story and a grand scale immersive outlook of a newly design for godzilla

Nov 30 2023,positive,after seeing it early for the fan event godzilla minus one is everything a godzilla movie should be and so much more everything about this movie from the characters music emotion tension dread and especially godzilla himself are top notch this is a must watch and likely the best entry into the godzilla series well deserving of the kings 70th anniversary
Nov 30 2023,positive,godzilla minus one spoiler review    101    at this time i cannot decide if i like minus one better or my old favorite godzilla against mechagodzilla first things first this is by far the best version of godzilla i knew as soon as takashi yamazaki was making it the design was going to be amazing just by his godzilla in its always sunny on third street what i didnt expect was everything else this godzilla movie is 100 a horror movie the beginning scene with godzilla as a more dinosaur like creature was amazing thats the kind of godzillasaurus i wanted to see his atomic breath is awesome the spikes coming out and going in was fine i didnt like it any more or any worse that the normal glowing spikes but the atomic breath itself is beautiful with godzilla being the metaphor for the bombing of japan his atomic breath actually creating a nuke like explosion was a perfect touch i didnt realize godzilla needed and his death at the end was the second best godzilla death in my opinion nothing can beat heisei melting down now the actual plot unlike most godzilla films this movie has one of the best character driven storys its stars a kamikaze pilot who pretended that his plain was broken to skip out on dying the twist and turns his story had were so compelling i almost forgot about godzilla his later to be wifes death i saw coming but it later being revealed to fake with her actually surviving was the biggest twist in this movie there where many small nods to older godzilla films that will excite long time fans but thats not at all what makes this movie good while i had a heavily bias opinion on the movie my friend who has only seen shin godzilla also thought this movie was fantastic and of course every scene with the godzilla theme is amazing
Nov 30 2023,positive,a 100 is the lowest score i will accept for this movie
Nov 30 2023,positive,overall i think this has a better plot than the godzilla movies that the monsterverse has i really connected with the characters and like how it was mostly from one persons point of view i have two main issues with it with one being that the pace shouldve been a little faster and just felt too slow for me dont get me wrong i liked how we got to know the human characters but the pace still couldve been improved on my second issue is that theres hardly any godzilla whats the point of this being a godzilla movie if theres hardly  any godzilla
Nov 30 2023,positive,freaking amazing most interested human story ever in a godzilla movie
Nov 30 2023,positive,this is by far the best overall godzilla movie since the japanese original godzilla is absolutely horrifying in this film this is the most devastating portrayal of his atomic breath ever the human story is usually a weakness in these films but here it is a solid endearing story
Nov 30 2023,positive,an absolute masterclass from beginning to end that serves almost as a pseudo remake of the original while updating it for modern audiences
Nov 30 2023,positive,toho has taken godzilla back to the basics with a compelling and delectably   destructive story with great character arcs that make every character feel like they belong a dire situation that keeps you hoping the heroes win and a monster you just cant wait to see on the screen again and again as it makes a thunderous and profound mark on the film modern blockbusters should take note this is how you make a movie worth seeing in the theaters
Nov 30 2023,positive,absolutely epic like the japanese original only 1000000x better in every way the 2nd best godzilla creature ever sorry the new us godzilla is bonkers awesome but so is this one what a time to be a kotm fan 1000 stars
Nov 30 2023,positive,it is the best godzilla movie you probably will ever watch ive seen almost every godzilla movie i like or love almost every one of them but none of them compare to this movie its strong character movie its like old godzilla meets new godzilla it takes place back in world war ii times but you have the special effects of modern day so you get the best of both worlds of godzilla you should see this i saw it in imax  i hope you get the chance to also 
Nov 30 2023,positive,it has been years since i saw a movie this intense and amazing a must watch
Nov 30 2023,positive,im not sure it deserves to be 100 but it was entertaining great special effects fantastic acting from the principal actors and actually did something oppenheimer failed to do show the devastation and aftermath of the h bomb dropped on japan i enjoyed the secondary storyline immensely and even if you dont take any of that into consideration godzilla eats a freakin train in my opinion that trumps everything
Nov 30 2023,positive,hands down best godzilla movie since the original and frankly the best movie of the year  i was in awe of the imagery and godzilla was truly a spectacle  gritty and emotional every scene with godzilla felt ironically personal the human story was heartbreaking and also endearing  as a life long fan i am grateful for the respect shown for this iconic monster  visually so impressive with a raw human element that finally really works not seen since the first film  dare i say it might even get a few awards or noms
Nov 30 2023,positive,there was a great deal of character development in the movie a country still recovering from wwll the spirit of the movie was about recovery and wrestling with fear when faced with destruction once again by the ravages of godzilla the people draw close to take on an impossible task there was a great deal of tension between the two main characters and you expect a romance to bud but due to personal battles concerning the war the romance is not fully realized really heartbreaking at one point but not giving anything away the movie does not leave you disappointed as they battle godzilla and deal with the demons of the past i would say this was more of a drama than a old fashioned godzilla movie
Nov 30 2023,positive,excellent movie with exceptional character development and moving story there were no cheesy bits and was an overall excellent monster movie that happened to have great story telling with good acting a movie that showed the horros of war and promulgated a succinct commentary on government shortfalls and the perils of nuclear war my favorite godzilla movie by far and a must watch even for non g fans
Nov 30 2023,positive,this movie was astonishingly surprising and both as a critic and a godzilla fan it was well kept with a very intriguing human story and very well balanced monster scenery and interaction this movie defines what godzilla truly is and what a godzilla movie in the future or past could andor should be a very fantastic movie
Nov 30 2023,positive,the best godzilla film yet amazing twist on the original story it was deep dealing with ww2 and the atrocities of nuclear war and the aftermath of destruction  
Nov 30 2023,positive,this movie is a must see
Nov 30 2023,positive,i just finished seeing it and i loved it it was honestly very good and godzilla was ruthless and that was needed i miss the evil godzilla and this delivered it almost got me tearing up at some parts                spoiler the way they almost killed godzilla with a inflatable was kinda funny
Nov 30 2023,positive,amazing godzilla has some real attitude in this one its almost the complete opposite of shin godzilla and yet still manages to be on par with it solid 1010 that i want to spoil so bad but wont definetly a must see and will be added to my collection once its available
Nov 30 2023,positive,amazing movie not just for a godzilla movie but in general an amazing movie
Nov 30 2023,positive,instant classic a masterpiece the performances were exceptional even if you are a diehard godzilla fan you find yourself rooting for the supporting cast this godzilla is truly menacing
Nov 30 2023,positive,words cannot explain how incredible and amazing this movie truly was it had characters you cared for and a sad heartfelt story that keeps you satisfied while godzilla is off screen when he is on screen however is when this film reaches another level the greatest movie ive seen this year thus far 1010
Nov 30 2023,positive,just returned from an imax screening really good cinematography in this one not as much action as shin godzillamonsterverse movies but godzillas attack on tokyo is very intense and the human portion of the story is arguably the best ive seen in any godzilla film its a very good sorta remake of gojira
Nov 30 2023,positive,absolutely incredible not just a good godzilla movie but a good movie in general fantastic acting gorgeous cinematography and an emotional story what about the big guy he was downright terrifying ferocious and truly felt like a force of nature from his first scene to the last godzilla delivered on the spectacle one would expect absolutely brilliant
Nov 30 2023,positive,great action and storytelling this godzilla movie actually has a very well thought out storyline and makes the characters very interesting and likable there is also just enough character screen time and godzilla screen time and pacing was great this movie is a must watch even if your not a big godzilla fan and i feel could be close to movie of the year go see it now
Nov 30 2023,positive,this movie was astonishingly surprising it was well kept with a very intriguing human story with very well balanced monster scenery and interaction this movie defines what godzilla truly is and what a godzilla movie in the future or past could andor should be a very fantastic movie
Nov 30 2023,positive,i love it this was my first godzilla movie but i was bawling my eyes out with some scenes and felt so many emotions that not many movie do 1010 would and will see it again
Nov 30 2023,positive,movie were awesome for the first time in a long time i enjoyed the human element in a godzilla movie love clever way they did the easter eggs and the most important thing my youngest son 9 year old enjoyed it and he wants to watch it again this weekend
Nov 30 2023,positive,must watch in imax to experience the full dread you will feel coursing through your body as godzilla is on screen
Nov 30 2023,positive,best godzilla film in forever it truly does the original justice
Nov 30 2023,positive,excellent movie looked great on the big screen
Nov 30 2023,positive,godzilla minus one is a cinematic masterpiece its seriously written like an oscar nomination film in terms of characterization of the cast im shocked to say this film did the impossible its either on the same tier as gojira 1954 or surpasses it sound design was remarkable too the director did a tremendous job giving us shots and sequences weve never seen before with godzilla easily a 1010
Nov 30 2023,positive,this is the greatest godzilla movie of the modern era     no shade thrown at the legendary pictures theyre a completely different monster pun partially intended but this godzilla proves that you dont need to keep making the kaiju bigger for them to be terrifying from his first appearance early in the film to the heartpounding climax this godzilla is closer to the humans he terrorizes than any since the original 1954 classic the difference in scale creates a completely different kind of dread  something in between a colossal apex predator and a force of nature    the people in this film for maybe the first time in the history of godzilla movies steal the show godzilla is the backdrop against which postwwii japan struggles with the horrors and guilt inherent in survival of mass destruction and whether or not those who came home from war ever truly stopped fighting it koichi shikishima and his found family challenge the audience to do more than simply keep surviving    i have seen many different iterations of godzilla over the decades minus one is the most successful version since the original king of the monsters to tell the story of nuclear horror and how humankind has to be willing to do more than fight to the death they need to find the strength to live
Nov 30 2023,positive,i just arrived home after watching the early screening brilliant on every level  human monster metaphoric every level  you care about the main characters their emotional trauma and their motivations this is an angry godzilla and it works because godzilla is a metaphor for the cruelty and senselessness of war
Nov 30 2023,positive,best godzilla best sound
Nov 30 2023,positive,a once in a generation film absolutely incredible one of the greatest monster films of all time
Nov 30 2023,positive,if oppenheimer didnt release this year godzilla minus one would be the film of the year this i can say is absolutely better than a masterful film like dunkirk this is true cinema
Nov 30 2023,positive,first godzilla movie ive ever seen and definitely one of the best movies ive seen everyone clapped at the end and i heard people talking about how good it was on the way out 100 on rotten tomatoes too a testament to just how good this movie is
Nov 30 2023,positive,loved it best out of zilla movies
Nov 30 2023,positive,amazing 1010 and the music was incredible
Nov 30 2023,positive,one of the best godzilla movies i have seen i was hesitant about the human storyline but it was intertwined throughout the film very well and compelling enough to keep you engaged godzilla was awesome as usual a must watch and great addition to the franchise
Nov 30 2023,positive,saw the movie in a dolby cinema theater and it was absolutely top tier i highly suggest you see this in at least imax or dolby as the sound experience is next level the human story really drives home the theme of fighting to live and not wasting life along with the messages learned from ww2 ptsd regret etc the human interactions really made this movie worth seeing and godzilla is the vessel we see through then when you focus on godzilla his class theme song roar and the heat raynuclear blast is eye  ear candy the only nitpick i have is that some cgi is a little weird with him and the backgroundscities overall no complaints 1010
Nov 30 2023,positive,i am not a fan of monster movies my husband is a huge godzilla fan so i followed along thinking id have a nice nap during the movie i was so wrong the story is captivating and moving the cgi was masterful and godzilla was amazing im telling everyone to go see it the only downside is it not being in american theaters for very long so go watch it

Nov 30 2023,positive,godzilla minus one goes deeper than almost any godzilla film prior to it and delves into topics rarely discussed during monster films the heart from director yamazaki is apparent from the opening scene and is carried throughout the entire film
Nov 30 2023,positive,incredible  one of the best experiences youll have this decade at the movies

Nov 30 2023,positive,was a very satisfying and fulfilling spectacular movie
Nov 30 2023,positive,the movie really surprised me godzilla actually feels monstrous he was actually terrifying and felt like a force of nature when on the screen additionally the human part of the story was not just the godzilla waiting room the story was engaging and i came to really care about what would happen to the cast of characters easily one of the best experiences ive had watching movies in 2023

Nov 30 2023,positive,one of the greatest godzilla films ever made and one of the best films released this year
Nov 30 2023,positive,japanese cinema has done what hollywood has been unable to do make an entertaining film with real human characters real human story arcs great action and a compelling story applause tears excitement  the audience was enthralled by this not another cookie cutter super hero movie or blockbuster no ridiculous story line or empty characters godzilla minus one is how movies should be made
Nov 30 2023,positive,best godzilla movie ive seen in years the atomic beam is the coolest how the dorsal plates pop out right before nuking the entire city and that one boat scene where the boat explodes great movie would come for part 2
Nov 30 2023,positive,after the first watch this movie might be my favorite godzilla movie of all time great acting good plot and the pacing was great never at any point during the movie did i ever feel bored godzilla feels terrifying in this adaptation especially when we first see him not only is this movie scary but it also does an amazing job at portraying post ww2 japan you can feel the desperation and depression in the characters throughout the movie overall i feel like it has a great mix of everything you would want in a movie and would definitely recommend it
Nov 30 2023,positive,loved it  one of the best godzilla films all of the flavor of the 50s70s films with characters that you actually grow to care about absolutely worth the popcorn and springing for imax if you can find it
Nov 30 2023,positive,other than the cgi not being great but also not horrendous this was an overall entertaining story i think unlike most im not a big fan of a godzilla that has no purpose and therefore is nothing more than a destructive force aimlessly reducing villages towns and cities to rubble but i get and can appreciate the metaphor
Nov 30 2023,positive,amazing story  great special effects  great acting  epic score  my favorite film of 2023
Nov 30 2023,positive,this is the best solo godzilla film since its 1954 original film it was very well balanced out between the human characters and the kaiju himself and the story was very postwar feel especially for the citizens of japan and what the hardship they went through in the aftermath
Nov 30 2023,positive,great movie and story
Nov 29 2023,positive,godzilla minus one director takashi yamazaki has done it the film is a triumph     yamazakis mastery of vfx shines through in this latest godzilla movie seamlessly blending astonishing visuals with a gripping human story this entry into the godzilla franchise reads like a dramatic period piece with a monster horror element all the actors deliver heartfelt meaningful performances that connected me to their characters like no other godzilla film has before    i truly believe minus one will be remembered as an important piece of kaiju movie history its a movie that celebrates the endurance of the human spirit and our ability to evolve when thrust into the chaos of conflict while remaining accessible to both fans and newcomers alike
Nov 29 2023,positive,i am japanese i saw it in a japanese movie theater and am typing using the translation i think theres a good chance that people who love godzilla will enjoy it
