Apr 9 2024,negative,i watch a lot of good scifi all the terminators predators aliens avps stargate startrek etc the original dune was horrible in everyway possible this dune was even worse and more boring than the original the second dune is just as bad probably the worse movies of any genre ive ever seen

Apr 5 2024,positive,great movie great cast great special effects great story love the movie
Apr 5 2024,positive,the 1984 movie was the best even compared to this paul is so much more in the original movie the new paul is just a pampered aristocrat and the actor cant emote he is lacking and dead faced modern actors are all dead pan looks and no emotion just graphically airbrushed standins i love the story so much i have watched the new movie about 3 times the original i have watched at least 50 times
Apr 5 2024,positive,this film was absolutely excellent and finally adapted a difficult story into a sensical film unlike the previous hollywood attempts exactly the refreshing movie that jaded theater goers needed when it came out im very excited for the sequel
Apr 4 2024,positive,2nd one makes this better
Apr 3 2024,positive,lets hope its building for something great in part 2
Apr 3 2024,positive,until this film people thought dune was unadaptable to the big screen but denis villeneuve proved them wrong
Apr 3 2024,negative,dune is overrated for me personally the story is nothing special the acting is lukewarm and the explanation of what is happening is rather weak the only good thing about dune is the effectsproduction
Apr 3 2024,positive,i loved it its beautiful slow but not boring
Apr 3 2024,positive,i dont find the movie to be great i felt it was too slow it was hard to get into these characters the main character did like nothing whole movie which bugged me but when dune part 2 it should be better but this movie just was fine i like the cinematography and the score but everything else was ok 76
Apr 2 2024,positive,not bad much better than the original for once
Apr 2 2024,positive,the best sci fi epic of the last 30 years there isnt a negative aspect to this film denis villenueve does it once again just like with blade runner 2049 creates an immersful deep  rich world one i cant wait to go deeper into
Apr 2 2024,positive,a little boring it cant stand on its own at all because its just worldbuilding for the second part and doesnt really have any payoff but really good acting and cinematography prop this movie up
Mar 31 2024,positive,a little slow yes a little plain yes a magnificent technical achievement absolutely an awesome cinematic experience of course many people tend to forget that this is just an introduction the first part of something bigger the preparation of the table for the big banquet
Mar 31 2024,positive,dune 2021 garners praise for its cinematic scale visual and auditory magnificence though some critics find its pacing and tone challenging the performances especially timothée chalamets are lauded but the films seriousness and lack of humor have drawn mixed reactions its narrative feels like a prologue leaving audiences eager yet unsatisfied awaiting a sequel for closure
Mar 31 2024,neutral,overrated i dont get the fuss about the movie beside the esthetics
Mar 30 2024,positive, 7010      2h 35m long loreal paris commercial grade b
Mar 30 2024,positive,the story line and the acting are very good however it does not need to be that long it could be half the time if all the scenes of staring into the distance and panning the scenery was cut down significantly it made the story drag needlessly
Mar 30 2024,positive,hands down one of the best films ive seen since my mother took me to see fellowship of the ring in 2001 in the cinema
Mar 30 2024,positive,caveat in order to fully appreciate the plot and not be lost initially it helps greatly to have read the book or have seen the 1984 david lynch version first if you already understand the dune universe youre in for a stunning visuals and epic updated version
Mar 30 2024,positive,epic in every aspect just epic
Mar 29 2024,negative,that was a huge waste of 2 hours of my life nothing about this movie called my attention besides the good actors that it had it was slow and boring and we had to pause it 3 times to take a break so that we didnt fall asleep out of boredom i dont really understand how this got so many great reviews
Mar 29 2024,negative,could barely stay awake
Mar 29 2024,negative,i liked it until i realized it was to be a multiplepart series  adapting a book to the big screen takes time and obviously requires a longer movie runtime but waiting years between releases is a major turnoff  havent seen part 2 and likely wont
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie is amazing in every way except for the fact the movie had an unsatisfactory ending
Mar 29 2024,positive,dune part 1 is a film that i pay of respect towards rather than i enjoy watching it this is because it is extremely difficult to follow if you havent read the books
Mar 29 2024,positive,a bit slow but still built on the characters and loved it overall
Mar 29 2024,positive,extremely well done  the music and cinematography in particular are outstanding
Mar 29 2024,positive,havent finished watching it yet  just over halfway throughsometimes its a bit slow going and i lose interest but i have to say the worst part of this movie is rebecca fergusons actingomg her constant whispering and forced dramatic faces is the main reason i cant focus on this movie how the heck did she ever get this part she needs to go back to acting school or find another career
Mar 25 2024,positive,great movie watched 4 times already
Mar 25 2024,positive,excellent movie only thing holding it back from a 55 is the slower pacing
Mar 25 2024,positive,beautiful movie just gorgeous would watch again
Mar 25 2024,positive,solid film a little too slow in the beginning
Mar 24 2024,positive,great start it sets the story for something bigger
Mar 24 2024,negative,boring  25 hours of my life ill never get back
Mar 24 2024,negative,this movie was dogsht clearly noone read the book so much was altered andor left out some acting was atrocious  some actors shouldnt have even gotten their roles chani wasnt an annoying little b dogsht
Mar 24 2024,positive,55 hits all the marks and does so with great casting and exceptional visuals and sound was it faithful to the books no but realistically since he stated from the beginning he intended to only do the book in two movies that wasnt realistic i think it hit the marks it needed to tell the story if you want a more faithful telling id suggest the scifi channels miniseries because while lacking in visuals and sound did a much better job on that end
Mar 23 2024,positive,an immersive and impressive portrayal of the novel letting the viewer bask in the stunning imagery and worldbuilding  puts every other adaptation of this work to absolute shame
Mar 23 2024,positive,amazing best scifi movie in literal years
Mar 23 2024,positive,never read the book but i loved the movie both one and two beautiful cinematography interesting characters and really cool costume design my favorite part about it was the world building super unique and creative
Mar 23 2024,positive,great a saga is born
Mar 22 2024,positive,i literally made an account so i could rate this movie i think about this movie daily  its my roman empire
Mar 22 2024,negative,1984s dune is so full of david lynchs somber atmosphere so intriguing villeneuves watered down version is some kind of star wars but boring
Mar 22 2024,positive,i love that i watched it about four times now
Mar 22 2024,positive,i think they put way to much money and time in that movie for it to turn out like it did i was very very disappointed with part 1 and now disappointed with pt 2 esp the fact that it seems ti imply a pt 3 i hope not  the 1984 version was so much better and the actors did a far better job with alot less money i stretched to give it a 3
Mar 21 2024,positive,one of the best movies ive seen it doesnt compare to anythingsuch great actors and all praise to denis
Mar 21 2024,positive,it was a pretty good movie
Mar 21 2024,negative,nothing about it is good skipped through the entire thing the story isnt any good the acting is wooden the dialog is atrocious just not for me
Mar 21 2024,positive,movie started out very slow but got better as it went on plot was confusing at times overs well done movie just needed to be shorter
Mar 20 2024,positive,i have no words this is cinema at its greatest the acting is great it is the perfect mix of action and dialogue and the plot is amazing the only scifi thing i can think is better is the original star wars or the book version of dune so much for no words
Mar 20 2024,positive,i love to kick back and relax to a threehour transhumanist space opera with elements of social science fiction helps me unwind in the evening
Mar 19 2024,positive,best movie i have seen in a long time ive watched it 3 times i usually do not rewatch movies
Mar 19 2024,positive,slow but beautifully shot with interesting world building the movie takes time to take off but the overall experience is quite spectacular acting cinematography direction all top notch a worthy adaptation that even non book readers can follow and enjoy
Mar 19 2024,negative,it was a long drawn out boring film
Mar 19 2024,positive,a film that was at once wonderful and mediocre    when it comes to the technical and visual aspects its hard to find a better technical execution and special effects in recent years a film whose sound was in wonderful synergy with what was on screen in this respect at least hans zimmer was at the top of his game the visuals were also very spectacular and evoked powerful emotions i believe that emotions might have been even more powerful in the cinema in 2021 than they are now on tv    however as for the story itself as someone who has not read the books it was too drawn out and slow to watch the most exciting part of the over twohour film was the last 15 minutes it does however give hope that the second part will be more interesting and with more action perhaps after watching the second part i will understand why the first part was portrayed rather slowly    nothing bad can be said about the acting stellan skarsgård as baron vladimir harkonnen was an extremely believable and interesting character he conveyed the serious side that skarsgård has managed to do in the chernobyl series for example but in addition there was a deeper mystery to this film that made you believe that this was an individual with maniacal tendencies
Mar 19 2024,positive,a fantastic rendition on the first half of the dune book and beautifully shot and acted too
Mar 19 2024,positive,one of my favorite movies of all time a great movie with a great cast
Mar 18 2024,negative,very nice story but very slow and boring to watch
Mar 18 2024,positive,interesting story if you look into it a little beforehand very nice pictures and good characters even if a little sterile in places
Mar 18 2024,positive,the force armor and welding way was off see the original instead
Mar 17 2024,positive,watched first 20 minutes when it came out and stopped because i thought it was terrible i couldnt be more wrong about this movie its starts slow but wow did the end get way better great movie 
Mar 17 2024,positive,the intricate worldbuilding stunning visuals and gripping storyline left me in awe
Mar 17 2024,positive,this movie was a masterpiece i loved the cgi and scifi it was so awesome experiencing it at home tim did so good i havent seen number 2 but i will totally watch it soon
Mar 17 2024,negative,audio mixing was truly awful why must we crank speakers to 100 to hear speech and then have our ears blown out when a ship flies in
Mar 17 2024,negative,a lot of flair but no heart    male lead is mediocre
Mar 17 2024,positive,great movie timotheee chalamet was great and the effects were amazing
Mar 17 2024,positive,first the good things about the movie i really love the worldbuilding and the atmosphiere it really acompilshed it but whit this movie there are some flaws first of all the main character it looks like it happend nothing whit this character no learn from mistakes or any development of it it was compleatly blank and secondly the movie quiet missed the goals for the story well at the middle and the end just finaly found what the goal is going to be and even soo it havent reached it soo i have some hopes that the goal will be more specific and i guesss it will reach it
Mar 17 2024,positive,dune is phenomenal it is a visual and audible treat that demands a full movie experience of imax or at least an impressive screen and surround sound in the home     villeneuve teaches a masterclass in visual storytelling  letting the images on the screen tell the story leaving heavy exposition to the side for something as lore heavy as the dune universe its a bold choice yet it works brilliantly the story being played out beautifully with all of its intricacies    other adaptations could take notes books have to use words films do not     one final note  this film ends on a cliffhanger but even then villeneuve has managed to make it an end that would have stood should he not have got a sequel there is much to learn from this adaptation  one can only hope the media giants learn the right lessons
Mar 17 2024,positive,late to the party  had been a fan of the original book and somewhat let down by the original film  as is often the case film adaptations dont meet the high expectations of the fan reader  however a love of timothee chalamets work since call me by your name and yes even in wonka had me weakened to planning to go see dune 2  but thanks to good marketing a new run of dune pushed me into the theatre to see chalamets first outing  perfect kept very true to the book and timothee was a perfect fit as paul atreides  if like me you missed this first time around see it ahead of the sequel
Mar 17 2024,positive,it was alright i liked the david lynch version better this version was slow and really didnt get into it as well as lynch even though lynch strayed from the novel more  i think it spent too much time and effort in being inclusive the acting in lynchs version was far superior with the amount of wellseasoned actors it had  the acting in this version made the characters feel hollow and you really couldnt get invested in them
Mar 17 2024,positive,my history with dune is that i read the books a long time ago watched dune 1984 several times and also enjoyed the 2000 miniseries especially the children of dune sequel  my primary feeling after finishing dune 2023 is id like to go back to any of those  i dont quite understand how dune 2023 managed to be so long with so little actually happening and i also doubt how much i would have understood it without subconsciously filling in the story details i knew from other sources  i was especially disappointed by the absence of any meaningful screentime for the spacing guild and any demonstration of how they use spice for space travel  i feel like this would have been better served as a single 3 hour movie  hopefully part 2 will pay off but even that would leave part 1 just feeling like a labored introduction
Mar 17 2024,positive,the movie is genius but i will say when i see a science fiction movie i see more action this does not pass the test but the movie overall is amazingly done
Mar 16 2024,positive,the foundations of this epic story echo the same grand feeling found in fellowship of the ring
Mar 16 2024,positive,really great movie if you like the genre
Mar 16 2024,negative,bagpipes whispering and just all round confusing situations a story nobody can follow
Mar 16 2024,positive,villeneuve folds spacetime and youre 25000 years in the future for 3 hours in a different galaxy  enjoy the ride
Mar 16 2024,positive,what i needed to see check what i needed to hear check how the talents emotionally affected me check how well i appreciated the little details check how the music made me feel check near perfect
Mar 16 2024,positive,a great film i wait the next episode
Mar 16 2024,positive,it a good start to the dune series and some action scenes just takes its time to get going
Mar 16 2024,positive,a thrilling incredibly cinematic experience and a beautifully done adaptation of the first half of the original dune novel by frank herbert the visuals and story feel immensely grand in scale while being paired with an emotional and powerful musical score by hans zimmer truly captivating in every way and along with part 2 sets a new standard for how scifi films should be made from now on for sure one of my alltime favorite movies
Mar 15 2024,positive,absolutely fantastic one of the best movies of the 21st century the acting was so amazing you could see their thoughts even when it wasnt voiced the characters are so complex and intriguing it doesnt have much action but the action it does have is wonderful
Mar 15 2024,negative,incomprehensible nonsense and ridiculous fight scenes who are the bad guys worst thing  ive seen in years
Mar 15 2024,positive,enjoyable but not as good as the 2000 mini series
Mar 15 2024,positive,its a very slow movie but i enjoyed it great story
Mar 15 2024,positive,this is a beautiful pictured movie    a long beautiful and amazing  journey      warriors that come from one place to help others with war that was amazing to watch    i cant wait to watch dune 2
Mar 14 2024,positive,an amazing adaptation of frank herberts visionary classic awesome in scope and scale this movie makes understanding the complicated plot much simpler
Mar 14 2024,positive,denis villeneuve sets a stage for a scifi epic while not alienating the audience unfamiliar with the source material
Mar 14 2024,positive,great story and executed amazingly the music and setting and cinematography blend in beautifully the pace was a little slow but a unique and action packed story this will go down in history as a classic movie
Mar 13 2024,positive,great movie its better than the first live adaptation of the dune books
Mar 13 2024,positive,with some spectacular storyline but drama build up is quite a disappointment
Mar 13 2024,positive,dune does not disappoint   i liked it  looking forward to part 2
Mar 13 2024,neutral,this movie is tik tok eboy with no muscle mass with other more famous celebrities the movie the guy in the trailer just looks like every single guy on tik tok singing without singing all in all its a good movie  but its not better than the old dune i prefer that one far more
Mar 13 2024,negative,sound is amazing there isnt much too look at if you like grey  grainy footage this may be for you does it follow the book no it doesnt even try it only gets worse in part ii
Mar 12 2024,positive,amazing film didnt see it in the theater unfortunately but its still a great film own the dvd and i watched it almost everyday and i love it
Mar 12 2024,positive,its a really good movie and an excellent adaptation of the book
Mar 12 2024,positive,a decent attempt hurt by an agonizingly slow place deliberately intended to stretch the film into multiple installments and missing the delicious weirdness of the original and unfairly derided original  required viewing for any hope of understanding this film splitting the film into two pieces was sold as allowing the filmmaker to tell the complete story but instead we get filler of long exterior scenes conversations with little meaning to the plot and hints at ideas still come later in another film but lacking any payoff within this installment in the end we are treated to an expensive film at a fine french restaurant leaving hungry and wondering if we should bother returning
Mar 12 2024,positive,very good film can feel slow at times but it has a lot of worldbuilding to do
Mar 12 2024,positive,its so obvious that everyone involved is doing their best and every technical aspect goes crazy hard on all fronts which helps carry a very comlicated story and makes it work i feel like this is going to age like wine
Mar 12 2024,positive,the film dune 2 practically begins where the first one ended therefore before watching the second part its worth refreshing our memory with dune 1    the creators of the film tried to stay as faithful to the original material as possible but due to the limitations of the cinematic format they had to omit some important parts of the book and even certain characters we will only see jessica and leto atreides daughter as an embryo in her mothers womb consequently we wont witness the crucial conversation between alia the baron and the emperor additionally the mentat hawat is absent in the second part and piter de vries makes only a brief appearance the time span from duke leto atreides death to the final scene in the book has also been shortened while in the novel it spans 45 years in the film its less than 9 months its unlikely that such a short period could transform a 17yearold boy into a leader of rebels  the screenplays shortcomings are fully compensated by the cinematography and artistic techniques each frame is a professional work of art the wide shots of house harkonnens military might the architecture of arrakis the eightlegged military vehicles desert landscapes and the fremen riding on sandwormsall unfold on the screen accompanied by hans zimmers hypnotic music  expressive techniques were also generously employed to enhance the visual context feydrauthas battle with the captive warriors of house atreides the cannibals the intimate scene in lady de vries chamber and more its precisely these nonverbal visual techniques that make viewers appreciate villeneuves films    the characters in denis villeneuves film dune have been meticulously crafted with attention to detail and aesthetics even when it comes to the most unpleasant portrayals viewers dont need to search for hidden meanings behind the characters because the visual component makes them highly comprehensible  regarding the acting we havent seen anything fundamentally new compared to dune 1 however there are some notable aspects worth mentioning     director villeneuve gave paul atreides less than 9 months for his transformation into muaddib did timothée chalamet manage this quantum leap in the final part of the film chalamet carries the emotional weight of almost all scenes while other characters including jessica and stilgar take a backseat serving as the backdrop for muaddib whether the actor justified the directors trust is not a straightforward answer paul atreidess internal ambivalence as a character is complexon one hand theres contradiction vision reflection and doubt on the other hand theres determination responsibility and firmness perhaps due to the limited time convincing execution of challenging scenes fell short the directors mistake is that muaddib may be the messiah but not the executioner  whether the actor had real chances for success with such a complex task remains an open question    in dune 1 baron vladimir harkonnen was the primary antagonist but in dune 2 we witness the rivalry between uncle and nephew which turns into a true acting battle stellan skarsgård although performing his role well ultimately takes a backseat  lowset eyes on a pale cold face and the black palate of a halfopen mouth with plump almost childlike lips magnetically draw attention austin butler kept the focus of the audience on his character with a kind of cheeky ease while timothee chalamet went crazy with who he now has to show people paul atreides muaddib usul kwisatz haderach lisan algaib butler doesnt have a lot of experience as a leading actor in box office films the main role of elvis presley is rather an exception however feydrautha provides the best acting contribution in the second part of dune its one of those cases where you want to witness character development but the script doesnt afford that opportunity    the film also sheds light on important contemporary themes through the events unfolding on arrakis its not entirely clear whether denis villeneuve intended to draw parallels with the present day or if its merely his interpretation of the original books text    dune 2 vividly portrays the struggle against a cruel aggressor who plays the role of a colonizer and a sadistic killer the good old simple solutions involving artillery against the peaceful population of siach tabr to suppress resistance serve as a poignant example the film also emphasizes the significance of possessing nuclear weapons while climate change concerns take a backseat   among the fremen theres no unified survival strategy and the choice between fighting and fleeing sparks heated debates resisting the aggressor could lead to a prolonged and bloody galactic war ownership of a valuable resource keeps the fremen at the center of political battles    the fairskinned aristocrat paul atreides attempts to find common ground with the fremen despite his bold actions he doesnt escape mockery from the native inhabitants of arrakis paul becomes a messiah for the fremen due to their fanatical belief in religious prophecies but was it truly his desire and are the fremen ready to follow their lisan algaib beyond the boundaries of arrakis  the final scene of the power struggle in dune 2 reveals that the messiah on the throne transforms into a politician did his followers understand this perhaps the answers lie in the third installment of the saga    in denis villeneuves film princess irulan possesses ambitions and motivations unlike her portrayal in the original book this adds intrigue to the anticipation of dune 3 additionally viewers catch a glimpse of pauls sister alia  in frank herberts novel chani is presented within the framework of a patriarchal world but villeneuve pushes her beyond those limits chani in the film is independent and selfassured refusing to be first among equals the films conclusion appears more vivid than in the book thanks to sharp contradictions and conflicts among the characters which piques interest for the future sequel    overall dune 2 has set the stage for an epic cinematic saga that science fiction enthusiasts have long awaited
Mar 12 2024,positive,it serves its purpose as a foundation for a sequel and it serves it well with breathtaking visuals and cinematography villeneuves ambitious worldbuilding paves the way for something bigger in the later installments understandably juggling a hefty storyline and its huge ensemble of characters is no easy task though you might be expecting to see more being done with them
Mar 12 2024,negative,a dull tedious and inconsistent film the modern day bores idea of a good time the best acting performance was that of a gigantic sand worm
Mar 12 2024,positive,incredible cinematography amazing cast for a first time watcher it was quite confusing but i would think after watching it a few times more it will get better
Mar 12 2024,neutral,its the type of movie you replay to help fall asleep too long and monotonous
Mar 12 2024,positive,felt engaged all throughout  a hard feat for some movies with longer runtimes
Mar 11 2024,positive,a long time ago david lynch directed dune which of course you know i havent seen it from what i found out today is that its a box office bomb back in the day unfortunately a remake of this epic space opera has came to our faces only in two parts along with the third one which is in development later on with the director of prisoners sicario arrival and blade runner 2049 the movie itself has received praise from fans who think this is a better film all around and now with its sequel on the other hand part two has gotten even better than ever reaching up to the lord of the rings trilogy the dark knight the godfather part 1 2 the shawshank redemption schindlers list and pulp fiction just to name a few with this however its got a huge amount of actors and actresses involved one of which you will recognise in the distant future duke leto atreides ruler of the planet caladan is assigned by the padishah emperor shaddam iv to replace baron vladimir harkonnen as the fiefholder of arrakis a harsh desert planet and sole source of spice a valuable psychotropic substance that imparts heightened vitality and awareness lady jessica is an acolyte of the bene gesserit an exclusive sisterhood whose members possess advanced physical and mental abilities as part of their centurieslong breeding program they instructed her to bear a daughter whose son would become the kwisatz haderach a bene gesserit and messianic superbeing with the clairvoyance necessary to guide humanity to a better future she disobeyed and bore a son paul who is trained by letos aides duncan idaho gurney halleck the suk doctor wellington yueh and the mentat thufir hawat jessica teaches him bene gesserit disciplines paul confides in jessica and duncan of his troubling visions of the future with the sequel of part 2 been in cinemas recently i decided to watch the first part of dune and that caught me by surprise in the fair tie and ive watched this twice now i watched it last night while i was drinking my beer and now on my second watch that had me preparing myself to review it and give my full thoughts on what i think of it and give it a much bigger praise just like others do with it with pennywise done the same thing with the part 1  2 dune will have the opportunity to do so along with the others years ago when paul and lady jessica are being chased by a strange giant worm with its gigantic mouth with no eyes that had me saying what the hell was that and paul just answered its a thumper with it being similar to star wars the lord of the rings and harry potter dune is the best achievement to get scifi fans and movie fans infested in the journeys with fantastic visual effects marvelous cinematography great story and immense music by hans zimmer despite not sounding exactly like those powerful ones he did in the past now with that film being done stay tuned for part 2 in the near future i still havent seen the original version by david lynch but what the hell the remake is much better in part 1 to be exact definitely worth it for six oscars now with zendaya said it best this is only the beginning
Mar 11 2024,positive,a refreshing onetime experience after so many years of marvel dominated cinema dune is slower paced artistic and focused on visual storytelling which i didnt know i was absolutely craving for all these years
Mar 11 2024,positive,really loved this movie not my usual genre to rush and see really exceeded expectations have not seen a sweeping epic of this magnitude in many many years it had moments of such intricate focus alongside those gorgeous visual scenes   no easy feat made true stars out of timothee chalamet  and zendaya in an already stellar cast stunning piercing perfectly restrained in moments and wonderfully epic in others amongst the bursting overflow of marvel movies and hollywood blockbusters thrown out at an alarming rate these days this sets the bar completely in a league of its own it sets the bar for all blockbusters that will follow amazing
Mar 11 2024,positive,one of my favorite movies worldbuilding fantastic visuals and music character development that youre invested in plus loyally honoring the dune books could watch over and over and still appreciate
Mar 11 2024,positive,dune is a big set film with plenty of stars including rebecca ferguson star timothy chameleon but its oscar isaac who gives the number one performance my only complaint was there needed to be less big sounding music
Mar 11 2024,negative,it was like 3 hour montage of crescendos but with no plot or character development to give any context or meaning to the overthetopness of it all  couldnt bring myself to care about any of the characters
Mar 11 2024,positive,awesome movie denis villeneuve really has a great vision
Mar 11 2024,positive,great movie watched it twice
Mar 10 2024,negative,lynchs version is better this one is all style and no substance and the acting is subpar
Mar 10 2024,positive,another masterpiece by denis
Mar 10 2024,positive,it was amazing as of the cgi and the production allthough it was boring at a lot of points in the film so thats why it is not a 5 star film
Mar 10 2024,positive,good first movie to start franchise
Mar 10 2024,positive,in preparation for seeing part 2 tomorrow i rewatched 2021s dune part 1 on max i wasnt a huge fan of it the first time i saw it when it came out i thought a second viewing could improve it and get me prepared for the second one    there are positives and negatives on the positive side there is some good action the two standouts though have to do with the presentation this movie looks amazing in terms of both special effects and the settings also the score is amazing it immerses you in the movie    unfortunately there are also some negatives first they throw so much information at you that it is hard to keep track of it all as a result the story is not as strong as it could be also the performances were not good in my opinion i havent seen wonka yet but as of right now i am sold on timothee chalamet as a leading man i didnt think anyone stood out every performance was average     this ended up being an above average movie for me both watches i wanted to like it more and it didnt have that spark
Mar 10 2024,positive,visually stunning fantastic acting and supreme direction from villeneuve
Mar 10 2024,positive,visually stunning with good acting
Mar 10 2024,positive,dune expertly captures themes of legacy power destiny fate and more against fantastical set pieces staying true to the complexity of the challenging novel it adapts
Mar 10 2024,negative,very bland and boring the movie was overstretched and drawn out i could sum this movie up in one paragraph with majority of it being a man takes a walk in a desert with ambien music playing in the background a nap would be more exciting i wouldnt waste my time with this one at all
Mar 10 2024,positive,great world building very effective use of sound design as well
Mar 10 2024,negative,utterly forgettable the reviews clearly demonstrate just how far movies have dropped in quality its like anything that isnt awful gets high numbers this movie fails in every way a movie can fail despite the visuals its in the class of a tv movie reviewers should show a little backbone and stop rating based on which movie is the least pathetic
Mar 10 2024,positive,denis villeneuve is crafting the greatest scifi epic of our time  everything about it is so immersive and real feeling
Mar 10 2024,positive,one of the best sf movie i ever seen
Mar 9 2024,positive,its not on par with the sequel however its still a visually fascinating and supremely acted film that opens a vast world of unknowns for viewers unfamiliar with the herbert catalog
Mar 9 2024,negative,yawn fest style over substance
Mar 9 2024,positive,really awesome cant say anything bad though i would like a bit different color scheme desert feels too dark at times
Mar 9 2024,positive,i had trouble understanding some of the dialogue but other than that everything was enjoyable except for timothée chalamets hair lol
Mar 9 2024,negative,the movie quite frankly was boring chalamete was too weak of an actor for the role to be believable
Mar 9 2024,positive,after the disappointment with star wars which increasingly adopted bright coloring and had an excessive use of colors in its cinematography dune is a fitting portrayal for a scifi film
Mar 9 2024,positive,its too underrated
Mar 8 2024,positive,i really enjoy dune as someone who has read the book oscar issac is great fitting the role of duke leto the cinematography is great and the knife duels are well choreographed i love timothee chalemet as an actor and i can say this is one of the best movies he is in overall a great adaptation to the first part of the novel
Mar 8 2024,positive,this is definitely a must see movie the only thing that could be different is that the beginning was little bit boring but the rest is awesome
Mar 8 2024,positive,great movie pretty accurate to the source material exept the inner dialogue which is hard to do anyway without having voiceover loved it bought it definitely will be a yearly rewatch
Mar 8 2024,positive,just absolutely wonderful moviestoryslow pace characters  actors and their soul to moviejust absolutely great movie
Mar 8 2024,positive,after watching the first one  i believe reading the books would be insightful a very fun movie with great world building great performances all around they should of had feyd faiths on screen more but he was a great villain truly evil
Mar 8 2024,positive,i love when sciencefiction can rise above the standards and be a true work of art villeneuve is no stranger to making epic scifi films with very human stories and he pulls out all the tricks with his amazing adaptation made to be witnessed on the big screen with its breathtaking camerawork and visual effects plus sound and music that will truly shake your core and make you feel immersed perfectly casted even though the end of the first part seems abrupt you will be nothing but excited for part two
Mar 8 2024,positive,eye candy does not a great movie make villeneuve is trying to punch above his weight but the movie lacks the sheer brilliance and intellectual depth of a work like 2001 a space odyssey dune is a good attempt but the overbearing music and wooden acting takes its toll the film is too long with a very ponderous first half
Mar 8 2024,positive,absolute masterpiece if you have the chance to see it in imax make yourself a favor and live that once in a lifetime opportunity its a 2h46 incredibly well spent
Mar 8 2024,positive,one of my favourite movies ever incredible soundtrack amazing acting almost perfect cgi bar a single shot and some of the best worldbuilding ever im glad denis paced the films so that the worldbuilding could shine and the later parts of the novel had room to breathe in an epic sequel
Mar 8 2024,positive,definitely lived up to the hype  great movie
Mar 8 2024,positive,was a great movie with an awesome world building aspect
Mar 8 2024,positive,not trying to age myself but i did see the first film in the 80s now that i have seen the two remade films i find them to be far superior and i cant wait for a part 3 the messiah well i will have to wait probably 3 years away 
Mar 8 2024,positive,it wouldve been so much better if the pacing wasnt all over the place due to visions of the protagonist
Mar 7 2024,positive,what an introduction to the super complicated densley rich scifi book of dune the cinematography was incredible and totally epic a benchmark many films will have to try to live up to it   villeneuve has mostly followed the book and some of the action scenes were even better than i imagined   what a film this is the dune i have been waiting for over 35 years
Mar 7 2024,positive,lengthy scifi book adaptation sometimes struggles to deliver the necessary punch its dialogue and plot offers but for the most part this is a wonderfully executed entertaining and visually captivating experience
Mar 7 2024,positive,about as good as it gets for me i was totally engrossed in this movie
Mar 7 2024,positive,excellent version of frank herberts epic scifi classic set in the sands of outer spacehence the titleyoung paul atreides is caught in the cross hairs of a multiplanetary war between all the houses of mankindbattling over dominion of the spices the melange which enable man to be omnipotent omniscient and nearly immortal so he struggles with all of that all the while he feels the pull of destiny as the new chosen messiah the lisan al gaib the big difference between this and the original david lynch film has is that this makes sense and it has an epic sweep and budget that the scifi channel miniseries from 2000 just cant compete withboth timothy chalamet and director denis villanueva do the story justice giving it the gravitas and sweep this epic deserves  overall highly recommended    ps george lucas has admitted star wars was heavily influenced by dune and its easy to see that here
Mar 7 2024,positive,one of my favourite films ever just slightly better that part 2 in my opinion
Mar 7 2024,positive,i am not familiar with the novel and hence my review is entirely solely of the movie i find its actually a great watch characters are great story is broad i love the introduction of characters and character development i just wish that some characters did not die like how they did all in all a great watch im excited for part 2 and im thinking of reading the novel because of these movies the story is very interesting
Mar 7 2024,negative,the first part was so slow and boring
Mar 7 2024,positive,slow burn and kinda have boring parts but then the world building was superb with timothee giving his best in here
Mar 7 2024,positive,an absolute amazing performance 
Mar 7 2024,positive,the action is a bit slow but i was not bored at all love this movie
Mar 7 2024,positive,this movie is a slow burn and would totally understand the scale of the world building dull but its ultimately the downpayment for a big pay off in the subsequent movies the small details in the film i find just hypnotizing
Mar 7 2024,negative,this film is a waste of almost three hours of your life its so slow and boring it stretches out half a book and an hour and 30 minutesmax of plot into almost three hours it has stupid cliches and the acting from some of the castmostly the main character is awful he barely ever emotes all the dialogue is whispered too and i had to ask my brother who had read the book what and why things were going on half the time i also wanted to see more of the space worms they were barely even on screen overall boring too long and bad acting also it definitely feels unnecessary that they cut the book into two films this makes them stretch everything out and the movie doesnt have a clean climax just a kind of lame fight also none of the characters are really likeable again it doesnt help that the main guy doesnt emote at all i didnt feel anything for his character at all save yourself three hours and do something else
Mar 7 2024,positive,very good movie i really loved it
Mar 7 2024,positive,dune was a good although i didnt get the plot of the movie i was still a good movie but i was confusing but it is better than the original movie
Mar 7 2024,positive,this movie burns very slow for a very long time i feel asleep a few times the first time i saw it i paid more attention the second time around i dig it i felt this movie didnt need to be this long to get to the point i hope the sequel picks up the pace
Mar 6 2024,positive,not bad a very beautiful film to watch and the story is just getting started but its a snooze fest however its building up to part 2
Mar 6 2024,positive,the beginning of the movie was cool and interesting i like the way bene  is the narrator in the beginning timothee chalamets paul atreides is a cool character the setting of the movie is cool reminded me of star wars  episode 1the phantom menace dave bautistas glossu rabban harkonnen is a villain of the movie oscar isaacs duke leto atreides is a very good character the action and the fighting scenes of the movie are awesome i like the way that paul had visions about zendayas character chani the visual effects are awesome everything in this movie is perfection
Mar 6 2024,positive,i love the custome in the movie it make my feel like they always go to the fashion week show i really like paul and the lady characters its feel like they would do everything for their family their people the theme music  the image in the movie are absolutely gorgeous the content of the movie is great
Mar 6 2024,negative,this movie was very very boring and too long it couldve been summed up in 30 minutes but yet they drug it out and made it painfully boring to sit through and watch till the end shouldve just left the og movie alone they honestly dont even need a second movie because that one will be boring as hell too
Mar 6 2024,positive,ive gotta admit that this movie went way above my expectations this movie is one of the best i have ever seen the story leading up to the sequel was compelling by adding a lot of character development and sporting topoftheline visual effects the latter impressing me the most the pacing felt a bit off at times hence the 4andahalf star rating but eventually picks itself up as the movie goes on but it does take a while the performances were insane as well timothee chalamet had a standout performance in my opinion especially as we get further and further into the movie and when the movie hits it hits hard particularly in the feels with its outstanding emotional weight    this movie is a definite mustwatch and once youre done with this movie youll be ready to go for the sequel  which i plan to see soon
Mar 6 2024,positive,amazing film with fantastic pace and cinematography well worth the trip to the cinema
Mar 6 2024,positive,more time i watch this movie more i love it went to see rerelase in imax the other day and damn its good perfect after watching part 2 yesterday
Mar 6 2024,positive,a beautiful adaptation by the director to frank heberts book
Mar 6 2024,positive,great epic movie sometimes a slow burner but worth every second
Mar 6 2024,positive,i thought that the movie started a little snow but after 30 minutes i was hooked
Mar 6 2024,negative,omg this movie was horrible the story seems to move slowly for no reason other than to make two movies out of one story if you are thinking about seeing a movie pass on this one
Mar 6 2024,positive,absolutely phenomenal film i was hooked from the beginning i didnt want it to end and i cannot wait to see the second part to this series i hope to see more to come timothee chalamet is a wonderful actor and absolutely perfect for this role
Mar 5 2024,positive,one of my favorite scifi movies it feels really fresh story is well done actors are great and it managed to build some sort of tension for me where im constantly engaged in it
Mar 5 2024,positive,great loved it good pacing acting story has it all
Mar 5 2024,positive,what a show a must watch
Mar 5 2024,positive,denis villenueves dune part 1 is a beautifully shot scifi epic that sets the groundwork for part 2 the acting from chalemet is great and the relationship of his character with his father and friends is very well written hans zimmers score is epic and really immerses the audience in the experience the only minor issue the film has is it lacks a bit of flow at times but overall a great setup film if you can see it on the big screen see it
Mar 5 2024,positive,i would rate it a 5 if i had a better understanding of the source material or if i were more of a dune geek its great
Mar 5 2024,positive,it was okay but honestly i dont get why everyone loves it so much too long acting is sub par not the best but decent only because of the directing
Mar 5 2024,positive,watched it 7x before part 2
Mar 5 2024,positive,the best movie of all timeas simple as that
Mar 5 2024,positive,i havent enjoyed a movie this much in years the acting settings and special effects were phenomenal drawing the audience into the world that is arrakis
Mar 5 2024,positive,a clear story brought to the screen dune 2 was cut in the right place to make way for dune 3 fantastic visuals so superior to dune 84 my favorite in 24 so far
Mar 5 2024,positive,76 felt kind of like star wars and mad max combined more like star was with all of the different civilizations on different planets the spice is a very coveted resource that allows them to space travel too abstract for my liking was good but kind of slow and felt really like just build up for part 2 25 on rewatch
Mar 4 2024,positive,slow but enjoyable movie i gave it a higher rating because i get to see part 2 tomorrow and dont have to wait feels exciting to see the continuation of the story
Mar 4 2024,positive,one of the best movies from this year so far visual is a explosion of sensations  super well done its long but its totally worth it action and more action in every scene love it dune part 3 coming soon
Mar 4 2024,positive,grandiose adaptation of a very complex writing though missing key elements from the first book the films dune 1 and 2 makes up for in presence on its own the series would make a great scifi yarn but coupled to the book it does pale in some ways the extrapolation of the fundamentalist vs the secular view of religion from the ideas originally place by the religious sisterhood on arrakis does seem to be very contemporary nothing of that nature in the book as i recall
Mar 4 2024,positive,really good ive not seen other dune film and i didnt know about the existence of it before this film and its good  mabe too long for me but it was something really good compared of what we currently have
Mar 4 2024,positive,amazing astonishing a sight to behold
Mar 4 2024,positive,after refreshing myself after 2 years of the film i can say that i can comment better on the film the landscapes are definitely a plus but the plot is sometimes uninteresting but i can still say its one of the better scifi movies
Mar 4 2024,positive,pretty good but can be boring at times and slow paced but thrilling overall
Mar 4 2024,positive,absolutely loved the film the screenplay removed whatever was unnecessary for the screen and everything works brilliantly and denise got to tell the story he wanted to tell somethings couldve been stretched in the final act but nothing that keeps it from being a great movie ignore the contrarians and just see it for yourself
Mar 4 2024,positive,great second half of the first book visually stunning did not care for the deviation of the original plot from the book  always annoying when hollywood deviates from a very successful book that does not need changes  lets hope they make dune messiah
Mar 4 2024,positive,although the plot moseys long slowly its the perfect place to convey a thoughtful and profound story
Mar 4 2024,negative,boring weak storie characters without deepness
Mar 4 2024,positive,hollywood pay attention this is how you do it right great pacing stunning visuals amazing sound  but above all good writing and good directing characters feel authentic in their world and were allowed to linger in scenes to get a sense of that world well done
Mar 4 2024,positive,best film of the year if i had more money i would go back and watch it everyday
Mar 4 2024,positive,this movie is absolutely gorgeous and the worldbuilding is great the characters are complex and the story is good however the incredibly dense worldbuilding leads to a distracting amount of exposition dumps that dont always feel natural the same flaw exists with the characters theyre complex but they dont get a chance to develop many of them much because so much time is taken establishing the rules of the universe i feel like this could have been done better but with an already 3 hour runtime there simply isnt time i would have preferred this movie as a 5 or 6 episode tv limited series with more time given to flesh out the characters and to space out exposition but this is probably as good as you could do with a single film all in all the movie was pretty great and i hope that part 2 uses the fact that most of the rules are already established to develop the story and characters more
Mar 4 2024,positive,dune part 2 is a cinematic triumph blending stunning visuals captivating performances and a haunting score into a mesmerizing journey through the world of arrakis director denis villeneuves meticulous pacing keeps every minute essential while timothée chalamet leads a stellar cast in bringing frank herberts characters to life with its grandeur and emotional depth dune part 2 is an unforgettable epic
Mar 4 2024,positive,this is a great movie no doubt everything down to the acting soundtrack lore cinematography was all jaw dropping it is a great watch and hell of a ride
Mar 4 2024,positive,i loved it the world building the music score best of all time the brutalism the acting the epic scale the action and above everything else the athmosphere this is how its done this is science fiction for adults an absolutely masterpiece i had no problem with the ending not more than i had with the fellowship of the ring ending when you know its the first part of a series
Mar 4 2024,positive,loved it it combines farfuture sciif with mysticism and it does it so beautifully my favorite type of movie by far
Mar 4 2024,positive,some of the critics who pan dune 2 dont like large special effects films  or they dont really like the novel if you like the novel and the story it unwinds then you will enjoy dune 2 because it absolutely captures the letter and spirit of the book if you didnt like the novel  you wont like the film i loved this film i dont know how you make dune into a film without large scale special effects  some critics said it was boring thats what they said about 2001 too but villanueves direction is admirable he uses epic battle scenes and mixes them with small scale human interaction think of spartacus as an example this film  as does the novel creates many levels of personal and philosophic thought it speaks to cultism and the many religions that have searched for their messiahs throughout the ages is paul atrades a real coming of the one or is he just a royal who has become aware of himself as a leader the intricate intrigue between harkaans and the atrades and the many betrayals and hatreds  within and between families this all done with significant style and pace by villanueve  it is masterpiece of science fiction and art and could not recommend it highly enough to those who love  great film making
Mar 4 2024,positive,the soundtrack visuals acting and story are firing on all cylinders the story is a little tough to follow at first but gets better and better with every rewatch this is definitely peak sci fi storytelling
Mar 4 2024,positive,while the acting dialogue and pacing of this movie are all exceptional what really sets it apart are the spectacular visuals that somehow bring the worlds of caladan and arrakis to life it is held back from being a 5star film as it ends midway through the story but if dune part two sticks the landing then this will become an all time classic scifi series
Mar 4 2024,negative,zzzzzzzzz in a word boring   with a cast like that its is shameful for the movie to be this bad  i dont know why they even bother saying zendeya is in the movie you will see what i mean   i was so excited to see this movie because i wanted to see the sequel in theaters now im not going to bother ill wait
Mar 4 2024,positive,better then the original movie version from long ago
Mar 4 2024,positive,total brilliant delivery
Mar 4 2024,positive,the perfect sequel needed another hour3 was not enuff
Mar 4 2024,neutral,very disappointed a film that was hard to keep up with story wise and therefore was boring
Mar 4 2024,positive,probably the best sciencefiction movie ever  acting cinematography special effects everything was amazing 
Mar 4 2024,positive,was good wish some scenes werent dropped from the book
Mar 4 2024,positive,pretty much a masterpiece the effect and score were unbelievable i could do without them trying to make chani more important of a character than she is and also the casting of the emporer is silly
Mar 3 2024,positive,visually speaking this film is perfect but sometimes there was a feeling that the information and content were thrown around too much perhaps this helped give this film a reputation for being boring
Mar 3 2024,negative,watched with friends we paused it a couple of times and none of us could figure out exactly what was going on i found it hard to care about the characters or their situation felt like a beautiful painting of stale bread very overrated movie
Mar 3 2024,positive,great acting great direction great cinematography this movie is no doubt a classic and the best film so far this year it does move slowly but with purpose like all great films please go see it
Mar 3 2024,positive,the good this visuals are awesome the action is awesome the acting is awesome   the bad its an overused plot rich kid loses everything moves in with the poor falls in love with a poor girl uses the poor people to rise up and take his rich life back   yes i recommend this film
Mar 3 2024,positive,superbly acted and very well written it does kinda of feel like a giant flashback and i think they should have cranked up the colour a bit but its a good show fairly close to the novel but still entertaining
Mar 3 2024,positive,phenomenal cinematography flawless visual effects and decent performances help make up for an attimes expositionheavy script delivering a wonderful new piece of scifi that will only improve with time and more story to tell in the sequel
Mar 3 2024,positive,very sandy and cool but why was the mom always whispering
Mar 3 2024,neutral,just like the david lynch version wooden acting good looking actors less confusing and more faithful to the book who thought zendaya can act she looks beautiful but she cant act a disney mannequin
Mar 3 2024,positive,the special effects are so subtle you dont even notice them after a while  combined with very good acting it brings the story to life
Mar 3 2024,positive,this movie was epic the ending shocked me a little
Mar 3 2024,positive,best scifi movie since interstellar near perfect adaptation of the books
Mar 3 2024,positive,i have seen every dune movie or tv show ever created  this is by far the best of all of them  im very excited to see part 2 
Mar 3 2024,positive,this movie was the gateway for me to become a die hard dune fan a visual and auditory treat dune holds a very special place in the hearts of all dune fans
Mar 3 2024,positive,one of the best scifi movies ever made
Mar 3 2024,positive,timothee chalemet and rebecca fergurson shine in their roles and jason momoa was cool to see the movie can get boring quite a few times and confusing especially zendaya and the dream and everytime i saw dave bautistas character i just saw drax oscar issac had no purpose really and i thought i was gonna watch a masterpiece however it is very visually stunning the action choreography is amazing and im somewhat excited for dune part two also the shields are cool
Mar 3 2024,positive,fantastic and lots of fun visually amazing
Mar 3 2024,positive,really really good  i love how well it respected the original novel denis villeneuve is a truly remarkable director and this gets close to the heights of his masterpiece blade runner 2049
Mar 3 2024,positive,excellent basis and strong foundation for the 2nd part
Mar 3 2024,positive,missed the boat on this one but had to make sure i got it in before my screening of part two what a cool movie man gotta say though i guess its not my favorite of villeneuves but what does that even mean for a director with a filmography like his the visuals here are as striking as ever the cast is electric and the grandeur of it all is just so infectious sure some of the weirdness of herberts novels is just gonna be too difficult to translate regardless of whos bringing it to the screen but there are plenty of wellrealized ideas here to offset the occasional unintended chuckle or two gotta love that score from hans as well the memes already had those vocals stuck in my head before i could even see the movie now ive got no chance of shaking the musical landscape of this film from my head cant wait to see how denis and co are able to close things out in part two
Mar 3 2024,positive,pretty good started slow but the battle scenes were sick
Mar 3 2024,positive,slow and ponderous i was expecting to see the worms but the cinematography kept them in the dark literally part 2 was also dragging but at least i finally get to see those desert beasts got lost in the narration zenya has a funny look batista led unintentionally hilarious antagonists man they need serious anger management
Mar 3 2024,negative,visually a jawdropping moments all throughout the threehour meandering storyline     admittedly i wasnt a fan of technomovies with thinlydisguised patronage of digital studios and fraternity or sorority of aspiring actors at the other end of the queue     cleverly placed symbols of mysticism set amidst dystopian landscape of biblical proportion the movie is more an exercise on selfindulgence on the part of the producers instead of an entertainment it was more like sitting through a threehour episcopalian sermon in a pentecostal service     movies like this arent telling a story they are redefining cinematography they produce we pay to watch nevermind if our bums hurt and minds boggled just sir and enjoy the snacks tell everyone the movie was great why suffer alone
Mar 3 2024,positive,this movie is spectacular a perfect set piece for part 2 and beyond
Mar 3 2024,negative,cinematography without acting or plot total waste of time  one of the only movies i walked out on  what is wrong with reviews  this should not be in the theater
Mar 3 2024,positive,great movie great filmmaking
Mar 3 2024,positive,part 1 was so great that we had to watch it again before heading off to watch part 2 love these movies
Mar 3 2024,negative,the only enjoyment i got out of this was laughing at the name duncan idaho
Mar 3 2024,positive,absolutely stunning masterpiece from beginning to end and such a beautiful continuation of part one i must point out the beauty of the score as well powerful and fitting obviously parts were removed or added from the book but it in no way messed with the integrity or flow go watch
Mar 3 2024,positive,dune was a film that makes sense to anyone who understands the story as it comes from a book with a lot of depth so the film was really very faithful to what was written we had a great script great special effects great photography and good acting
Mar 2 2024,negative,cant help it tried to watch a second time but like the first time i found the movie plain boring lacking any character development and the dialogues are meaningless after half of the movie i just couldnt care for anything that happens
Mar 2 2024,negative,i had to watch this movie five times before i could actually get through the whole thing and not fall asleep could not follow the plot and it really just was passable for me because jason momoa was in it
Mar 2 2024,positive,truly one of most visually stunning films ever made an incredible continuation of the first film with the sound design much improved one of the most successful book adaptations ive seen its remarkable how was able to achieve the feeling of reading the book and give us the images previously only possible in our minds outstanding cast and score cant wait to see again
Mar 2 2024,positive,i didnt watch dune part 1 when it came out and was lucky enough that my local theatervue kerkrade the netherlands was running a marathon of dune part one and two back to back     and let me tell you it was worth it the movies are truly able to captivate the viewer and make them forget that time is actually passing by those 5 and a half hours passed by so quickly it almost felt like only 2 hours the story and characters are well written and the special effects are truly stunning this is a must watch for anyone that even remotely enjoys scifi stories
Mar 2 2024,positive,dune part one is even better in retrospect after viewing the second film its a slowburn highbrow scifi epic with excellent world building and characters but it shares many of the same issues with the second film namely its spiritually dark source material
Mar 2 2024,negative,im not totally convinced this was that much better than lynchs movie i thought the pacing was too fast if i wasnt familiar with the source material going in i think id have been a little lost lynch used narration to explain plot points which probably werent effective but it shows how hard this material is to translate to screen    the pandering to minority females by changing dr kynes character wasnt terribly distracting for me although this stuff usually bothers me      jason momoa was awful he brought a cheesy approach to gurney nowhere near as good as the star trek guy the atreides in my mind are stoic akin to european royalty momoa with his barbarian build and cheesy jokes seems better suited to wwe or whatever his background is hes not a bad actor he just didnt feel like gurney to me     the saving grace in my mind was the cgi or cinematography the visuals were great definitely eye candy but in my opinion the acting and pacing were inferior to lynch and lynchs dune was not a great film but the characters especially the baron  were so memorable while the visuals in this film were better they werent unique though this film looks like all other high budget sci fi films sorry for disjointed review worth a watch but more evidence why dune is a story that just cant be captured in cinema
Mar 2 2024,neutral,this movie is visually stunning and the story gets you hooked however this movie is just a whole lot of set up
Mar 2 2024,positive,abosuletly phenomenal    dune sets the stage for its predecessor dune part two acting as the ignition of a slowtotick bomb    this movie conveyed complex topics from frank herberts novel into simple enjoyable scenes villeneuves clever approach ensuring the audiences satisfaction displays his willingness to perfect this movie denis combined minddazzling visuals and extraordinary sound effects to delight the audience and he succeeded    overall this was a wellwritten movie with an anticipating story undoubtfully denis villeneuves dune is one of many memorable scifi spectacles that introduced itself slowly but courageously into this new universe of spice
Mar 2 2024,negative,not worth the price of admission once you get past the hype dune part 2 is a slow paced boring movie a plot that tries to be great but ends up being redundant
Mar 2 2024,positive,for me a cult one minutes after the end
Mar 2 2024,positive,masterpiece watched it few days ago and can not get it out of my head this is the epitome of cinematography just beyond perfect this is an art truly it is can not wait to watch it again
Mar 2 2024,positive,i thought this latest cinematic version of frank herberts dune was one of those films you need to watch with the sound turned off  not an option in the cinema i agree     this would be especially true if you have read the books since this latest version changes many of the key characters into the opposite of what they are in print to no good effect and generally turns a magnificent novel into a boring film to listen to but wonderful visually imho although this is hardly a unique example of hollywood ruining a great book    not that the books stay great beyond the second in the series imho and i gave up part way into the fourth book which goes beyond silly into utterly ridiculous    if this cinematic series makes it that far people will be talking about it first jumping the shark and then jumping the sandworm jumping the shark 
Mar 2 2024,positive,definitely contemplated 3 or 35 stars because this film was the definition of worldbuilding and as a fan of star wars above all else this just felt a bit too close to the area its quite obvious george lucas drew some inspiration from the novel before creating the first star wars movie yet this film looked and felt too similar to a new hope for my liking but it was visually gorgeous acted extremely well had a powerful score and was brought to life by an amazing director with a clear vision for the filmsi also have never seen rebecca ferguson in anything else before as horrendous and that may be and i must say i am a huge fun cant wait to see part two and im really curious to see if it will live up to the empire strikes back in terms of a sequel like everyone says it does
Mar 2 2024,positive,a solid foundation for whats to come
Mar 2 2024,positive,wonderful film great detail and care went into the making of this film superb acting directing and vision a really great film
Mar 2 2024,positive,2021s dune film is a grand scifi epic that is so ambitious that by the end you will be wanting more of it the cast assembled here are all top notch lead by star timothée chalamet now it probably will have helped to have read the novel but know that is not a requirement to enjoy this film also i was not a fan of the original film back in the 80s as it tried to fit so much story into such a short time with this film by visionary director denis villeneuve they take their time building up the action and the stakes there is a lot of character story here think of game of thrones but in space the action is breathtaking score is mesmerizing acting great and visuals jaw dropping my only complaint from making this perfect is that the movie starts to get a little off balance 23 through also 1520 minutes could have been shaved off with maybe some of those additional scenes to maybe be saved for part ii dune is a wonderful experience to be seen on the biggest screen available dune gets a near perfect 4 12 stars out of 5 from me 
Mar 2 2024,positive,spectacular movie with great character development worth the watch 100
Mar 2 2024,positive,a lot good about the movie writing or editing was a little off or something
Mar 2 2024,negative,one of the slowest and most boring films ive ever seen the audio was so inconsistent it nearly blew my tvs speaker had it on 100 to hear dialogue and 10 for the insanely loud score the shots of the desert were the only good thing in this film it felt like every scene depicted something not physically possible or was just overdone with almost nothing moving the plot the fight scenes were also incredibly lame i just dont understand what people were watching that rated this movie highly
Mar 2 2024,positive,i dont know why but i didnt liked it very much on first viewing despite loving the cinematography i think i found it too depressing then i went watched it again and was very impressed overall it was still depressing but some stories are just like thatand not all stories need to be happy to be good  denis villeneuve is an amazing director for sure    although this is more of a setup for future movies and lacks the action that would elevate it i think theres enough intrigue to make you want to come back to this world even for someone like me who isnt familiar with the books     i cannot wait to watch the second movie and know more about the future of these characters very tempted to look up the full story online but i feel that it would be a disservice to what the filmmaker and everyone accomplished here
Mar 2 2024,positive,a truly original film a modern day start wars in its impact size and seriousness of what its building it makes you take it seriously and i am sure will be spoken about for years after
Mar 1 2024,positive,amazing movie great visuals and an incredible adaptation of the original novel
Mar 1 2024,positive,i loved the movie truly couldnt wait to see part two after being blown away by part one timothee chalamet is amazing here along with the entire cast
Mar 1 2024,positive,an epic masterpiece with impressive pictures and intense gameplay cinema is back
Mar 1 2024,positive,it was absolutely perfect i have read the book many times and the movie did not disappointed me at all cast is espectacular it is a dream to watch my favorite book to come to life well done
Mar 1 2024,positive,i unfortunately didnt get to see this in the theaters upon release but watched on my oled setup 4k uhd disc in my home theater beautiful zimmers musical score was amazing    the bigger screen the better for these films but great adaptation to film looking forward to part 2   im glad its split up in 2 movies as its a large book people who say its boring i dont get that 25 hours went by in flash
Mar 1 2024,positive,although visually impressive the pace of this movie was way too slow it felt bland and one note so bland that i kept disassociating throughout which never happens to me
Mar 1 2024,negative,wtf did i just watch this story does not deserve this production value  it gets more than the minimum because there were some good action sequences and overall it was well done from a technical perspective so it might be good to put on while you bake some cookies
Mar 1 2024,positive,denis villeneuve has been a masterclass director for his most recent movies prisoners the arrival bladerunner 2049 are fantastic movies that conclude with satisfying endings for an all round great watching experience     dune part 1 isnt quite like it its the first part to what i imagine will be a long and deep story the movie feels half baked and what was here didnt seem to match his previous work    the acting goes from excellent to mediocre depending on the actors the score is generic and is mostly forgettable and the vfx at times is masterclass and jarring at others    its hard to judge half a movie when its clear theres a full story not yet told perhaps my views will change with part 2 because although this movie has some great scenes good casting and beautiful visuals i left curious of whats to come but not fulfilled by what ive just seen    if kill bill and across the spiderverse can leave me wanting more this movie should of done aswell
Mar 1 2024,positive,a great introduction to the dune world
Mar 1 2024,positive,i found the movie fascinating absorbing and imaginative the music the scenes and the plot are beautiful to see some of the images are running still in me
Mar 1 2024,positive,i dont think is a bad movie  and its really well done its a good setup but nothing really happens  it is really boring  i hope part ii picks up the slack but my god they didnt need more than 2h of runtime for what thay did 
Mar 1 2024,positive,beautiful beautiful beautiful story telling tick character depth tick cinematography tick sound tick score big tick i was going to give this four and a half stars but couldnt find a reason for the half star deduction i have read reviews of people who really dont like the movie but i can not agree even slightly cant wait for part two
Mar 1 2024,positive,after seeing part two part one is a masterpiece there are plenty of the reviews but dv caught the magic presented in the book i wished the second part was at least half that good and it is half that good nothing more this one is a great introduction to the dune watch this read the book and dont bother with the part two sadly this is dv his opus magnum
Mar 1 2024,positive,visually stunning dynamic story unpredictable action one of the great scifi films of modern cinema
Mar 1 2024,positive,this faster paced continuation was exactly what we needed 1010 would recommend i would even watch it again
Mar 1 2024,positive,this will forever be one of my favorite films witnessing dune changed me
Mar 1 2024,neutral,some of the wide cinematography shots were epic but the film overall was really boring endless sand its like if the first star wars film had stayed on the desert planet of tatooine the whole film that film was so very much about leaving that rock
Mar 1 2024,positive,this was such a great film a cinematic masterpiece with a great cast it is rare that i enjoy remakesrebootsnew adaptions and this is one i think all scifi and dune lovers should see
Mar 1 2024,negative,yet another modern butchery of a classic work it replaces everything meaningful about the characters and story and replaces them with vast sprawling empty spaces just look up images of the desert and save yourself some time
Mar 1 2024,negative,the same arsenal of unremarkable actors strike once again in this half hearted attempt at an adaptation of the dune series
Mar 1 2024,positive,the world building feels extremely slow in the beginning but it is necessary to get the background once the plot hits the movie goes from zero to a thousand and once it starts it doesnt stop what an amazing film this turned out to be cant wait to check out the second film
Feb 29 2024,positive,the sheer scale and depth of worldbuilding at play is incredible the cast is wellselected and provides outstanding performances particularly chalamet and rebecca ferguson one of the purest examples of what science fiction cinema should be
Feb 29 2024,negative,by far and away one of the most overrated films of the past decade poorly written poorly acted and with some of the worst cinematography and design youll ever see they forgot any colours except beige existed and even managed to make the sandworms look boring
Feb 29 2024,positive,this movie is beautiful
Feb 29 2024,positive,very well done  decent characterizations an actual plot that matters more than the explosions  i am familiar with the source material and it is hard to film something like this  the 1984 movie was an interesting if flawed attempt  they maybe had to cut out stuff but anyone who is familiar with the story shouldnt have any issues following this film  maybe the filming was a little drab and they didnt have enough time to really hone in on human emotions but that is the story of dune  maybe if they had a stronger cast the performances might have overpowered the drier story line but i cant really complain about anyone in this film
Feb 29 2024,positive,awesome awesome awesome most best world building ever its a fantastic journey
Feb 29 2024,positive,brilliant  the world is unworthy of this movie and what it gives to a small group of people
Feb 29 2024,negative,just straight up mid the ending just really makes this movie fall flat
Feb 29 2024,positive,epic scale and execution the dolby atmos and 120 4k hdr experience at home is a beast visually stunning and seamless effects beautifully done movie read the books when i was a wee lad and a really nice adaptation looking forward to the sequel
Feb 29 2024,positive,denis villeneuves first scifi epic is a modern triumph though it may be laid thick with complex plotdriven dialogue and its emotions may reside more in the visuals than its characters dune is a true cinematic experience greg fraisers cinematography is staggering hans zimmers score is annoying but fitting not to mention dune contains some of the best sound design in cinema and in my opinion the greatest visual effects you will ever see villeneuve does an incredible job of drawing  you in and immersing yourself into the planet of arrakis brilliantly leading a team of technical masters
Feb 28 2024,positive,overall really really solid film the cinematography and score in this film are top notch personally this film felt really slow and put out a lot stuff for me to garner it took me a while but the idea for this film worked really well very excited to see where this goes in part two
Feb 28 2024,neutral,i had to watch it many times to figure out what was what when i watched the dune 1984 i had some more clarity on what this movie was about but yeah at first it was very hard to understand it
Feb 28 2024,positive,this was a brilliant modern adaptation  the star power is huge the acting topnotch especially rebecca ferguson as the mother  the depth of her emotive expression is inspiring the special effects and worldbuilding awe inspiring
Feb 28 2024,neutral,going to give it another try but didnt quite keep my attention
Feb 28 2024,positive,rewatching ready for part 2 and i found it even more brilliant than the first time   outstanding world and character building   if part 2 builds upon thisit may be the perfect setup for what i hope is an epic trilogy at the very least
Feb 28 2024,positive,i enjoyed it  an interesting and beautiful movie  however it is almost entirely void of humor and the ability to tug on ones emotional senses  sadly there is something forgettable about the whole thing and no draw to rewatch
Feb 28 2024,positive,i love the movie it was action always true timothy charmine is a really good movie love it its great on big screen
Feb 28 2024,negative,absolute snooze fest if they showed this movie to ed norton he would never have met tyler durden
Feb 28 2024,positive,this is a movie that i enjoy but not a movie that i love i want to love is so badly but theres a few gripes for me to not put it into the category of masterpiece ive seen this movie about 5 times now and its a classic for me however my issue is that important elements and key moments are expressed too subtly for such a mammoth blockbuster i wish the moment where house atreides signs to go to arakkis is emphasized more it was too subtle they pretty much signed up for a death sentence but as a viewer im left with wondering why this moment seems important yet its just subtly going by the doctor who removed the shields way too easily it needed to be emphasized more and shouldve been far more difficult to do i wish there was tension shown in his attempt to remove the shields to the point where we feel the impending doom i wanted to feel oh shet its over now but instead i was like what just happened it just happens and as viewers we can easily just miss it because i totally missed it at the first viewing i was like wait thats it thats all it took to remove the shields and for the harkonnens to invade that easily aside from that i enjoyed the movie the world building is very interesting and im super curious to know how it unfolds in dune 2
Feb 28 2024,positive,excellent this wasnt a movie as much as a work of art this is the adaption dune deserves
Feb 28 2024,positive,this movie is one of the best scifi movies of our generation the only flaw i can find about this movie was the trailer not reflecting the movie very well the first time watching this movie i expected to have these huge battle and crazy fights with little plot like our generation is used to like john wick but after watching the movie twice i found how perfect this movie is it really shows and big and small this crazy universe is its like the first star wars movie when the showed tatooine and slightly teased how big and vast how universe is this movie is a perfect setup for the next movie that im very excited for
Feb 27 2024,positive,one of the most epic scifi movies in a very long while a masterpiece in its genre
Feb 27 2024,positive,i like the way director construct the whole ecosystem this is so real to me to accept this new invented world i like the beautiful landscape and all characters in this movie even the sand mouse is described in a deep way respect to the delicate work
Feb 27 2024,positive,adventure drama and awesome characters  successful movie cannot wait for the sequel
Feb 27 2024,positive,simply epic fantastic worldbuilding compelling characters immersive storytelling amazing visual effects
Feb 27 2024,positive,i loved the movie cinematic masterpiece and the sound design incredible performances were amazing i understand people getting bored  but the movie is a built up to whats nextwe should judge it that way and also its not marvel not everything needs to be upto speed it was epic when it needed to be overall amazing first movie cant wait fot the next part itll be a movie that defines the cinema of our times
Feb 27 2024,positive,the best way i can describe and its from someone who has never read the books is that its story will keep you on your seat from start to finish  with the visuals within the world of dune to the characters keep the plot at its pace to its design in every corner for a few minutes will keep you entertained  for the record very little action but thats a little minor until part 2 since this is part 1 being a little more story driven as the book  as a matter of fact this movie alone will make you think you are reading the original book along with picking up a copy and read it even before dune part 2  810
Feb 27 2024,positive,the beauty delivered by the cinematography is mesmerising the production design is flawless and so smart the screenplay delivers exactly what we need to know without any out of the place exposition and the sound is just a masterpiece delivered by the sound mixing team together with hans zimmer score  and if each part is already excelling the sum of the parts adds a boost that is so unprecedented that makes it an amazing world building masterpiece
Feb 27 2024,positive,a true epic mashing the most popular science fiction novel ever with a lawrence of arabia feel
Feb 27 2024,positive,a world building spectacle that will delight fans and newcomers alike denis villeneuves vision of the source material is incredibly detailed and passionately executed
Feb 27 2024,positive,pretty good definitely dragged on a bit though
Feb 27 2024,positive,that  is good stuff
Feb 26 2024,positive,great scifi movie cant wait for part 2
Feb 26 2024,positive,dune is an absolute technical marvel that i cant help but feel is a bit overrated the technical aspects of this film are incredible everything from the cgi to the sound design to hans zimmers score is all perfect and this film deserved every oscar that it got denis villeneuve just brings this world to life with his incredible direction this has a stacked allstar cast that all give fantastic performances whenever the very little action that there is does happen it is brilliantly choreographed this films also has some pretty epic moments like when the space worm shows up or jason momoas awesome fight near the end the reason that i dont really love this like a lot of people do is because im a fan of more traditional storytelling i like a character or plot driven narrative that has a begging middle and end a film that has setup as well as payoff this film is definitely a part one story as its almost entirely setup for a film i likely thought this would be i feel like this could have handled the cliffhanger ending better as it feels like they just picked a random page out of the book and said lets end it here i also felt like the pacing of this was very slow and made parts of the film boring overall this is a brilliantly made film that i felt had more style than substance but i feel like i will like part 2 more
Feb 26 2024,positive,i seriously tried to like this movie because i was a fan of the 1980s flick but it was so long and laborious to watch i enjoy scifi but it was hard to keep interest and i doubt i will watch the second part because i was so bored through the first
Feb 26 2024,positive,this is a good movie but it does not follow the book the book is much better overall this is a good movie oscar isaac was a terrible pick to play duke atreides rebecca ferguson makes up for his disaster performance
Feb 26 2024,positive,it is long drawn out a boring
Feb 26 2024,positive,excellent experience with rerelease on imax theater excited to the next part
Feb 26 2024,positive,best booktofilm adaptation nomination from me as i havent read tolkien with part two out i dont see how you could consider this less than five stars it is not complete on its own and it shouldnt be judged that way
Feb 26 2024,positive,just great all around
Feb 26 2024,positive,a visually stunning movie though heavily reliant on dialogue making prior knowledge of the book or subject matter essential for full appreciation despite this the movie remains captivating and entertaining showcasing a rich and immersive world
Feb 26 2024,positive,marvelous and breathtaking visuals that are literally out of this world what a fantastic contribution to the world of science fiction movies
Feb 26 2024,positive,the best scifi movie i have ever seen
Feb 26 2024,positive,great movie but a bit slow the acting from tim was ok but not great most of the other actors were amazing though ive seen it a few times now
Feb 26 2024,neutral,visually stunning but wooden acting confusing plot almost religious fanatacism whoever said zendaya could act read the books
Feb 25 2024,positive,i wasnt really interested in dune but i was surprisingly impressed by it i watched it three times the visuals were outstanding acting was superb
Feb 25 2024,positive,such a great movie on all fronts
Feb 25 2024,negative,this movie had a lot going for it fantastic sets costumes special effects beautiful music lore however my inability to truly connect with paul and lady jessica is what makes this a 2 stars for me regardless i will still watch dune part 2
Feb 25 2024,positive,a masterpiece in the full sense of the word villeneuves imagining of the classic scifi novel is a vision for the ages
Feb 25 2024,positive,awesome movie with a great soundtrack
Feb 25 2024,positive,perfect movie with perfect casting
Feb 25 2024,positive,dune part one is an amazing science fiction movie it looks incredible the music is powerful and it takes you on a wild ride to a strange desert world called arrakis the world feels real and livedin full of interesting details and strange creatures    the actors are all great especially timothée chalamet as paul a young man with a special future everyone in the movie feels real and you understand why they do what they do  the story is about big families fighting for power and paul getting caught in the middle    the movie does a fantastic job of building the world with lots of cool details but it could have explained a few things about the story a bit better still that doesnt stop it from being awesome    if you like big science fiction adventures with great characters and amazing visuals you need to see dune part one
Feb 25 2024,positive,this movie is so good you can see how much the actors enjoy playing looking forward for the part 2
Feb 25 2024,positive,what can i say that hasnt been already this film is absolute masterclass in the scifi genre i hate to even call it a scifi film because villeneuve has delivered us such a human story that almost feels like a period drama dune exemplifies the show dont tell ethos in filmmaking denis villeneuve created a universe so rich and seemingly plausible that i just want to explore it and immerse myself in it theres it even a criticism to be had its a perfect film  assuming of course that part 2 is equally masterful
Feb 25 2024,positive,dune gives me true scifi vibes i love it cant wait for dune part 2 tomorrow feb 25 i feel part 1 did a great job of building up the story and events it stayed true to part 1 fashion of openended questions and possibilities of lives lost forgotten or alive 5 stars
Feb 25 2024,positive,as a stand alone film it is not good there is so much exposition for the second film that you could really just say that dune part 1 is an almost 3 hour trailer for dune part 2
Feb 24 2024,positive,dune is a cinematic masterpiece that excels in every aspect from its breathtaking visuals that transport you to the mesmerizing desert landscapes to the stellar performances that bring the characters to life every detail is meticulously crafted the epic scale of the story is complemented by a gripping soundtrack creating an immersive experience the adaptation stays true to the source material while adding its own flair making it a standout film dunes brilliance lies not only in its grandeur but in the nuanced storytelling that captivates audiences from start to finish a triumph in filmmaking that deserves all the accolades it receives
Feb 24 2024,positive,it had great cinematography sound effects  and casting of course  never read the novel  but its really interesting
Feb 24 2024,negative,it was really boring wont be watching the sequel
Feb 24 2024,positive,the first time i watched this movie i disliked it it made little sense and the role of the empire was not fleshed out enough to really understand the dynamics of the various social groups i gave it a second chance and really allowed myself to fully immerse in the gorgeous sets colors music  and it all made sense the movie is visually stunning and if you focus on the visual and the screenplay the landscapes lighting sounds music costumes contribute as much to the story as the dialogue it is a stunning movie although i am not convinced that timothee chalamet is this badass ninja  messianic warrior who has come to save their universe especially after his dreadful turn in wonka which really was an embarrassing part for him he doesnt fit the part imo especially when his father played by oscar isaac is such a strong patriarch and leader the selection of chalamet probably has more box office draw reasoning than character match he is too wispy and brooding a indie romancedrama lead more than anything else and i think it was a miscast the same with zendaya  she is terribly miscast in this role since she exudes a childlike quality that doesnt quite match the character it just didnt flow for me  nonetheless hollywood is barely surviving and movie stars are shrinking so this was probably a smart economic choice overall the cast is stellar but the set design music and costumes are really the star of the show
Feb 24 2024,negative,really boring impressive effects and looks good but all style no substance i couldnt watch it all
Feb 24 2024,positive,remember how interstellar made you feel this was a lot like that except i knew exactly what was going to happen  and i know whats coming buckle up biches this is gonna be good
Feb 24 2024,negative,very boring just like any other wb movie not original look every other movie
Feb 24 2024,negative,a pretty typical space war story slow paced and too serious to be much fun but it has some decent effects and performances
Feb 23 2024,positive,the story is ok but the plot is very slowly moving forward i fall sleep two times during the movie run  movie not for everybody
Feb 23 2024,positive,dune part two is a breathtaking sequel that surpasses its predecessor blending aweinspiring visuals profound performances and a deeply emotional narrative denis villeneuve masterfully expands the intricate universe of frank herberts saga offering a visually stunning and philosophically rich cinematic experience timothée chalamet shines as paul atreides supported by an outstanding cast and hans zimmers evocative score creating an immersive experience that balances epic action with intimate character development this film is a testament to the power of storytelling and cinema making it a mustwatch for fans and newcomers alike leaving viewers with lingering thoughts on destiny power and human connection
Feb 23 2024,neutral,pacing issues was not impressed by the execution of the screenplay everything looked terrific but tasted bland not the grand epic science fiction advertised
Feb 23 2024,positive,great story great looks it felt a bit longwinded here and there but not a problem really
Feb 23 2024,positive,didnt feel like 12 of a movie to me this is the total package of an introduction to the dune franchise it more than delivers on the promise of the trailer and i cant wait for part two   a great introduction to the house of atriedies even though i havent read the book this is an amazing screenplay well adapted i was aware some liberties were taken on characters but great performances across the board for dune part one i knew this would  be next best thing
Feb 23 2024,positive,welcome to the world of cinema dune delivers on all fronts simply because it is a visual spectacle filled with juicy lore and one intriguing plotline get ready for a journey of the mind and heart as you see how both sides live
Feb 23 2024,positive,this movie is beautiful the music mesmerizing timothy really did wonderful and the build up of what will be next is very exciting   looking forward to dune part 2
Feb 22 2024,positive,every frame is like a painting
Feb 22 2024,positive,absolutely adore this movie one of my favourites of all time
Feb 22 2024,negative,flat boring  instantly forgettable didnt trigger any emotion in me one good scene though sardaukar planet was nice
Feb 22 2024,positive,a masterpiece of cinema
Feb 22 2024,neutral,the sound design is the only thing that literally won my heart but the story is scattered and the stars are wasted zendaya is a very very bad casting this role was not meant for her    timothee rebecca jason all are kind of seems wasted they have their moments to shine but theyre not enough to keep me invested in the movie all the time    maybe theyre saving cool things for the 2nd part    the visuals are great but tasteless all the time it heavily relies on the music    high hopes from the 2nd part since the first one kinda disappointed me
Feb 22 2024,neutral,dune part 1 was way too long many dragged out unecessary scenes complicated storyline to follow and overall not very entertaining does not make me want to watch part 2
Feb 22 2024,positive,while its protagonist can be a bit bland and it couldve delved deeper into its themes and ideas dune part one is so visually stunning grand and epic in scale in a way few movies are today
Feb 22 2024,positive,this would have been much cooler 2 decades ago
Feb 22 2024,positive,one of the few movies in the last x years id seen again took my 12yearold son to see the rerelease and he loved it a great deal too studios should rerelease prequels a month or so before they release the next movie deadpool and deadpool 2 im looking at you
Feb 21 2024,positive,this is in my opinion the greatest science fiction film ive ever seen
Feb 21 2024,positive,very well made hopefully the sequel improves on the very few flaws
Feb 21 2024,positive,i loved it it is now my second favourite movie after the lord of the rings trilogy
Feb 21 2024,positive,i always laugh at reviewers both critics and audience that complain about a movie being slow think its the instant gratification crowd talking do i have quibbles yes but theyre minor compared to the stunning overall impact this movie has  being able to retain most of the novels complexity as a reference i also read the lord of the rings trilogy and found it relying way too much on cgi for creating character impact overall very boring in many places
Feb 20 2024,positive,it stayed true to the books extremely well which a lot of movies that are based on books struggle with and stayed exciting even with the slow buildup
Feb 20 2024,neutral,not a terrible movie visuals are very good but story in dune part 1 is slow and not much happens   when the movie starts it immediately throw you into stori of dune but nothing will tell you what hapened before the start of the movie thre are some thing said but not much   right after that nothing explaining start the story go on in the middle of the movie nothing much happened except fights some drama with family and some story telling   on the end of the movie you finally start to think you are getting somewhere but when it starts to get interesting it ends   in my wiew whole movie could be squished into an hour and half film yes it is only 155 min but lot of scenes were empty they didnt served any purpose exept visualy good looking scenes   actors were great visuals were also great but i think some of the space scenes were inspired by star wars but that could be becouse both are set in space and there is not much to change   story only part1 255   visuals technical vfx 455  final conclusion mainly considerate the story 255  i hope dune part 2 will be better at story telling
Feb 20 2024,positive,one of my favorite movies also stays true to the book simply amazing
Feb 20 2024,positive,ill start with this the book being adapted here is way to long to be made into a movie without cutting massive amounts of content this movie has nothing on the book however for what it was able to adapt it stayed true to the book and the movie looks and sounds beautiful
Feb 20 2024,positive,this movie is amazingthe cinematography score directing and performances are spectacular the only problem i have with the movie is that it covers only the first half of the book but thats not necessarily a bad thing i believe its the only way to adapt the book into a film however being just the first half the entire narrative serves as a setup for part 2 as a result the pacing can be quite slow at times nevertheless i still consider it a masterpiece of a movie and it sets the stage for the second part
Feb 19 2024,neutral,incredibly slow pace that is slower than reading the book itself despite this slow pace however there are many omissions and poor explanations of important plot points and developement    the acting is freqently spoken in such a mumbled and unsupported voice as has become a modern cinematic stylefor no discernable reason that any sort of passion or emotional depth is completely lost with poor enunciation and pronunciation throughout the film there are very fine actors in the film and the diverse casting is a fresh welcome but the direction given is poor especially causing the films protagonist to fall flat mispronounce important words to the source materials universe and to mumble through most of the film obliterating the text    cinematography is artisticly done but lacks reason or purpose for why it is done so it feels avant garde rather than serving a purpose to compliment or to advance the film    soundtrack is mediocre and borderline horrible replete with terrible cliché and a very flat and robotic sound from overuse of poor synthesizers let inception horn die already and tropes for movies with desert settings    however the visuals are stunning and very atmospheric and the costuming is fantastic
Feb 19 2024,positive,a truly epic depiction of herberts source material supported by a stellar cast soundtrack and imagery
Feb 19 2024,positive,an incredible work from denis villeneuve that showcases his technical filmmaking mastery very well the sound is full the score is evocative the visual palette is unique to arrakis rather than replicating tatooine this entire film is pure setup which could alienate some fans with regards to story and plot i appreciated the setup knowing there will be a part 2 that will fully realize this storys potential the unfinished nature did slightly take away from the overall quality of the film but there is enough there to keep most viewers highly engaged especially for science fiction fans i would imagine fans of the book are on board with this adaptation overall part 2 is my number 1 anticipated film of the year for 2024
Feb 19 2024,positive,frank herberts most popular story dune comes to life like never before in a movie that is outstanding breathtaking and very beautiful to look at
Feb 19 2024,positive,a very faithful adaptation of herberts classic but also a very soulless one
Feb 19 2024,negative,have read all of the dune books did not think this movie was nearly as well done as the one made in the 80s  certainly will wait for the second on cable thank you
Feb 19 2024,positive,incredible spectacle and world building the narrative is just scattered for me personally and it becomes a chore by the time you reach the 8th paul fever dream about the fremen
Feb 18 2024,positive,denis villeneuves creation is phenomenal timothee chalamet is a chameleon he sealed the deal of being the leading man of this generation real hollywood star the film touched my soul and one of the best in the recent years
Feb 18 2024,positive,i really enjoyed the movie i saw in when it originally came out and i just recently went back for a second time to prepare for the second movie and it was just as good must see
Feb 18 2024,positive,its a spectacle a masterpiece of science fiction i hope part two is even better denis villeneuve is the savior of science fiction in cinema
Feb 18 2024,negative,truly a bore fest nice visuals does not equate to a good movie felt like a long soulless perfume commercial no in depth character progression bland acting and forgettable movie
Feb 18 2024,positive, ratings categories  characters 810  cinematography 1010  plot 810  acting 8510  pacing 910  87
Feb 17 2024,positive,as a movie critic i give it a 45
Feb 17 2024,positive,never saw the original movies but this remake is definitely an intriguing and great entry point for new comers
Feb 17 2024,positive,what a spectcale visually and audibly amazing loved the story utterly gutted when i realised that wed have to wait for the rest of the story
Feb 17 2024,positive,visually pleasing if you have a surround sound this one sounds great interesting story definitely would watch again
Feb 17 2024,positive,the movie looks amazing and beautiful and has really good actors but its kinda long and occasionally boring
Feb 16 2024,positive,i watched the movie hoping for a bit more originality and something different im always useless with character names so having a hero with a nice easy name like paul was quite refreshing to me the characters all seemed to lack depth and the dialogue was a bit shallow it was like they planned the scenes on this massive budget and then just quickly storyboarded a draft concept on the script they then ran out of time and just progressed with the draft script where none of the characters had any depth    i found the story really confusing i watched the movie with my family and we had an unplanned interuption halfway through the film me my wife and our two kids 17  13 had a conversation about the movie none of us had a scoobydo clue what was going on we more or less followed what what was happening but none of us understood why the backstory  explanation just wasnt there we had to accept that the telly tubby emperor was the really bad guy and he stopped liking the other bad guys and basically wanted to give everyone on the whole planet a roasting the bad guys then joined forces with the good guys to take on the emperor     there are several films where ive decided that you couldnt pay me to watch the follow on movie this isnt in that category it isnt awful and i would give dune 2 a second shot the cast were excellent the effects were really well done the budget must have been massive i just hope they sort out the story for the second film and build the characters a bit
Feb 16 2024,positive,as part one begins dune is really amazing and most astounding visuals of all noted as one of the greatest sciencefiction genre by critics and audiences alike which is based on frank herberts novels set in the far distant of the planet with stellar ensemble performances portrayed as noble families from different houses praising for denis villenueves directing costume design hans zimmers score cinematography and others
Feb 16 2024,positive,absolute cinema denis is a director that is not afraid to focus on the deeper side of the story spetacular scifi movie
Feb 16 2024,positive,for a part 1 of a cinematic journey it hits hard leaves some room for desiring more but overall incredible
Feb 16 2024,positive,one of the best science fiction epics in the last two decades worthy to stand up to any modern day science fiction
Feb 16 2024,positive,i liked it enough to want to venture out again for part 2 better than the original at least i stayed awake through the first part here unlike the original where i fell asleep pretty quickly
Feb 16 2024,positive,i never read the book and hated the first film but this one was wellcrafted and very enjoyable
Feb 15 2024,positive,always thought this was a great movie but rewatching after dune part two has turned it into a scifi masterpiece its fascinating to watch and dissect every line of dialogue having the context of part two i also think it flows better than part two
Feb 15 2024,positive,i will watch dune 1 just to refresh myself on the story line coming this march 
Feb 15 2024,positive,meh bad acting too slow poor character development leads to not caring when people died
Feb 14 2024,negative,complete garbage boring and tedious
Feb 14 2024,positive,awesome sci fo movie with great story action and characters
Feb 14 2024,positive,the story and performances start very strong but as the story loses momentum the acting is strained by the weight it must carry i recommend watching the 1984 dune directly after as it fills in some of the lore and character background that enrich the appreciation of villeneuves
Feb 13 2024,positive,second half is definitely much stronger than the first but an amazing movie once you get past around 40 minutes
Feb 13 2024,positive,a bit long but i liked it a lot the sequel looks great and i hope it has the same quality of soundtrack
Feb 13 2024,positive,the movie is a masterpiece
Feb 13 2024,positive,its even greater in imax i saw it in theaters the first round but after getting another chance to see it again in imax is a glorious opportunity not to be missed
Feb 12 2024,positive,the surprising thing about this film is the chill that we are not so far from the temperatures that appear in that time 5060 centigrade i thought it was perfect that they left the first part incognito and waited for a second part overall the story scenery characters beasts caught my attention
Feb 12 2024,positive,dune is definitely a massive cinematic epic movie experience its absolutely stunning to watch in imax screen lead character performances were great set pieces are amazing to watch costumes designs are incredible there are few downsides as well the character introductions arent good feels like we are watching right into an ongoing story there are some dialogues whispering that i couldnt understand and as a plot the movie has little momentum and easily made within 120 minutes instead of 155 minutes    overall dune is impressive in filmmaking wise and visually beautiful apart from visuals theres nothing to be impressed worth watching in imax format
Feb 12 2024,negative,that was a good movie is what i wouldve said hadnt it been for this being a 2 and a half hour set up for the next movie no plot points are engaging because it isnt a sudden  major shift in tone or story its a constant slow journey the only good is the technical aspect 
Feb 12 2024,positive,just rewatched the movie today 224 and its amazing the cast is fire and the entire script and acting are incredible cant wait for part two
Feb 12 2024,positive,this movie is amazing i cant walt for the sequel
Feb 11 2024,negative,hard to follow as looses the storyline others walked out we considered that but stayed in hopes it would get better didnt  the scene form the ads never appeared in the movie  waste of
Feb 11 2024,positive,incredible intimate yet breathtakingly cinematic
Feb 11 2024,positive,the score performances and visuals in this movie are incredible the accuracy to the source material feels spot on casting choices for each character feel well thought out the score does everything you want it to situationally and emotionally overall just a very enjoyable movie there are some slow spots but most will be paid off eventually
Feb 11 2024,positive,awesome cant wait for part 2
Feb 11 2024,positive,omg go see this again and see it in imax also great sneak peak for dune 2 at the end
Feb 11 2024,positive,having scarred our planet by mining this film depicts similar mining activities on other planets  so with natural lessons to be learned quite a long movie but it held my attention throughout although i must add there seemed something a little unwholesome about rebecca fergusons love for her son
Feb 10 2024,negative,the music is constant the dialogue is whispered the sound is horrible great settings plot action but turn the sound off or get a headache
Feb 10 2024,positive,probably one of the best films i have ever seen absolute recommend    if you havent seen then you have to see it   cant recommend it more
Feb 10 2024,positive,an immersive experience this cant get better anywhere but in an imax theater sublime
Feb 8 2024,positive,dune is a must see in every area the movie is a masterpiece especially the look of it as a reader of the book it captures it in the greatest way possible and timothee is exactly what i envisioned paul to look like when i read the book im so happy they split it into two parts instead of following the ideas of the og dune film the acting is great the story is great the only thing i would change is make it a little bit more colorful in the city areas when it comes to how it looks but its not a big deal so watch the movie what is wrong with you
Feb 8 2024,positive,one of the best scifi adaptions
Feb 7 2024,positive,beautiful and atmospheric really puts you into another world it has deliberate pacing and takes itself very seriously so its not something to take your kids to
Feb 7 2024,negative,endless boring streching of build up to something that never happened doesnt matter to what minute you jump the same constant nothing one of the biggest disapointing story ever
Feb 6 2024,positive,one of the best films of recent years but is clearly a setup for part 2
Feb 6 2024,negative,an hour into this borefest i was hoping a sandworm would burst through my floor and try to swallow me just to add some excitement to the viewing experience
Feb 6 2024,positive,as someone who has read all the books im happy to say this is as good as it gets in live form captures the main parts of the story without needing the inner dialogue great film cant wait for the next few
Feb 4 2024,positive,great  waiting for part 2 
Feb 4 2024,positive,i watched the movie and love the visuals but always felt like i missed something important read the books and watched again and appreciate the effort by the film makers to be faithful to the books although alot of stories were cut out of the movie you can tell the heart in making this movie is in the right place cant wait for season 2
Feb 4 2024,positive,watching this at home it drags till the last hour
Feb 2 2024,positive,incredible cinematography entrancing music and elite casting what a visual feast for the senses leaves you wanting more
Feb 2 2024,negative,maybe the book would change peoples idea of the movie or maybe its just not my type of film but i found this movie very slow and very boring it was exhausting to watch and the plot made no idea it felt like i needed to read the book to understand the movie but my grandma said she read the book and she didnt like the movie at all and she really enjoyed the book this movie just wasnt interesting and im curious on how others really enjoyed this movie the only thing going for it to me is the scenery
Jan 31 2024,positive,the hero of this movie is the score hans zimmer rules every scene in this film and thats saying something given that every actor writer costumer the director and beyond are bringing their best to it and just completely devastating us with how good they are dune is storytelling at its finest what a time to be alive
Jan 31 2024,positive,the scenery is captivating great cast and keeps getting better as the movie goes on you never want it to end looking forward to the next one
Jan 28 2024,positive,dune is universally known as one of the most difficult books to adapt to the big screen due to its vast lore and high density of events despite this denis villeneuve successfully manages to transpose this immense story raising his dune into the olympus of the best adaptations in the history of cinema this movie is absolutely flawless on a technical level both from a directorial and photographic point of view and from the point of view of special effects and score it perhaps suffers from the typical problem of all movies that want to be a part one that is the fact of interrupting themselves without a real selfconclusion however even if nonfans of the book might find some aspects of its development a little obscure since some explanations present in the book are left implicit dune remains a gem of the cinema of the last 10 years
Jan 27 2024,positive,great cast solid acting visually stunning f fans of the book will be disappointed by the omission of some of the most iconic scenes but overall it was entertaining
Jan 27 2024,positive,dune is an absolutely brilliant and thrilling film paul is a great protagonist and everything about his character is incredibly interesting paul constantly gets these dreams and illusions throughout the film many of pauls illusions actually happen which proves that he truly can see the future also the visual effects in this film are absolutely beautiful and stunning this film definitely has some of the best visuals ive ever seen the only problem i have with this film is its abrupt ending but besides that this film truly is amazing overall dune is truly an amazing piece of cinema and im definitely excited to see what happens next in dune part two
Jan 26 2024,positive,this movie was an epic awesome story creative world interesting plot no eight levels of selfawareness lovely
Jan 26 2024,negative,im giving it 2 stars not 1 because i only watched about 2 minutes of it there was nothing compelling to make me want to sit through 25 hours of sand
Jan 26 2024,positive,once you get passed the learning curve dune pt 1 is visual eye candy denis has created a universe of beautiful sound and imagery
Jan 25 2024,positive,i just watched the rerelease last night in imax  i was one of those who never viewed it in the theater due to the virus and the availability on hbo max   it was like a totally different experience in theater   wow  the sheer beauty of this film is something wonderful to behold  love live cinema
Jan 25 2024,positive,this was a rare opportunity to get a postcovid experience to watch a masterpiece of a film with other fans of dune this was the best movie of 2021 hands down and i was happy i could relive it in imax for 2023 prior to the sequel
Jan 25 2024,positive,amazing this is my first viewing of dune and now i understand the hype imax laser does this movie wonders i saw this at amc metreon for the one night screening and i love when the entire screen fills up to the 1431 ratio it gives me the feeling seeing oppenheimer on this exact screen did words dont do this review justice you need to see it and experience it yourself to understand just how amazing it is
Jan 25 2024,positive,awesome remastering of the 2021 movie sneak peek is super worth it so keep your patience through the end and the credits
Jan 25 2024,positive,liked the action and fightadventure scenes actors were all great and the backgrounds were captivating
Jan 25 2024,positive,ive seen this back in 2021 but ill say it againa cinematic masterpiece
Jan 25 2024,positive,watching in imax is how it should be viewed its truly a spectacular achievement by the filmmaking genius denis villenueve and if part two delivers just as hard this will be science fiction for the ages
Jan 25 2024,positive,fantastic this is a visually stunning and a captivating recreation of the famous novel the movie jumps right in so pay close attention as there is a lot of detail to absorb both cinematically and narratively
Jan 24 2024,positive,visualy stunning and tecnicly one of the best movies
Jan 18 2024,positive,to say this is the least interesting of villeneuves three big sciencefiction films is a little unfair most filmmakers would struggle to follow up arrival and blade runner 2049 with something roughly their equal adapting a source novel as dense and mired in cod mysticism as this makes it all the harder that the finished project is both coherent and enjoyable enough to not only more than justify its existence but also to justify a sequel is a significant achievement on its own terms     the screenplay works something close to a miracle by being economic with quite a significant of exposition and spoken worldbuilding and the direction is characteristically interesting enough to get us past the denser parts like most of villeneuves films it is visually stunning the whole film looks simply stunning and some of it is expertly designed  i especially liked the shield which shimmers and hums tangibly     i read the book as a teenager   now too long ago to really remember anything  so coming to this as an effective newcomer i did find that some plot developments seemed to appear out of nowhere but not enough of them to distract the biggest issue for me is the films star to this point ive been a chalamet skeptic and here i saw little to change that its true that in epic adventures like this the central character is rarely the most interesting and it may be that the character flowers and emerges in the second film that would make more sense of the performance choices but the combination of the way the character is written and performed makes paul too much of a blank space for  what exactly to be projected on to is not entirely clear theres not enough charisma or interest to anchor the film emotionally rebecca fergusons character has similar traits or lack of them but for me shes a naturally more interesting actor to carry her role past these weaknesses     well see how the second film may change or confirm any of this its looks and sounds especially with zimmers brilliant score quite magnificent and does more than enough to bring you back for seconds
Jan 18 2024,positive,i dont remember the last time i saw a movie this good when you have the ability to geek out about all the details and lore movies like this is perfect for me the slow pacing and build up makes it stand out from all the standard copy paste action movies that keeps coming out and this movie came out at the right moment when i was pretty bored of most movies    also as a big fan of the books seeing a great adaptation like this is a dream come true and with part 2 out so soon watching this before and part 2 after will be a great experience
Jan 18 2024,positive,epic see it in imax 
Jan 14 2024,positive,dune is one of the best movies in 2021
Jan 12 2024,positive,had a really fun time with this one  not surprised that it only made just under 400 million in the box office becuase as it was directed at a older audience and would be quite boring for some one who has a short attention spanbut overall in my opinion it was amazing cant wait for the part 2 coming out this year
Jan 12 2024,positive,a very brief learning curve to understand the dune universe without any prior knowledge of the old dune or the book the feel and visual look of the film is like a mashup of star wars and lord of the rings
Jan 11 2024,positive,first time i watched it at the cinema it was just like a blast to me fresh and powerful beautiful landscape richt story from franck herberts universe faithful to the main aspects of the book i cannot wait the 2nd part
Jan 11 2024,positive,an accurate adaptation of a wonderful series dune part i does a wonderful job of summing up a complex and extremely long book admitting the fact that it doesnt even finish to love the movie is to love the book and vise versa
Jan 11 2024,positive,amazing acting good script pretty close to the book but could be closer amazing music zimmer never disappoints breathtaking cinematography almost perfect
Jan 10 2024,positive,this is one beautiful film what director denis villeneuve was able to accomplish was simply breathtaking naturally i am doing things out of order and watching the movies first before reading the books but this interpretation of the material seems rather inspired mixed with hans zimmers powerful score its a shame i missed this movie on the big screen     aside from a few awkward dialogue moments early on the acting felt like acting my only other gripe is the resistance to use inner monologues villeneuve said the choice was intentional as he felt he could convey the material better without them but to be honest if i hadnt had watched the david lynch version prior to this i wouldve felt lost at times     despite that the film was captivating in a way that i hadnt experienced in a movie before i cant wait for the sequel this fall
Jan 10 2024,positive,yes it could have been more psychedelic and i continue to be slightly annoyed by villeneuves obsession with imagery that is too clean orderly and monocolor for my taste even the dirt and grime in his films are spotless but the books wonderful weirdness is still there and i remain pleasantly surprised to see the heavy word building and exposition was neither too watered down nor so tedious the movie came to a screeching halt even time they had to explain what was going on
Jan 6 2024,positive,better than star wars its crazy everything about it the cgi acting music plot based off the book should watch
Jan 4 2024,positive,awesome first entry into this universe great adaptation from an almost impossible story to adapt well timothee chalamet did an excellent job as did the rest of the cast denis villeneuve has done an amazing job
Jan 4 2024,positive,i stand with this movie an excellent work of art i really cant describe it a lot of great actors great plot cgi writing acting everything warner bros and legendary prods cooked up here
Jan 4 2024,positive,moviereview dunemovie dune2021    ok i have some mixed feelings about this movie i went into this movie not understanding what it was even going to be about because i dont know this story but going into this movie and as i started watching this movie it reminded me of star wars meets tremors    which im ok with both i had to pay close attention so i understood the story i will tell you that timothée chalamet is handsdown my top three favorite actors of all time but hes been that way for years now not because of this movie but he is the reason i went and saw this movie timothéechalamet    this movie is lined up with so many actors and actresses people from so many different walks of life rebecca ferguson is handsdown wonderful in this movie she is basically the equivalent of the queen but they call her lady she does a fantastic job in this movie her and timothee carey the movie completely    now the planes look like dragonflies thats not a spoiler its in the trailer i couldnt follow 100 what was going on but i can say that it was pleasant to watch it wasnt the best and it left me with a lot of questions i wish this edition wouldve made me believe theres a new beginning middle and an end with progression into a possible sequel but i felt like this movie just basically said youre done and were gonna leave you with 1000 questions thats not really great    my friend is at the movie theater now watching this movie because he absolutely loves zendaya but if shes the reason youre going to see this movie then i recommend you watch the greatest showman the first two hours of the movie shes in the movie a minute max and then shes in the last 10 minutes of the movie with maybe one line and the rest shes just staring so she was heavily promoted as a major part of this movie to not even barely be in this film    jason momoa looks totally different with a shaved face but it was nice to see him out of the aquaman role and to see him be able to hold his own in another franchise he really is a great actor but again he has a side character so if youre going to see him in the movie you might have maybe 30 minutes dave bautista it was good to see drax but if youre going to see him in the movie you have about 10 minutes oscar isaac aka moon knight if you are going to see him in the movie you have an hour    no none of that is spoilers im not saying people are alive or dead or in the film completely or disappear no spoilers im just saying those characters are falsely advertised    now with that being said my only thing i could think of that would be a negative outside of your favorite actors being short scenes i would say its a little weird that timothée chalamet is being portrayed as jesus that was a little hard but it wasnt so pushed to make the christians uproar    but yes i would love to see this turn into a franchise and only get better but when i think of a franchise star wars marvel batman scream halloween and even the descendants the first film is always so great that it locks you in and then if the second film isnt so great most movies that gives them a third film to round out the trilogy to make it even better again but this movie definitely missed its mark on the amazing wow factor of the first film so i would say it gets six out of 10 stars timothée chalamet and rebecca ferguson get 10 out of 10 stars    but i do recommend giving it a chance seeing this movie because i think it would be better on the big screen and i also feel it has so much potential to be long lasting the issue is will the general public give it a chance to succeed    
Jan 4 2024,negative,literally one of the worst movies ive ever seen  so so so boring i fell asleep and i was watching it in imax i literally cannot stress how boring of an experience this movie is
Jan 4 2024,positive,great movie excited for part two
Jan 3 2024,positive,absolutely beautiful  an epic worthy of the story  if you love this then you should go back and watch the miniseries frank herberts dune and then frank herberts children of dune to get even more out of the story  and imo the second children of dune miniseries is actually at the same level of this latest movie so you wont regret it
Jan 3 2024,negative,dreadfully boring youll find yourself wishing the worms were real so they would put you out of your misery if you ever feel like watching dune i recommend a slideshow of desert screensavers on a timer its just as entertaining
Jan 3 2024,positive,this was a pretty decent flick  not the best adaptation by any means i actually think the syfy channel miniseries was far superior in its adherence to the source material  the shots were gorgeous if overlong and some of the character changes make little sense in context if you are at all familiar with the novels  overall not a bad film not a great one but better than the lynch adaptation
Jan 2 2024,positive,this new adaptation of dune is fantastic its visually stunning and original the casting and performances are perfect the overall mood and setting hits just the right blend of a grounded real world and high stakes with persistent mystery ominous danger and magic the pace is measured but packed with action and the dialogue is excellent this is definitely the closest adaptation to the feeling and intention of the source material and i cant wait to see the next chapter
Jan 2 2024,positive,a true adaptation of the novel great all across the board and i actually like the 1984 film also
Jan 2 2024,positive,i have to just come out and say its my new favourite movie of all time so what i love everything about it
Jan 1 2024,positive,a masterpiece  a rare gem in todays pile of garbage
Jan 1 2024,positive,im saying its good as it isnt bad and im very much anticipating part two which took way too long for the followup on stuff but a lot of things could have been in way more depth and explanation also maybe a prequel for some much needed explanation and seriously i still dont get the spice
Jan 1 2024,positive,the special effects and battle scenes are amazing and the movie lays a very good foundation for part ii its way closer to the book than i expected and thought possible the runtime could have been shortened a bit though
Jan 1 2024,positive,really enjoyed the movie  cant wait for part 2  id recommend watching
Dec 31 2023,positive,of course i wanted the dinner scene didnt we all but that apart this is the best adaptation yet yes it missed many of the themes of the book but has told the story well and the cinematography was amazing on the big screen really looking forward to part 2
Dec 31 2023,positive,denis villeneuves dune part one is a great film adaptation of frank herberts original dune novel and a breath of fresh air for the scifi genre with hans zimmers fresh style of music absolutely insane cast eyecatching cinematography and complex plot
Dec 30 2023,positive,classic villeneuve perfect atmosphere very good picture cgi was perfect the acting from ferguson isaac momoa skarsgard and brolin was very strong but chamalet and zendaya were the weak link of the movie
Dec 30 2023,positive,was excited to see chalamets lead role in this film played it well but the film left a lot to be desired i know it was only part 1 but the ending didnt leave you feeling like you wanted more
Dec 29 2023,positive,loves the first dune when i was a kid but this is next level  looking forward to 2nd part
Dec 28 2023,positive,denis villeneuve visuals are 1010 story is a little slow to develop but it puts the table for a great part 2 i was entertained and interested by the world of dune which was new to me
Dec 28 2023,positive,i was blown away by this film im not a big scififantasy fan but the cinematography music and wellpaced character development within an alternate universe was outstanding i watched it twice at the cinema within a couple of weeks a diamond
Dec 28 2023,negative,b to the o to the r i n g a bunch of nothing
Dec 27 2023,negative,i thought dune was slow and drawn out  they built up suspense with excellent musical scores but cinematically failed to deliver i was waiting for something to happened and nothing was delivered
Dec 27 2023,negative,i didnt understand the point of the movie 
Dec 26 2023,positive,loved the original david lynch version of dune so was looking forward to a more modern take and excited to see what denis villeneuves take would be was not disappointed even with very highexpectation cinematography was nearly another key character simply stunning loved the establishing of the backstory for the characters in order to set up the second movie  if theres and smidge of a constructive criticism itd be how much of the story was accomplished before the end of part1 but as good as it was it just made me want part2 to start immediately thats the ultimate compliment right
Dec 26 2023,positive,a brilliant redemption of 1984s dune with its wonderful visuals soundtrack and acting performances
Dec 25 2023,positive,wow simply wow this is a great scifimovie cant wait for the next part with the bagpipes again i hope 
Dec 25 2023,positive,really like it  cant wait for part 2 in 2024
Dec 25 2023,negative,boring slow characters whispering for no reason would be a better series show
Dec 23 2023,positive,this is my favorite film  book of all time its the best adaptation ive ever seen there is so much emotion in this movie ive watched it over 10 times i cannot wait for part 2
Dec 23 2023,positive,im a snob for the books and while the effects and costuming were beyond stunning i feel like they completely wiped away the underlying messages and even the point of dune at all in order to avoid controversy especially surrounding religion primarily christianity imperialism and colonization they left in just enough to hint at the storyline but borderline sanitized it to not offend and it seems in the sequel we wont be having quite a few important things either stunning visually lacking the true raw beauty of the depth of the point
Dec 22 2023,positive,great sci fi story cant wait for the next one
Dec 22 2023,positive,a masterpiece epic cast great story telling and amazing cinematography and special effects
Dec 21 2023,positive,in a world full of remakes and rehashes of proven formulas this film is refreshingly unique and does a great job of building a world i hope to see lots more from
Dec 20 2023,negative,cameo porn in the most boring movie i have seen in a while chalamets bored performance made this a chore to watch completely through
Dec 20 2023,neutral,aesthetically cool on the big screen thats pretty much it i suppose it can be appreciated more as a design effort
Dec 18 2023,positive,a straight up 5 out of 5 altough its a part 1 it still can be viewed as a standalone movie and for me its one if not the greatest space scifi ever made a masterpiece
Dec 18 2023,positive,say no moreits a classicand part ii cannot come soon enough
Dec 18 2023,positive,i have never been much of a scifi fan but i enjoyed this one visually looks great good pacing dialogue and acting ill be going to see part 2 for sure
Dec 17 2023,neutral,a lot of hype around this one and i dont see why i did not see the original and big names in this one but the story just wasnt for me too long also and it clearly sets up part two
Dec 17 2023,positive,absolute masterpiece faithful to the books as far as i remember i read them when i was 11 and the soundtrack and cinematography were unreal this is the standard all scifi movies should be set to very refreshing to see an actually good scifi get released post 2010 the casting was amazing and proves it is possible to have a diverse cast without sacrificing quality very excited to see part 2
Dec 17 2023,positive,finally an adaptation worthy of its source material although the pacing is monotonous at first the story does pick up in tandem with staggering visuals  set pieces denis villeneuve has concocted a marvel on a grand scale with enough human emotion that would make frank herbert proud
Dec 17 2023,negative,too sandy need more 
Dec 15 2023,positive,fantastic film truly in asimovs vision also brilliant soundtrack from hans zimmer
Dec 15 2023,positive,much like the original this movie was slow and boring  i also dont understand the current infatuation with timothy chalamet
Dec 15 2023,negative,this was easily one of the most bland boring and lackluster movies of all time the acting was horrible the writing was worse i saw other people talking about the stunning visuals  were we watching the same movie it was a lot of sand and then every now and then a mediocre fight scene watch any war movie of modern day and youll see all the action of dune in the first 15 minutes my gawd if these high ratings are indicator of intelligence were all doomed
Dec 15 2023,positive,im not familiar with the dune story so i came into it not knowing anything about the story line i loved this movie and literally applauded at the end of it im the type that doesnt need an action packed from start to finish experience just give me a good story good characters good acting i love a movie with good cinematography good character development and a compelling plot that i can immerse myself into the characters this movie had all that its kind of like interstellar was for me a grand cinematic experience that had a compelling story to tell
Dec 11 2023,negative,so long and boring didnt even have a storyline  liked the sand worms that was quite good  where was zendaya
Dec 11 2023,positive,world building off the charts really liked this one very well put together from someone who hasnt read the books it got there for me
Dec 10 2023,positive,its ambience was incredible with a lot of tension especially with the sandworm scene but it frankly never hit its stride for me it was beautiful yet very slow with a rather monotone plot that never intrigued me
Dec 7 2023,positive,the movie itself is good my only issue with this movie is the sound it is one thing to be artistic with the approach to the sound but this movie ranges from head pounding deafening to completely inaudible dialogue not sure about the weird sound editing job on this entire movie     the movie arrival was nearly the same but not quite as drastic  i own both arrival and dune and they are hard to watch specifically because of the audio
Dec 6 2023,positive,dune is the original star wars but better the legendary denis villeneuve incorporates practical effects amazing cgi deep character narratives making music its own character and making overall one of the best booktocinema adaptations in hollywood history
Dec 4 2023,positive,this is one of those which you must watch in theater
Dec 4 2023,negative,title a disappointing cinematic misstep    rating     i recently had the misfortune of watching this and to say i was underwhelmed would be an understatement this boasted an intriguing premise but as the story unfolded it became painfully clear that the execution fell far short of expectations    first and foremost the pacing was a major letdown scenes dragged on unnecessarily leaving me checking my watch in anticipation of some meaningful development it felt like the director was more interested in showcasing indulgent shots and lingering closeups than in advancing the plot the result was a tedious viewing experience that tested my patience    the characters despite being surrounded by a potentially engaging narrative were disappointingly onedimensional it seemed as though the scriptwriters had neglected character development altogether leaving the audience with little reason to invest emotionally in their fates the lack of depth and complexity made it difficult to connect with any of the characters rendering the films emotional moments flat and unconvincing    the dialogue was equally uninspired filled with clichés and predictability at times it felt like the characters were reciting lines from a tired playbook of overused tropes the attempts at humor often fell flat and the dramatic moments lacked the necessary nuance to evoke genuine empathy    moreover the cinematography touted as a highlight in promotional material failed to live up to the hype while there were occasional visually striking shots the overall aesthetic failed to contribute meaningfully to the storytelling it appeared as though the filmmakers prioritized style over substance leaving the audience with a superficial and forgettable visual experience    to add insult to injury the climax and resolution were anticlimactic and lacked the impact needed to salvage the film i couldnt help but feel a sense of dissatisfaction as the credits rolled realizing that the potential for a gripping and memorable story had been squandered    in conclusion it was a disheartening disappointment the lackluster execution from pacing issues to shallow characterizations left me questioning the critical acclaim it may have received save yourself the time and frustration  there are plenty of more deserving films and dramas out there to explore
Dec 3 2023,negative,i dont think this movie deserves a high rating in my opinion it succeeded with the visual and cinematic aspects as the director did a great job with it and the cgi looks beautiful as for acting it was decent not the best but not the worst either the movie felt dragged in some scenes with nothing to offer to the story overall music score is bad and felt out of touch in the movie with high vocal which make you feel like you watching some epic historical fights that didnt really relate to the world of dune so hans zimmer didnt exactly hit the spot with this one    if you read the books i didnt then you probably would understand the movie better however if you didnt then you maybe feel a little bit lost in the story so i believe if this was turned into a tv show it would have been better    for me it is an average movie and nothing groundbreaking besides the visuals
Dec 2 2023,positive,frank herberts dune was infamously unadaptable to the silver screen that was until denis villeneuve did his thing its not perfect and i have my minor gripes but i feel denis really captured the quintessence of the book dune walks the fine line between hard scifi and space opera with grace and delivers the spectacle heroics and philosophy fans of the book expect stellar performances beautiful cinematography and a cracking soundtrack from hans zimmer seals the deal denis villeneuves dune is about as good as i could have hoped it could be
Dec 2 2023,positive,a brilliant introduction to this amazing world
Dec 2 2023,positive,such a great movie incredibly atmospheric great casting and performances
Nov 30 2023,positive,finally dune done right  i read the book three times in my life i understand some of the minor changes made even the lord of the rings had changes as novels to films do so im fine with them  it was beautiful to behold well directed and well acted   waiting for dune part ii  hopefully dune messiah will be made to at least finish telling paul atreides story
Nov 28 2023,positive,one of the best scifi movies made in the past few years the plot is interesting and has me hanging on the end of my chair for the whole movie the only reason i didnt give whole five stars is because dune 2 is so late
Nov 28 2023,positive,spectacular performance that captures the essence of the book well a must see for all fans of science fiction
Nov 27 2023,negative,i expected them to improve on the many failings of the original movie the original movie had something magical that made it a cult movie despite weak special effects and some odd photography choices this new attempt is basically the opposite with a cast of a thousand good special effects and excellent photography the movie falls flat on its ass it looks completely fake like a job well done no magic a sad waste
Nov 27 2023,positive,yooo where my hive mind at    4794660344
Nov 26 2023,negative,another empty vessel of a modern movie filled with eye candy maximum style points but overall pretty painful to watch as the movie lurches from one predicament to the next as beautiful scenery rolls by i found myself caring very little for any of the characters in fact most of them were little more than annoying
Nov 23 2023,positive,a must see cant wait for part 2  hopefully a part 3 as well 
Nov 21 2023,positive,not quite another star trek or star wars but in that vein  characters are hard to like despite noble traits
Nov 20 2023,positive,a whole four stars the movie brought me on board with the franchise where i would otherwise may not have come this movie has room and time to grow sandworms were pretty neat and of course zendaya plays a role outside of her spiderman films that i actually kind of enjoy definitely need a dune 2 and look forward to watching it great acting and immersive worth the time for the watch and great character development im sure the bookworms arent impressed right now but hey they try
Nov 19 2023,negative,not sure why this movie gets good reviews everyone whispers through half the movie most of it is under lite in a desert world no color and why was aquaman out of the water
Nov 17 2023,positive,i love this movie cant wait for the next
Nov 15 2023,positive,great cgi most was a great cast not paul atreides my fave books are the dune collection bad casting for paul and irulan or chani wasnt irulan be the beautiful and a real temptation to paul irulan really liked him before the hell broke loose syfi series was the best one yet please change my mind cause zendaya is too cute for plain chani paul liked irulan paul is plain tiny and boring over and out
Nov 13 2023,negative,i was so excited about a movie that shows what it will be in the future the acting was phenomenal the imagery was exceptional but the storyline got blown into peices when at the end there was a challenge to kill a fellow worrier to earn your spot to be accepted wtf so hollywood is telling us that 8000 years into the future that we still live like savages sooooooo disappointing
Nov 13 2023,positive,one of my all time favorite movies denis villeneuve is a master of his art form
Nov 9 2023,positive,an spectacular film about how fast family can be torn apart with rivalries and unfamiliar environments with the remains of the family learning to adapt and survive after their sudden loss
Nov 7 2023,positive,dune its a modern masterpiece
Nov 3 2023,positive,great example of how good adaptations are when they hold true to the source material the cast and world is also phenomenal
Nov 3 2023,positive,so amazing and it kept true to the books the changes made were really incredible and it all looked amazing favourite movie ever
Nov 2 2023,positive,seasoned of the greatest scifi films ever made the fact that villeneuve nailed a story that was largely considered unfilmable is almost an afterthought incredible script brilliant cinematography a killer score hans zimmers career best and great performances especially rebecca ferguson are what makes this film such a masterpiece it isnt going to be for everyone but to me its fantastic cant wait for part ii
Oct 29 2023,positive,from what i understand dune is an adaptation of a book series and this may be the reason the storyline in the movie is so slow despite the slow pace the cinematography in the film was great by choosing to film outdoors and use real sky and sunlight to create incredible reflections and accurate lighting something they couldnt achieve by filming on stage using wellbuilt sets and props they really bring scenes to life i think they could have made some elements clearer such as a distinction between the houses as that was a bit confusing in some scenes there was also a lot of missing context and scenes that provided context for events that did not happen of course knowing that this is just part of a series the context of the storyline or lack thereof of it could be provided in the book or later in the series i just wish they would have provided more im not entirely sure about the casting of the characters but i think for the actors that they chose they did the best they could its pretty heavily stacked with bigname celebrities like jason momoa zendaya and timothee chalamet to name a few i also probably could have done without seeing the barons bare bottom but it is what it is
Oct 27 2023,negative,boring  its long and drawn out  one good scene out of the whole movie  the tone of the movie is dull  timothys acting is horrible i feel no relation to him or want to see him succeed  the plot is meaningless to me  i dont understand the high rating  even bad reviews give it a high rating  doesnt make sense
Oct 25 2023,positive,this is just like a poetic dream that is beyond a beautiful experience i read the book after watching the film and this film version does justice to the reader this should be 100 just watch it
Oct 24 2023,negative,all the ingredients of a great movie minus enjoyment
Oct 23 2023,positive,an amazing epic that was truly great for people that have and have not read the book
Oct 20 2023,positive,an absolute mustsee for anyone who likes scifi and the best film of not only 2021 but of the decade so far
Oct 20 2023,positive,a solid film with beautiful visuals but god damn theres something about timothee chalamet i cant take seriously
Oct 17 2023,positive,i read the books they did an excellent job adapting it to film the kid that plays paul killed it he is the way i imagined him to be when i read the books many years ago
Oct 17 2023,positive,nice visuals and sound effects yet i wasnt really hooked on what happens in the movie things seem to move kinda slowly
Oct 16 2023,positive,i could rewatch this amazing cinematic masterpiece at any chance i get loved it
Oct 15 2023,positive,stellar in its scenery and intense in its storytelling about a prince beginning his journey to hero dennis villeneuve crafts the world of dune with striking setpieces and an artistically done soundtrack the highly anticipated second part of this duology cannot come fast enough
Oct 14 2023,positive,i enjoyed the books and i think this does a fantastic job of bringing the story to the screen much better than that david lynch version the knife fights are especially well choreographed im looking forward to the second movie
Oct 14 2023,positive,not bad a huge improvement over the 80s version i was disappointed that i never got a good look at a worm though    ive heard good things about the series that came out between these but i havent yet seen it
Oct 13 2023,negative,im sorry to say how disappointed i am at this move the casting and acting are very good but the directing is horrible it is not often that a leave a negative review but this is not good at all the original is amazing  but this is far from the original for example there is a battle scene where i cant tell who is who both sides are not developed i cant tell what is going go they are all cover up with uniforms that i have never seen before  it could have been taken for another movie very disappointed i will not watch part ii part i was free on netflix i feel bad for all the great actors that are in the move sorry about the low score but i have not meet anyone that like this movie maybe it is just me and my friends good luck watching this one
Oct 11 2023,positive,too much movie could be a lot less screen time
Oct 11 2023,positive,visually thrilling very good performances by the actors the score is outsanding one of the greatest book adaptations of all times
Oct 11 2023,positive,the best frank herbert interpretation by far although some significant parta of the book are left out the core base is there the cast is allstar and the directing is world class
Oct 11 2023,positive,very close to book adaptation that i can appreciate
Oct 10 2023,positive,being a fan of the of the novel i can proudly say that dune is a worthy adaptation to herberts classic and finally allows us to rest knowing that the task of conjuring a fabulous adaptation to the book has been fulfilled
Oct 9 2023,positive,visually appealing well acted  no levity or humor  suspensful 
Oct 8 2023,positive,perfect adaptation of the book so far dune is to scifi what peter jacksons lord of the rings is to fantasy 
Oct 8 2023,positive,dune is an immersive work its kind of slow even during the action but the production quality is very high
Oct 7 2023,positive,watched this with my boyfriend and we were so into it we both admitted we havent seen a movie this great in a long time its truly epic and fascinating and the acting is great its a very realistic sci fi film compared to so many cheesy ones you actually feel like youre witnessing another planet and unusual societies  i love the main actor as our rising hero its awesome
Oct 7 2023,positive,it was challenging for me to stay glued to the screen for the entire duration of the movie 2 and a half hours the scenes with complete silence were uncomfortable as were the moments when the characters whispered to each other its a onetime watch for me there were too many foreshadowing moments that felt like spoilers for what would happen in a couple of minutes
Oct 7 2023,positive,surprised how good this movie actually is the only thing i didnt like was they cut it off right and when its starting to get good
Oct 7 2023,negative,dune 2021 is an enormous vapidly hollow toilet load that seriously needs to be flushed four or five times before it stinks up and infects the entire house its mind blowing what vapidly hollow tripe pro critics and audiences accept today as worthy of their time and money
Oct 6 2023,positive,how can you not love it if you like the books that is
Oct 6 2023,positive,i think movie is a little bit boring
Oct 5 2023,negative,i cant unsee the 1984 version it was designed by h r geiger and had sting in it harkonan  is pronounced with a hard ko so this adaptation is visually weak by comparison the writing is often hacky over the top over explained for people who refuse to read the books was that a taxidermy bull head just a sophomore treatment of the source sorry its not art and its barely dune not sorry
Oct 4 2023,negative,it was so bad so bad but it has such good ratings if you are a fan of dune and have seen the lunch version or the scifi channel version this version is much worse in every aspect dialog visuals characters color everything sucks you are just waiting for it to be over if you have never seen or read dune well i cant imagine this is a good move there is no life to any of the characters or scenes its just bleak scifi puke with cgi stink yuck  watch it and see for yourself     the book is so deep in developing the world and characters the other movie adaptations are not perfect but at least they get some things right the lynch version was amazing with characters and visual imagery especially for the time it was innovative  but was too short to tell the entire story the scifi channel version actually did the book justice what it lacked in big hollywood names and budget it made up for in good storytelling and acting this new version just misses on every aspect no redeeming qualities whatsoever nothing innovative nothing special i can only guess that this movie was not made for dune fans it was made like most movies today just some money grab who cares people will watch it because they have heard of dune
Oct 3 2023,positive,the director has an kubrick like look for the details and visual layers of a story and he has the talent to bring that feeling for that composition to the actors mainly working in front of green screens there are only some films in history with that level of perfection
Oct 2 2023,positive,it looks like real director perfectly change novel to movie make season2 faster
Sep 30 2023,positive,good sifi movie i think its best movie watch it and enjoy
Sep 29 2023,positive,dune is an imaginative masterpiece for those who want to get lost in a distant world     denis villaneuve seeminly put his heart and soul in this movie incredible attention to detail unique costume design and believable world building dune offers an escapism experience comparable to the original lord of the rings thrilogy     the movie can be a slow burner and dissappoint those viewers waiting for actionpacked scenes it establishes the world of  frank herbert staying true to the source material the viewer discovers the political themes and the main characters a modern classic that was created for generations
Sep 27 2023,positive,what a weird movie the plotstory tellingwriting is lack luster but this movie still manages to land based completely on cool factor ie the visuals and audio 
Sep 24 2023,positive,nearly a perfect movie in my eyes cant believe people dont like this movie recently in my favorites excited for all the other movies to come out
Sep 23 2023,positive,what an amazing movie cant wait for part 2
Sep 17 2023,positive,i never been a fan of denis villeneuve other than prisoners and i really did not like blade runner 2049 because he felt very long and not very intriguing to me but dune feel like blade runner 2049 but better is still has a long pause is but those long pause is actually meant something the story of this felt very very neutral in the world building was really really visually impressive ive read one book on tune but i can safely say that my favorite villain in all books is the baron and his people this has very good scifi element that i dont even know whats possible and felt like this could actually exist somewhere in our world today the only things that did not stick the landing was the cliffhanger even though its a proper cliffhanger still feel like some questions that need to be answered but overall a really good film and i cant wait for part two 910
Sep 16 2023,neutral,whilst this is the first of two parts of this film this version of dune is not as impressive visually artistically or in story telling yet the orginal film made in 1984 had its faults but it was visually impressive had the spirit and essence of the dune story and accomplished actors in the main roles it also had great music     sound is at the forefront of the bene gesserit weirding way its power and influence is the means by which paul muaddibusul defeats his enemies but this hasnt become apparent yet note i have also read all of the books in dune story and was inspired to do so after watching the film in 1984
Sep 15 2023,positive,dune is a cinematic masterpiece where everything from set design casting score editing and vfx come together like a well orchestrated symphony villenueve has risen the bar for all cinema and proven himself to be one of the greatest directors for creating the best movie ive ever seen its the first movie ive seen that is even better than the book and part 2 will be even better
Sep 13 2023,positive,audio and visually its probably the most beautiful film ive ever seen the director dennis villeneuve keeps on knocking out bangers although i havent seen the latest blade film
Sep 12 2023,positive,dune is an ambitious and magnficient scifi epic that leaves a lingering effect at the viewer and presents a powerful meditative and gripping experience that is enhanced by denis villeneuves extraordinary direction and the casts solid performances there are some things that could have benefitted from better detailing but thats about it
Sep 12 2023,positive,i found the plot to be sluggish subservient to grandiose ideas that got lost in their meaning it is my opinion that character development was weak the director and producer took 2 12 hours to tell you to wait for the sequel to make sense of it all
Sep 7 2023,positive,i thought this movie was good the way their society is organized is fascinating i loved the story it was a part one but even then it was great and makes me excited for what is to come in dune part two i would recommend this film to anyone it is a wellacted and written film that anyone would enjoy
Sep 6 2023,positive,such a relief to not have screen writers ruin the story as has happened with many other adaptions excellent cast  cinematography and effects looking forward to next instalment
Sep 6 2023,positive,mmmmm really wanted to love this movie but for some reason it just didnt grab me  nice visual effects but for me it was lacking some edge of seat dramaaction watchable but i cant recommend it
Sep 3 2023,positive,a very good science fiction movie
Sep 2 2023,negative,it was rubbish  nothing compared to the original movie  and what a stupid idea to make it into two films  why do a remake when you cant improve or even do as well as the original  very disappointing  definitely not waiting for part 2
Aug 29 2023,positive,for the longest time ive heard a lot about the story of dune considered to be one of the greatest scifi stories ever made but the biggest disappointment in cinema history the 1984 cult classic is not without its merits a stellar cast and a great director but a prime example of studio interference tv has given it an even worse name with its studio edits and rumored fivehour directors cut which has never been realized denis villeneuve however with his interest and successes was given the reigns and made a glorious film that was years in the making    in a far distant future human civilization has made phenomenal advances in fasterthanlight travel but not so much in government and the distribution of resources going to war or subjugating other worlds for such resources in this case for the spice that fuels fasterthanlight travel human civilization is an empire at odds with ruling houses that fight for the spice of the world of arrakis the house of atreides and the house of harrakan with duke leto and his family doing what they can for the empire and its people but treacherous intentions as well as a prophecy motivated the natives of arrakis toward the dukes son paul an insurrection causing destruction but salvation as this is only the beginning of the adventure    wow i never understood the acclaim the story received until now frank herbert created a great story and i can see how this was screwed up on the big screen the 1960s was subtle and modest with science fiction but it only blew up when star wars erupted the market but the studios werent patient and saw only the potential for money and not a great story but this director was given the freedom to realize the story to its fullest potential and i cannot wait for the second part of this epic to be realized
Aug 29 2023,positive,the beautiful song of dune     seeing the imax of dune 2021 is an enveloping powerhouse experience that borders on the spiritual it is a beautiful and ornate psalm that feels ancient as if this story known was to us subconsciously we just need to see the movie to unlock it and bring it forth into our consciousness there is a melody to the movie that can only be heard in imax becoming a sistine chapel experience you do not need to understand everything that is going on to be swept away by the beauty that you see and hear just like enjoying the melody of a song without knowing all the words part of the mystery is part of its charm it has integrity it doesnt feel like it was a part of a million focus groups where we are held by the hand through the journey    part of the prayer structure is archetypal troupes familiar in joseph campbells heros journey threaded through a palace drama full of competing kings vying for power at the end of the movie the palace drama is replaced with a kind of exodusnew testament a mother with her messianic child in the desert  heeellllo journey so much of the book is internal dialogue what is staggering is how much the actors and editors can communicate and capture nonverbally with their internal dynamics along with that the dream sequencesflashforwardsprescient visions are used to get into the mind of our hero as he tries to make sense of it all and his place in the world    its themes revolve around selfreliance on computers colonialism and the plundering of ones environment for resources it is a warning about religion and fanaticism putting ones faith in a chosen one designed specifically by those in power to obtain more     the future messiah realizes he is a pawn or meant to be a pawn to those in power the bene gesserit and he does not believe in their messianic propaganda machine that has been at work for generations but something frightening is happening to him and he is on a path that is beyond him and if he is a true messiah he sees the dystopian future of what that deliverance will rot surprisingly the filmmaker does a better job of establishing this relationship than frank herbert does at least in the first book and it never seems rote or a chore to the artists they have the tools to shape the words to life    the staggering piece is the consolidation of exposition on these dozen or so characters and finding their motives and place in the story what is efficient is how much information is given to the audience visually the mentats eye movements and their tattoo commonalities help us identify them in their respective kingdoms lady jessica  place in the movie is not explained until leto says i should have married you it is a great line for the readers of the book but i could imagine the viewer with no knowledge of the book being confused by that if she is not the wife then what is she well the movie does not have time to explain it is on a tight schedule    humbled by this futuristic biblical movie i am grateful to have a substantial dune movie where the producers have respect for the material and are not slaves to the running time like the previous version with jawdropping special effects a stunning cast music that shakes the foundations and calls out to our ancestors as well as our descendants and editing so intuitive taking us into the fractured mind of our hero attempting to put together their destiny it is a movie that feels tied to the past and the future just like frank herbert the filmmaker does not handhold the audience with every piece of exposition either you are on board or you are lost at sea like a dream where some foreign object holds some familiarity but you can not explain why you simply understand the relationship to that item without it being explained to you i feel the gravity of the material waiting decades for capable hands to set it free onto the silver screen with technology advanced enough to bring these images to life the hundreds of artists in all departments clinging to the filmmakers singular vision and getting that vision across i can feel the filmmakers hands on the image after so many people have to help realize it    the movie relies on all the elements of filmmaking to form a seamless masterpiece it is a trumpeter up on a parapet belting out notes that strike a sonic cord to the ancestors within us awakening parts hidden from the conscious world ironically the movie transforms frank herberts words into images and sequences that onto themselves defy language my minds eye absorbs the film and the response back 
Aug 28 2023,negative,dune is visually and audibly stunning sadly the film relies on its beauty to carry the sluggishly paced story through most of its long runtime examples include extended shots of chalamet thinking and equally extended shots of zendaya in the desert with robes flowing in the wind similar to what we see in perfume commercials the story does pick up and leave you wanting more by the end but the majority of the runtime is unnecessarily hollow although beautiful
Aug 27 2023,positive,one of the best movies ive watched for years cant wait for dune 2 the story line  the graphics  the star wars kinda of theme is just out of this world
Aug 27 2023,negative,i found it incredibly boring to watch my only compliments to this film  is the acting and  it was visually stunning
Aug 26 2023,positive,incredible visuals acting score storytelling and cinematography  stays true to herberts novel while bring its own unique elements
Aug 25 2023,positive,a visual delight absolute delight 
Aug 23 2023,negative,fantastic supporting cast but timmy sucks the life out of pauls character after all the hype did it even recoup its production budget   i see  108 million usa box office and that cant be half the cost im a villaneuve fan but that doesnt excuse the substitution of topnotch fx for a clean storyline driven by acting and long boring verbal exposition kills this movie when it would have been better to let the audience fill in the blanks based on composition of a scene and the actors use of facial expression gestures and body language  you knowwhat we call acting i read the books i know what will happen so ill save my money skip part 2 and maybe wait for it to show up online somewhere a year later
Aug 20 2023,negative,the film doesnt seem to make much sense from start to finish so much unexplained lore that makes the film hard to keep up with only redeeming factor is an good cast but that was a waste due to the plot will definitely not be rushing to see the sequel 
Aug 19 2023,positive,it is a bit slow but its only the beginning sets a good stage i wonder if this would have been better as a series instead of a movie
Aug 18 2023,positive,first time i tried to watch it i was probably not giving it the attention it deserved i therefore rewatched it with my kids this evening since i heard dune 2 is around the corner this time i was fulle focused and the movie pulled me in its a wonderful story both of personal growth and also a fascinating overarching world story my kids was as invested as i was great movie
Aug 17 2023,positive,an ambitious effort to take on the sprawling work of the dune novels but villeneuve here pulls it off in an exceptional manner while not perfect this slowburn epic is lead by its beautiful art direction and is set up for what promises to be an intriguing part two
Aug 16 2023,positive,nice try but the atmosphere of the 80s movie was way weirder and better i will see the second part but just because i need the end
Aug 15 2023,positive,follows the same path as the movie by david lynch just with more dramatic yelling and way more advanced special effects which was the main reason why the original failed and its not necessarily bad it is good enough adaptation but not worth 35 oscars for sure
Aug 15 2023,positive,i usually struggle with slow burn complex films they certainly dont spoon feed you but it is not focused on 10 different characters so it really works the cgi and scenery is so tasteful the acting is amazing i  adore it i love how you dont really understand why the dictator does what he does do we ever really understand why leaders do things also such a scary take on the world we live in as a brit especially it is a tough watch the only thing i did not like was there is no way ferguson is old enough to be chalamets mum but i quickly got over that this is the longest review i have ever written and that tells you all you need to know about this insane film
Aug 14 2023,positive,great movie im so excited for the second part
Aug 14 2023,negative,boring boring boring the movie is totally overrated i forgot the plot the second i walked out of the cinema it didnt deserve a single oscar
Aug 13 2023,negative,can not hear half of it as sounds were over powering and it left my wife and myself totally lost in it  waste of time watching this
Aug 13 2023,positive,superbly done beautiful cinematography costumes on point i have few gripes with this film acting is on point zimmer is fantastic with his score as usual little to no objectionable content would consider for young teens on up just for the scary images and violence highly recommend
Aug 12 2023,negative,similar to star wars but a lot slower and no suspense
Aug 11 2023,negative,disappointing  not enough action
Aug 9 2023,positive,just the best scifi movie i have seen until today and i think i have seen at least everyone which is better known  it has a production quality of the old days when movies were not made with a checklist for target audience but in mind of making a good movie
Aug 8 2023,positive,besides the casting there is nothing that i should like about dune yet for almost 3 hours i was watching it with full focus simply this movie is just a good period
Aug 8 2023,negative,utter garbage david lynchs dune was farrrrr better by leaps and bounds  heck even the scifi channel miniseries remake of this back in 2000 was better its sad to see younger generations get sucked in and deceived by flashy scenery and special effects and then think it is quality cinema its not
Aug 6 2023,positive,i was expecting a little more from the main character but i guess thats why there are 2 parts great movie nonetheless
Aug 1 2023,positive,my thoughts are only positive and this is a magnificent movie denis villeneuve is a great director and this just keeps him at the top the cast is great to marvelous timothée chalamet and jason momoa are the best but everybody else has also got a place on the great performance list
Aug 1 2023,positive,dune is one of the best and most unique films made recentlyfabulous cinematography clever script and superb acting makes this film a near masterpiece looking forward to the sequel
Aug 1 2023,positive,this movie holds up well on a rewatch but that might be because i could better grasp the names and characters this time around this film has stunning cinematography and a sweeping musical score i love that it takes its time to establish itself and the places and vehicles in this world feel real  however that being said i think pauls visions could have been more visualised with different colour grading or something i also think this film wraps up too late and goes on an act to far it feels like its wrapping up and the plot for the second film seems to have been establish and then it goes on for an extra twenty minutes i cant really decide whether i really like this film or not because it feels like a really big set up for the second film i guess ill just have to wait and see
Jul 31 2023,positive,gorgeous visuals and a profound plot with superb acting and music what more could you ask for from such an epic work of art
Jul 31 2023,positive,fantastic worldbuilding narrative and a great cast
Jul 30 2023,positive,very hard to find a good film these days i almost stopped watching films after watching dune i feel i can fast forward watch 25 films to find a film as good as dune
Jul 30 2023,positive,perfect thats all i can say
Jul 29 2023,negative,having just finished the book i dont think ive watched a movie so far from the source material the major events happened but the characters and plots were so distorted i didnt find it enjoyable the direction of the movie made all the characters one dimensional in an effort to focus on spectacle not my kind of film i always prefer writing and direction over spectacle
Jul 29 2023,positive,fantastic actors amazing setsthe story is interesting and epic but takes its sweet time to get going one of thé better scifi movies you can find out there
Jul 28 2023,positive,the thing about denis villeneuve movies is that they are original science fiction people are misleaded and have very little knowledge about science fiction even though the story is adapted from a novel the way he portrayed the dystopian world with the postapocalyptic fabril and biopunk elements was awesome as a student of science fiction the movie was very fascinating to me we can observe the biblical references throughout the movie and do i even need to mention about hans zimmer even after the movie is done the music stays on your mind it wont leave you the screenplay was slow which is expected from the director but whatever runs on screen seems so perfect the music the vfx the acting and direction everything seems so perfect i am hyped up for the next part
Jul 27 2023,positive,one of my favorite films of all time excellent cinematography sound design special effects soundtrack and overall immersion
Jul 26 2023,positive,greatest scifi movie of the century might not be perfect but the cinematography music sounds and ambition remain unmatched
Jul 26 2023,positive,incredibly good adaptation of a fantastic novel  an extremely large film and it seems to get better with each viewing for me
Jul 26 2023,positive,great character writing expertly woven exposition and great attention to detail in the worldbuilding as well as fantastic acting just wish the sci fi tech was better explained and utilized as it makes most of the actions scenes a confusing mess particularly notable with the shields which seem to have no internal consistency at all throughout the film
Jul 25 2023,positive,the best adaption of the classic scifi novel
Jul 24 2023,negative,accepting that the oldschool original wasnt able to compete with star wars this modern remake boringly failed to generate original ideas yet again chalamets small acting in his already hallow lead role couldnt match the enormously meandering plot the cast seemingly hired based off popculture trends gave minimal effort so expectations for further chapters will be low until proven otherwise
Jul 24 2023,positive,pretty good movie visuals are crazy but the plot is meh
Jul 23 2023,positive,this movie was fantastic it had great action and high stakes the cinematography and acting were excellent as well it was a visual spectacle for sure i am excited about part two
Jul 23 2023,positive,a phenomenal visually stunning borderline masterpiece a complex multilayered story told in a brilliant simple way excellent casting creating several goosebump moments building towards a portentous momentous conclusion
Jul 23 2023,positive,i love this movie it has a really good story
Jul 23 2023,positive,visually much better than the original story still the same so no surprises
Jul 23 2023,negative,a cinematic masterpiece with only a minor problem spoiling its excellence the characters and the writing and the plot other than that really good
Jul 22 2023,negative,switched it off after 30 minutes as it was boring and dull might come back to it after ive finished painting the skirting board
Jul 22 2023,positive,a fantastic largerthanlife portrayal of the immense novel by frank herbert denis villeneuve very convincingly brings the source material to life cannot wait for part 2
Jul 22 2023,positive,looks great and promises so much   only for it now really to deliver in this film in the end it felt much more like an epic tv show than a film the major point of interest was how much star wars ripped off im amazed that nobody sued lucas
Jul 21 2023,positive,this movie is great in all the ways a movie has to be to be good firstly the easier part the visuals the visuals are great in this movie thats how much one needs to hear despite the differences of how things look compared to the descriptions in the book are the changes well made to fit a bit more tasteful pallet with nice industrial and both futuristic designs that are more like the current depiction of what is futuristic the execution of all this is as well great everything feels like it could be reality and the designs feel like they have purpose meaning that they make sense and are not there for no reason   the story and storytelling the story is only a small part but already great in this department the changes were always good compared to the books and nothing seemed out of place the storytelling is very good everything tells a story conversations actions and every detail it is very well executed and nothing feels like it is there for no reason the only thing is that it can get quite long but despite this it all feels in place the extra time gives suspense and the right feel for the world of dune which is really about the mind and the mind finds a place in time and the vastness of the movie and like the book
Jul 20 2023,positive,what an experience i cant wait for the continuation yet now the expectation is set where as before it was more a possibility full of potential well told story amazing actin and the cinematography is breathtaking
Jul 20 2023,negative,a soulless dry telling of an epic masterpiece of science fiction  the director confuses volume for filmmaking and paul atreides is a dishrag waif posturing badly as a messianic leader the art design looks like it came from a video game and almost no one in the cast seems to give a hoot
Jul 19 2023,positive,lost yet couldnt stop watching was not ready for the ending left me wanting more
Jul 17 2023,positive,fantastic movie   with rich story telling easy to understand to me new journey new tool and gadget something that i cant see in other movie  so excited for sequel cause the ending is very cliffhanger
Jul 16 2023,positive,this movie is an incredible adaptation of half of my favorite book ever dune this movie has an incredible cast that all turn up amazing performances along with one of hans zimmers best scores i read the book and i can say that this movie fits its source material like a glove a few things are changed like dr liet kynes being a girl when she was a boy in the book but i dont care about that change the barons personality was also changed for the better making him ominous instead of a jokester a few things are removed to shorten the film but those things are boring and serve no purpose to the story denis villeneuve did a great job with this film and he was a perfect fit for the source material the visuals are absolutely stunning and rival the avatar films its one of the only movies in 2021 that i cared about i am very excited for the second part and how villeneuve will adapt it
Jul 16 2023,positive,a terrific adaptation of the first half of frank herberts classic scifi novel featuring a stellar cast strong if sometimes slow storytelling and epic action sequences grade a
Jul 16 2023,positive,enthralling and another fine  underplayed performance after the king by the young lead
Jul 11 2023,neutral,watched it on a long haul flight i heard good things but really it was very bland i didnt dislike it but i didnt like it
Jul 11 2023,positive,straight up amazing i watch this movie multiple times a week so good
Jul 10 2023,positive,if you love star wars and game of thrones you will love this movie i was pleasantly surprised how hooked i was for the entire 25hrs its rich with visually stunning landscapes captivating story lines extraterrestrial wardrobes and effects and profound characters that draw you in emotionally and physically im so excited for the sequel
Jul 9 2023,negative,the pacing of this movie was so weird the scenes didnt feel like they made a coherent storyline it was just confusing it also didnt make me care about the characters
Jul 9 2023,negative,honestly despite the stunning visuals and interesting source material i was bored throughout this movie im not sure if its because im frustrated that the ending led to nothing or if its too lengthy but i was not drawn in
Jul 9 2023,negative,worst movie ever if you ever saw the original you would know in an instant that this movie sucks so bad and isnt even close to the originalhorrible movie worst director on earth
Jul 7 2023,positive,after falling asleep through the original i was skeptical this however was really well done storytelling was clear paced well for a 25 hour movie
Jul 7 2023,positive,a little slow in the beginning but overall a great film and watch amazing scenes and some great acting this plot is incredibly interesting i am very excited to see how part two wraps everything up 
Jul 7 2023,positive,an incredible work from villeneuve he made the impossible to bring the story to the big screen
Jul 7 2023,positive,under the skillful eye of dynamic partnership villeneuve  fraser sweeping visuals and an astounding score make dune the golden standard for all scifi epics for years to come
Jul 7 2023,negative,the lead actor was so feminine unwatchable
Jul 6 2023,positive,literally my favorite story of all time
Jul 5 2023,positive,absolutely stunning adaptation of the first half of frank herberts dune the visuals are spectacular as they always are in denis villeneuves films the character building is fantastic and the dynamic of the story is spoton to what the original novel intended cannot wait for part two 55
Jul 5 2023,positive,it seems that producers and directors keep struggling to present this tale  based on the voluminous novel written by frank herbert  the novel relates a detailed story it tells of a unique world its full of hardware science and fictional descriptions that allow a reader to create a vision of this fantastic world and its convulsions it makes me want to get ahold of some spice to expand my mind  but movies are graphic and do not need to verbally fill in details of all the minutia  they can show us these things as the story unfolds without drowning us in needless verbal discourse or useless demonstrations  this version of dune gets stuck in the details as did its predecessor at the one hundred minute mark i find myself wanting to get to the climax but wondering if i ever will   its not a flop its well acted and the cinematography and special effects are great but i have to keep getting up for breaks so i can sit and enjoy a bit more without falling asleep the musical score never overpowers but is an accent to the story  all in all its watchable but its a three and a half not an four or five
Jul 5 2023,neutral,beautifully filmed but contains no emotional connections to the characters the movie is entirely too long and there is nothing about the plot to grab you and make you pay attention i watched until the end because i kept hoping it would get better or maybe i would start to care about any of the characters spoiler it doesnt and i didnt 
Jul 4 2023,positive,finally a director made a version of dune close to the book  awesome effects stellar script
Jul 4 2023,positive,once you get past the slow start it is a really good movie the special ware stunning
Jul 3 2023,neutral,characters are far more intense than the film explains why feels forced
Jul 3 2023,positive,long film great sci fi its like an epic like lord of the rings im excited for part 2 can be slow at times but interesting sci fi plot and acting
Jul 1 2023,negative,my god its bad it just drags on and nothing happens i feel asleep it was so boring
Jul 1 2023,positive,love the visuals and the cast as well as the interesting characters
Jul 1 2023,positive,awesome movie great cinematography and story
Jun 30 2023,positive,one of the best experiences that can exist on the imax screen the soundtrack the story the characters everything fits together it leaves you wanting to read the books and delve into the lore of the saga
Jun 29 2023,positive,absolutely amazing l loved every bit of this movie
Jun 29 2023,neutral,the starstudded and beautifullylensed dune led by the remarkable villeneuve is somehow only occasionally engrossing despite the worldbuilding and all the somewhat talky and uninspired screenplay make this new dune far too middling and vanilla
Jun 27 2023,positive,good soundtrack from reading the book there is better spots to conclude
Jun 27 2023,positive,i loved absolutely every aspect of this movie  world storytelling visuals and music everything worked perfectly average denis villeneuve movie id say
Jun 26 2023,positive,epic scale and action that does justice to the book
Jun 25 2023,positive,when dune came out i had no clue what it was but i knew i had to watch it it looked like a mix of starwars and something dystopian finally i watched it at hotel and i kid you not this was hands down one of the best scifi movies ive ever seen i learned more about movies from this movie the cinematography writing score and the acting is all great before i had no clue what dune was next thing i knew i was watching videos breaking down the lore and watching the original dune 1984 haha that rhymed which i also liked and both of the mini series it is definitely something to watch if your looking for an awesome modern scifi movie im definitely excited for part two and i cant wait to watch it
Jun 25 2023,negative,one of the main shortcomings of dune lies in its storytelling the film suffers from pacing issues particularly in the first half where the narrative feels slow and drawnout the expositionheavy dialogue aimed at explaining the complex dune universe becomes overwhelming and tedious at times failing to engage the audience fully
Jun 22 2023,positive,light years better than the original
Jun 22 2023,positive,epic easy to forgive it if all its faults
Jun 22 2023,positive,vast stunning exiting mysterious dark this is the way dune should have been it far surpasses previous versions i cant wait for part 2
Jun 21 2023,negative,dune was almost a masterpiece keyword being almost to me it failed hugely because of one simple reason timothee chalamet was nowhere near a good fit for the role throughout the movie his demeanor and portrayal of lead character paul was painful to watch he did not encapsulate the regality or composure of a man going through what paul went through especially when accounting for the training and environment the character would have been raised in the only point in the movie i found his acting passable was when he snapped at his mother following his fathers death he plays an upset child fairly well but that was it for a movie that should be placed in with other all time greats because of its visually stunning special effects and all star cast it falls flat very flat
Jun 21 2023,positive,910  very good start to a series looking to see what comes next
Jun 20 2023,positive,kynes doesnt sell it for me the messiah is in her midst and she hesitates  the actor is miscast and her direction shows it villeneuve was hampered by this woman
Jun 19 2023,positive,i loved this movie for its great story its pacing and the performances given by most of the cast ofc there are issues with some of the casting especially for me personally the casting of zendaya shes not a particularly talented actress and her presence in dune 2021 reeks of diversity hire and just another incident of her being thrust upon another white male lead the fremen also are a strange mix of subsaharan african and arabnorthern african which is poorly thoughtout especially considering the homogeneousness of all the other people groups in the movie the casting of the fremen feels unfaithful as frank herbert clearly intended for them to be arabic demonstrated by his bastardising of arabic words and religious naming of the group as zensunni combining sunni islam and herberts own zen buddhist beliefs the movie would have been 5 stars if not for the irritating blaxploitation that hollywood apparently cant resist nowadays but ill give it 4 for everything else
Jun 18 2023,positive,br filme exuberante com uma ambientação linda e digamos quieta um filme onde sua atenção é prendida do inicio ao fim filmagem roteiro atuação entre outras coisas do longa são incríveis e muito bem dirigidos ansioso para a parte dois    eua exuberant film with a beautiful setting and shall we say quiet a film where your attention is held from beginning to end filming script acting among other things in the feature are incredible and very well directed looking forward to part two
Jun 18 2023,positive,while this movie differs with the book in certain important ways its hard to fault it for that when the product still manages to hew closely enough to the plot all while telling a story with strong points and engaging characters  the visuals are stunning such as the ornithopters  i think this is a rare win and look forward to dune 2
Jun 16 2023,positive,the movie was magnificent instantly one of me favorite soundtracks
Jun 15 2023,negative,how can you put so many of my favorite talented actors into a movie and the movie is just so blah and boring and pointless and puts me to sleep how is that even possible how do you do that like seriously what kind of drugs were you on when you made this movie but the one good thing is i can put it on and itll put me to sleep when i have insomnia so u get 1 star r that
Jun 13 2023,positive,the visuals were stunning and musical scores were amazing  the biggest flaw in dune is trying to tell such a complex story with so many elements to it that it gets choppy
Jun 11 2023,positive,great reboot galaxy of dune nice design outfits and combat style to make this version unique cant wait to watch part 2 with framem tribe
Jun 11 2023,positive,it is an amazing movie it feels really grand the sound design and the visuals are on point my only problem is the casting  i understand that timothée chalamet and zendaya are great actors and they do a good job acting here but i cant help but see only timothée chalamet and zendaya and not the actual characters on screen
Jun 8 2023,positive,this may be the best movie ever made
Jun 7 2023,positive,dune is a masterclass on how to make a serious scifi film in an age where scifi is being destroyed by commercialism its well directed well shot well acted well written and well edited every inch of it has been expertly molded for a beautiful adventurous cinematic experience the story is amazing and keeps you entertained the entire time the characters draw you in and make you connect with them you will be visually stimulated the entire time by the beautiful landscapes and detail of this universe i cant say enough about this fantastic film     in summary everyone needs to see to experience this movie we need more epic scifi films like this in the world
Jun 7 2023,neutral,i want to like this movie its probably better than 25 stars but i cant tell because its too dark to see and most of the dialogue is too soft to understand
Jun 5 2023,negative,timothée chalamet is the only good thing in this movie it is too long tedious nothing is really remarkable its nothing compared to other movies like lord of the rings
Jun 4 2023,positive,the best scifi movie ever made cant wait for part two and further sequels from this director whos killing it in hollywood now 1010
Jun 4 2023,positive,fantastic adaptation of the book if they remain this faithful through the rest of the trilogy this will be on the level of lord of the rings
Jun 4 2023,negative,yet another hollywood rehash splitting the movie in 3 to make more money
Jun 3 2023,positive,as the movie ended i felt like i needed to watch everything again and absorb more details from it the pacing is a bit slow but its necessary to set the mood  theres a few flaws but you can point it back to the source material i cant wait for the sequel
Jun 2 2023,positive,this was epic i dont remember feeling like this since my early child hood 30 years ago ive found out the next instalment is on november 3rd i loved guardians of the galaxy but this might just be my best film if it was a toss up between which i could see now and which i could never see id choose this i work in construction and this played the rounds some months ago never really paid attention jesus did i miss out the trailer didnt do it justice i see 1 and 2 stars out there are you guys mad i couldnt find a fault with it it was great to see some old faces especially drax from guardians of the galaxy and our favourite fish guy jason momoa might have butchered that name but im dyslexic give me a break yeah na i will def keep my self alive on the building sites just to see part 2 also for the wife and kid yada yada yada
Jun 2 2023,negative,i love villeneuves movies i love zimmers scores i have the physical copies to prove it but this movie just really wasnt for me boring uninteresting drab with the same screeching female vocals every time theres sand or zendaya on screen flat performances stop putting timothy chateaubriand in everything please gonna pass on part two
May 31 2023,positive,loved it a nonhollywoodized epic for the ages a great work and instant classic in the likes of star wars lord of the rings blade runner and harry potter i hope part two will continue with the same mastery all around from the acting to the direction production and cinematography
May 30 2023,positive,ive never read the book  it is beautifully shot the music is wonderful the acting is well done by most however i feel like its in the era of the 1st movie is only setup as its a bit slow and nothing much happens
May 30 2023,positive,probably the best film adaption so far cant wait for part 2
May 30 2023,positive,shockingly good   nowhere near the camp of the original movie but with amazing effects and solid acting  needs more patrick stewart tho
May 29 2023,negative,cannot wait to read what is known as the greatest science fiction novel in history but the movies first part did not wow me past the historical significance of the story
May 27 2023,positive,visually stunning slow burn pacing that is true to the source material one of the best sci fi movies in decades
May 25 2023,positive,i think they kind of clickbait you with zendaya its like movie click bait shes only in it for like 3 minutes probably more i dont know besides that this movie was really good it kind of felt like a grand story with lots of opportunities and a grand world to adventure and i like that it takes itself very seriously and slow and it works i liked most of the characters the set pieces ive grown to like more and the costume design is incredible still there is a couple shots that feel a little empty in some ways but this is a pretty great movie im excited for the sequel 710
May 23 2023,positive,dune 2021 has excellent world building and visual effects but still fails to pick up the pace
May 23 2023,negative,painfully slow very little at all happens in the first half of the movie not a great deal more happens in the climax of the movie and then suddenly it is over without the slightest hint of resolution or even a compelling cliff hanger for the sequel had both this movie and its sequel been combined into a 2 hour movie it would have been tolerable but instead we get half a movie stretched to over 2 and a half hours and which feels much longer
May 22 2023,positive,i enjoyed the movie as much as the book a very welldone movie with amazing effects and great actors the visuals and the score are beautiful
May 21 2023,positive,denis villeneuve ands hans zimmer if you know those names and their work you wont be disappointed
May 20 2023,neutral,nice vistas some good actors but skinny 12year old timothée chalamet just fails at his role unconvincing and bland he cant hold a candle to dune 2000s alec newman who owned paul atreides
May 20 2023,negative,dune for the undemanding
May 19 2023,negative,well watched it on amazon prime for free yesterday and im glad i didnt waste any actual money on it the intro of this movie feels weird and it was handled much better in dune from 1984 there were more then enough scenes in the new movie that made no sense and could have been cut without second thought it feels they were added to inflate the run time and justify the second part and the ending is as weird as the intro overall a movie you can watch once when it becomes available for free on any streaming service and be done with it going by the trailers id say the same goes for the second part
May 17 2023,negative,slow confusing and overhyped
May 17 2023,positive,dune is one of the most breathtaking visual pieces of art that i have ever seen every moment was well designed and created a universe of wonder not only was the setting gorgeous but the acting was articulate as well timothee chalamet captured the role of paul wonderfully and has quickly become an actor to watch in the industry    my main difficulty with dune was the sheer amount of information to digest from arrakis to harkonnen to the bene gesserit there were more than a few moments that i had to take a step back and ask myself what in the world the characters were talking about with a excess of whispering intermingled with other languages the plot at times became disjointed that being said i loved the different forms of communication between paul and his mother    the best comparison for this film is the fellowship of the ring full of deep backstory an abundance of detail and more than a few dull moments fotr became a masterpiece because of what followed in two towers and return of the king i see the same thing happening with this film assuming the sequels are made dune could be remembered as a marvelous feat in exposition however if those films are never green lit this film will be difficult to rewatch as in itself it is incomplete     i left the film hopeful for a sequel and satisfied with the experience i just had to read dunes wikipedia page to understand the full story that i just watched at least i could remember the greatest name in modern cinema duncan idaho
May 16 2023,positive,finally dune on the screen like it is suppose to beok they are some slight deviation from the book but you can really feel that mr villeneuve loves the book and love the storyand the visuals are amazing
May 16 2023,positive,this movie stirred emotions in me i never felt before the cgi in this show is phenomenal allowing me to suspend disbelief for the whole show it is also expertly acted and the soundtrack is amazing this is the first movie ever where i immediately restarted it and watched it again and then again 1 favorite movie of all time
May 16 2023,positive,could it be better probably not what an amazing visual experience with epic story telling cant wait for part 2
May 15 2023,positive,great movie really faithful to source material and stunning visuals cant wait for the sequel
May 13 2023,positive,i literally love everything about this movie the pacing soundtracks casting acting dialogue ahh just everything was perfect anyone who says that it was too slowpaced just doesnt appreciate good film making
May 13 2023,negative,it sucks looooooooooooooool  wow they really suck bro zendaya donate kiss timmyhe she loves tom holland this movie sucks boooooooooooooooooooooooo
May 12 2023,positive,so much better than the original version i am looking forward to seeing part 2
May 11 2023,negative,dreadful long boring movie shot in the dark for the most part it relies on loads of fx to mask the rubbish dialogue and plot had more fun watching paint dry
May 11 2023,positive,i weasel mesmerised through the entire show the visuals were stunning  the characters were deep and the overall tone just drew me in it played close enough to the original story to do it justice but built a new world and level of enormity that was fantastic i cant wait for the sequels
May 9 2023,positive,i havent read the book this was based on but my brother has and i found his insights helpful  not absolutely necessary to enjoy the film but definitely helpful   the first time i watched dune the storyline kept building up to a moment and it seemed like after that moment the meatier part of the story would start so i kept waiting and waiting right when i felt like the storyline was starting to pick up and the foreshadowed events are unfolding the movie ends it didnt feel like a complete cliffhanger but definitely a theres more yet to come moment and at least part of what has yet to come has already been alluded to i hate cliffhangers so i wasnt sure how i felt about it but oddly i found myself drawn to rewatch the movie and im so glad i did i found it way more nuanced the second time and i find myself going back to it again and again im not someone who normally rewatches movies but with this one i appreciate the story a little bit more each time thankfully theres a sequel already in progress so if you absolutely have to know how everything unfolds next we wont have to wait much longer
May 9 2023,negative,this was a slow movie that failed to interest me  timothée chalamet is an overrated actor and the only reason that this movie was even remotely popular is because of the endless wave of fangirls fawning over him the characters were so in depth that my favourite character was the worm who still had more emotional complexity the every other character in this film
May 8 2023,positive,great movie i cant wait for the next one however i can see how this might be hard for someone who knows nothing about this universe
May 6 2023,positive,epic cant wait for part 2
May 5 2023,positive,amazing denis villeneuve created such a beautiful movie incredible cinematography and a great storytelling
May 5 2023,positive,the visuals were fantastic and timothée chalamet was surprisingly excellent  i didnt expect him to be a good fit but it turns out he was perfect they should have shown more scenes with the navigator guild and explained the background better which is the only reason i didnt give five stars  rare is the move i see twice but thats what i did with dune
May 5 2023,positive,high level fantasy scifi story telling this is as good as its gets  basically a perfect movie  acting writing directing cinematography costumes all top notch  then the hans zimmer score brilliant  you can be disappointed in the ending but its a true two parter  it would have needed to be 6 hours long to tell the entire story in one movie or it would have felt cheap and not true to the book
May 4 2023,positive,one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life
May 4 2023,positive,its one of the best film with best sound
May 4 2023,positive,because i havent read the books i was very lost but i liked it and look forward to the sequel 
May 3 2023,negative,the problem with this movie is the sales let me explain i understand hollywood wants to sell as many movies as possible but this stifles creativity and innovation the problem with dune is theyve chopped the nuts off it to make it a 12 to sell more seats the movie book is supposed to be deeply violent and dark by making it a 12 you just arent going to get the brutality strangely the movie in my opinion is actually too grim for 12 year olds so congrats youve made a movie suitable for no one everyone will say bla bla bla visually stunning but at the end of the day this movie is forgettable because its not visceral enough the original is actually more memorable and there were lots of problems making it
May 3 2023,positive,overall the movie was an absolute masterpiece of cinema from the visuals to the world building to the characters absolute masterpiece
May 2 2023,positive,it a good adaptation of the first half of the book
May 2 2023,positive,dune i firmly believe will be the next generations star wars its new its original and has the potential to world build fantastically i left the theatre purchasing a second ticket to come and watch it again later that week i cant wait for the next one
May 1 2023,positive,i like timothee chalamet but the movie is pretty slowmoving it was a long movie
Apr 30 2023,positive,dune that was a good one
Apr 29 2023,positive,i saw this movie in a massive cinema and it was incredible and the cinematic was beautiful
Apr 27 2023,positive,entertaining but not a bit too long for me
Apr 27 2023,positive,with its amazing visuals epic action sequences a wonderful cast of characters with some standouts and the faithfulness to the first half of frank herberts novel i think we can conclusively say that dune finally has the blockbuster adaptation it deserves
Apr 25 2023,negative,very slow bad story telling and a little boring if your not familiar with the source material its difficult to follow along
Apr 25 2023,positive,i absolutely love this movie the visuals are stunning you can absolutely see the hard work behind the scenes the storyline was due to his huge range in topics and events difficult to understand and to follow to clear things up i personally recommend reading the books they give you a lot of background information about the events that are not fully explained or not showed detailed enough in the film nevertheless its interesting and has a lot of aspects which are not fully linked to each other making you curious what will happen next the actors played the roles really well     i would definitely recommend watching the movie and it s a mustsee for all science fiction lovers including me i am giving the well deserved 45 out of 5 stars well done d
Apr 23 2023,positive,dune is  og and goat thank you for taking time to bring this to life
Apr 21 2023,positive,35 stars   dune is a classic science fiction story told in an almost biblical fashion it is the story of warring kingdoms and the hope of the coming chosen one there were some great special effects to represent a different type of technology    the biggest problem the film had was that it just took too long to tell the story   two and a half hours on top of that the plot itself was very slow moving in order to remain true to the story there are many complicated characters to feature i actually watched the film in two hour and 15 minute sittings  that seemed to help me maintain focus
Apr 20 2023,negative,a very slow and tedious watch it seemed like they were trying to see how many long desert pans they could fit into a single movie the characters dont have much emotion in their acting so its hard to feel invested when not even the characters seem that invested in their own story   also the sound mixing has major issues its very difficult to hear what the characters are saying with them mumbling in monotone all the time  at least the plot is somewhat interesting but its difficult to follow and moves at a snails pace its hard to follow at times and gives off the same feeling as if youre walking in on the eighth episode of a tv show with no prior knowledge its probably most enjoyable to the people who have been long time fans of the original dune which i prefer
Apr 19 2023,positive,this is probably the best movie adaption we will ever get of one of the best and most influential scifi books every written dune
Apr 19 2023,positive,denis villeneuve made a masterpiece his dune is amazing i cannot wait to see dune part two
Apr 18 2023,negative,timothee chalamets  kendall jenners modeling
Apr 17 2023,negative,an emotionless walkthrough of the original no passion no anything
Apr 14 2023,positive,looking forward to the next one 
Apr 13 2023,positive,audiovisual masterpiece but without a sequel for now feels not that strong as a standalone movie
Apr 11 2023,positive,a franchise that i was to lazy to get in to but was blown away after the movie probably my favorite movie of all time great acting engaging story espetacular visual effect sound photography just perfect a true masterpiece really anxious for the second one
Apr 10 2023,positive,the dune book could be separated into a trilogy or a tv series it is a blend of game of thrones scheming and science fiction due to its complexity and the deeply defined world it is a huge accomplishment for such a book to be transferred to the big screen so well i would compare the dune movie to one of the lord of the rings movies in terms of source material to big screen translation however unlike lord of the rings movies it is not immediately apparent what the story and world are all about to the viewer this is also due to lord of the rings having a fairly simple story in comparison where all the quest is already determined whereas dune has the characters slowly discover and realise their own ambitions overall a job well done to the entire crew
Apr 10 2023,positive,dune absolutely excels at world building right from the start its clear how intricately crafted the world is which gets you immediately hooked into the story while the plot moves along slowly i think this is a positive as it gives more time to flesh out the details of the world making for a much more immersive experience this is perfectly complemented by incredible music which always captures the perfect emotion for the scene its in and absolutely stunning visuals which make the time spent on showing them well worth it the plot itself is very compelling with the power dynamics between the great houses and the emperor being very much like game of thrones from the start dune does a great job at portraying paul as a worthy hero who generally wants to do the right thing and isnt selfish or vain when the credits finally roll dune has completely accomplished its goal of getting the viewer hooked on the world and excited for the next installment which i certainly am incredibly excited about
Apr 9 2023,positive,cant really give a strong opinion as it is the first part of hopefully many but from what i saw it was great
Apr 9 2023,positive,fantastic this film made me believe that these different planets and cultures actually existed a film to be seen at the cinema acting was almost universally great storyline held my interest throughout only downside was that i thought it didnt end on a highi guess that it is part one after all
Apr 8 2023,negative,this movie was completely overrated when released i didnt understand barely any of it it was like youre supposed to know more before watching it but theres no prequel just a bunch of adaptations i wouldnt watch this movie again or recommend it very boring and underwhelming
Apr 8 2023,positive,honestly i was so disappointed the sequel isnt coming out until fall 2023 its absolutely engrossing
Apr 7 2023,positive,i rewatched the movie and needed the urge to write that this movie must be seen by every human eye
Apr 5 2023,positive,this has some of the best visuals ive ever seen in a movie and as a fan of the book it was a phenomenal adaptation of the concepts and characters in the book
Apr 5 2023,positive,it was a good adaptation though i need to admit that i prefered the version from 1984
Apr 5 2023,positive,the visuals are fantastic the world building is definitely toptier and the cast does wonderful work but as for actual plot the movie follows a basic formula that makes it nothing special     usually i personally forgive movies lack of plot depth if they are at least very entertaining but dune will often leave you locked into scenes that will lose your attention and make you snap back thinking whats going on again
Apr 1 2023,positive,i had been anticipating villeneuves adaptation of dune for quite some time but after seeing it it mainly went to show me that when stripped of herberts wordy prose dune as a story is fairly formulaic and unsurprising    im glad the movie didnt stray far from the source material but like lynchs film before it this new dune movie also fails to understand the real protagonist should be the planet itself and ended up feeling mostly like a shoddily connected highlight reel missing all of the emotion from the books rather than a true rendition of what i read in those pages all this time ago     the dull lighting direction and muted colors certainly didnt help either on the other hand the costume design is great and there are some beautiful shots in there it also takes its time to remind us that yes under this soulless exterior is still a villeneuve film
Apr 1 2023,positive,this was the dune fans of the novel have been waiting for for 50 years no actors thrown in that dont fit the parts no weirding modules thrown in because the director just had to have ray guns no poetry no heart plugsjust tell the story thats on the page and represent it well while the fremen werent explicitly portrayed in the novel as darkskinned it makes perfect sense that generations of living in a harsh desert environment would make them so the only issue i had was the unnecessary genderbend of dr kynes it wasnt a huge deal and i couldnt fault the acting but one of things that brought paul and chani together was the shared loss of their fathers having chani lose her mother  parent at that point of her life doesnt carry the same impact but again it isnt that much of a gripe i cant wait for part ii
Mar 30 2023,positive,this one of my favorite cant wait to see the second part
Mar 26 2023,positive,fan of the book the movie is well made and holds its own
Mar 22 2023,positive,favorite of all time please film through letos reign at least
Mar 20 2023,positive,its a good movie  the cast especially rebecca ferguson and oscar isaac are excellent and perfect for their roles  the only one who didnt feel exactly right was javier bardem as stilgar  the movie is faithful to the books and does an excellent job of capturing their tone  in some ways its even better than the books which is a very rare feat  my only complaint which is the same complaint i have with the books is that its too long  i watched 150 minutes and it was really only the beginning of the story  watch it  i dont think youll be disappointed
Mar 19 2023,positive,it was a very beautiful and insightful attempt at a story that is nearly impossible to tell it does the book justice and bring a beautiful perspective to it the sound in the film brings so much to the experience the cinematography was very well done its very difficult to judge if the film works for people that have not read the book because i have a few times for a person familiar with the books the fill stands up well im very impressed
Mar 19 2023,positive,great movie with great story brilliant characters and amazing world didnt read the books and now i probably will really interesting stuff
Mar 19 2023,positive,what a rare thing to find a silver screen adaption that is truly faithful to the source material masterfully shot and well acted dune was ahead of its time when it was written  it is a massive complex scifi tale that spans time and space  those without an open mind and willingness to think critically need not bother i am grateful to this crew for bringing it to life in such a big beautiful way i honestly cannot wait for part 2 i have a feeling the best is still to come
Mar 19 2023,positive,excellent sifi world building and performances denis villeneuve does it again
Mar 16 2023,positive,very different from the trailer but also good bill xx
Mar 15 2023,neutral,this is by far one of the hardest movies that i have rated simply for the fact that its a blatant and bold lovehate feel  this would in my opinion be one of the best if not the best film release visually and otherwise  however  the bookmovie being split in two was not a good idea and reeks of only motivated by the greed of 2 premiers which hollywood has been doing a lot in recent years milking an already tapped out public out of hard earned money to spread out the movie over a 3 year period and build up anticipation for the second part these days is cruel and unusual  the audience is well used to 253hr and even 4 hr movies nowadays and most of use binge watch out series shows that only leaves a very money hungry studio as the culprit for this flop of film release frenzy advice take a clue from streaming services who release entire seasons out at once you earn much deeper loyalty other than that i absolutely loved this movie they could have ended in a better place though
Mar 14 2023,positive,the best movie made in 21 centcury
Mar 6 2023,negative,had high hopes but was disappointed that there  wasnt enough action and too many flashbacks in dreams
Mar 6 2023,negative,slurping and chewing with their mouth open  the noise drives me crazy i did not finish the movie
Mar 5 2023,positive,i just wish the movie went on for longer and more details were gone into and that the harkonnens were more evil and grotesque as per the earlier version  that said however this version is superior to the earlier make in almost every way however and does the book justice i actually found the film better than the book as the book tended to be quite longwinded in parts  i was glad i saw this at the cinema for first viewing as it truly enhanced its epic scale  loved the throat singer of the saudarker battle preparation and many other aspects of herberts world were executed with a fascinating strangeness almost horror befitting of the tale  just snuck in for 45 stars the strongest part of the film was it stayed true to the book a real relief and a credit to the writers and director it could have been really awful otherwise  look forward to the next instalment
Mar 4 2023,negative,so long and very boring plot the movie produer assumed we had all the time in the world to watch this sht
Feb 26 2023,negative,60 minutes of mindnumbingly dull and pretentious exposition followed by a 90 minute soundtrack of relentless semitones so loud you wont be able to hear for days afterwards occasionally interrupted by a few words of melodramatic nonsense absolutely horrible movie
Feb 26 2023,positive,a very unique classic scifi epic film this is designed to tell a epic story while also setting up the next film which can be a dangerous risk that fails much more often than it succeeds however this remembers to stay focused and tell its own story first acting is great across the board with very good performances but the standout is timothee chalamet who slowly won me over particularly in the second half as a compelling hero as we watch him begin to develop the cinematography is the best element of this which is phenomenal with great depth and scale to each shot that never feels lifeless despite the dull color palate a remarkable achievement the special effects are very well done also with very clean cgi and practical the music is very good always feeling epic and mysterious but also never feels catchy and can be overused and does start to beat you over the head sometimes with just to remind you again 2 hours in this is supposed to feel epic the editing is very well done also despite being a bit loaded in the first half setting up the journey  the only issue is the pacing which isnt bad at all this is a film that justifies its length by being a epic story with epic shots to take in however it does take a while to set that up because there is so much it is trying to get in in the first half i think some of it couldve been trimmed perhaps or better explained in a less slow and spread out way something like lord of the rings the fellowship of the rings first 10 minutes does however despite the pacing not being up to snuff with everything else and fitting a lot in slowly this is a unique epic that anyone who is a fan of epics the source material the director or any actors in this should give a watch fyi it does help to be familiar with the source material going into this as it kind of assumes you know it somewhat
Feb 26 2023,negative,this movie is made for people who read the book i did not read the book and it was confusing boring and l have no desire to watch i it again or see the sequel   compare to lord of the rings which most people i know didnt read the books and loved it from beginning to end
Feb 24 2023,positive,its not a full 5 star just because i got really disappointed they took a book and chopped it right in the middle
Feb 23 2023,positive,finally a perfect adaptation from the book  cant wait for the sequel
Feb 23 2023,positive,channeling the book into film is challenging but the writers and director did an amazing job the important beats were hit the visuals were breath taking and the casting was on point interested in seeing how they deal with the second half of the source
Feb 22 2023,positive,i must admit i still believe frank herberts dune to be unfilmable i realized that watching dune part one in my local movie theater today thats why people who have read the book should see this movie adaptation as a single piece of art    forget the book while watching this movie dune the book drives on the thoughts and inner emotions of the characters  the things that are left unsaid visually that can only be adapted to a certain extent    villeneuve has done a better job than anyone could ask for i think he had to compromise on not bringing even more details to the movie considering that the majority of the people will not have read the book the information overload would have been difficult to follow for most    this movie is definitely slow so if you are accustomed to constant dopamine stimulation then you might find it boring    the visuals in combination with the soundmusic are hauntingly beautiful and will stick in your mind for a long time i got goosebumps almost throughout the entire movie    dune part one definitely serves as a stepping stone for dune part two and more to come if you are looking for action dune part two is definitely the movie to be waiting for so grab some friends and go watch this movie
Feb 22 2023,positive,visually spectacular its been a long time since i read the book so i cant speak to how faithfully it reproduced the source material but it felt genuine i cant wait for part 2
Feb 20 2023,negative,writing was horrible  theme was completely nonexistent  zero character development  most of the actors seemed about as emotionally invested as one might expect if they were reading the ingredients on a bottle of shampoo  everyone involved should seriously rethink their career decisions after being involved with this patchwork collection of cutting room floor mistakes
Feb 20 2023,neutral,sooo much boring fighting scenes that i had to skip to not be bored to death entirely   they honestly seemed like fillers meant to drag the movie longer that also meant there was sadly not much dialogue visuals were good but not a movie i would watch again
Feb 16 2023,neutral,i dont get it drawn out too many stories lines and plots unless you read the book its just hard to pull for the characters or care big production yes but was bored to death
Feb 14 2023,negative,the movie suffers with the script of already unadaptable books it has  wonderful visuals and sound design but those dont make a movie good enough to remember
Feb 14 2023,positive,denis villenueve brings viewers a starstudded scifi blockbuster that brings frank herberts 1965 novel to the big screen villenueve adds to his recent string of scifi epics following on from the 2016 amy adamsstarring arrival and the oscarwinning blade runner 2049 the acclaimed director works alongside doctor strange writer jon spaihts and a star is born writer eric roth to bring the bestselling novel to the screen    timothée chalamet stars as paul atreides son of duke leto atreides played in the film by oscar isaac and main protagonist of the film paul is a man born into an unspeakable destiny who must travel to a new planet to ensure the future of his family and his people but with conflict over the planets most precious resource only those who are strong enough will survive chalamet stars alongside a packed cast that includes rebecca fergurson zendaya oscar isaac and javier bardem dune features solid performances throughout its entire cast but its doubtful any will be receiving recognition considering theyre up against knockout performances from the likes of jamie dornan benedict cumberbatch will smith and caitríona balfe    despite being an explosive bigbudget scifi epic dune still manages to convey emotion through its more intricate scenes renowned composer hans zimmer crafts an incredible score for the film zimmer creates a score that keeps in mind the books middle eastern and islamic influences dune features breathtaking cinematography courtesy of lion cinematographer greig fraser frasers cinematography brilliant captures the extensive explosive action sequences and the closeup emotional scenes brilliantly even though the scale of dune led to the first book having to be adapted into two films villenueve manages to make this film not feel too overstuffed or confusing to viewers who arent familiar with the original novel previous villenueve collaborator david dastmalchian makes an appearance in the film adding to his already successful year that includes performances in james gunns the suicide squad and the animated marvel disney show what if    much like the original book dune delves into many themes including power fate and free will as shown in various conversations through the film but also through the fact that the bene gesserit a social religious and political force comprised of women with mysterious powers has the ability to control those around them with something known as the voice  an audioneuro control mechanism that forces others to do things against their will the film explores themes like family and finding and taking your place in the world around you    costume designer bob morgan provides dune with intricately detailed costumes that keep in mind the films cultural influences and show a mix between the films medievalscifi nature this mix and also the contrast between the futuristic outfits with the more oldfashioned ones helps to emphasise and show that in this future modern technology like phones and computers no longer exists denis villenueve manages to convey the size and scale of dune to viewers in a way that doesnt feel overwhelming or fullon instead the french director eases viewers into this new futuristic world    dune is an intense dramatic scifi affair that features solid performances from its entire cast the film doesnt inundate viewers with an encyclopaedia of knowledge to take in all at once much like how david lynchs 1984 adaptation required viewers to be given a handout explaining various aspects of the film before screenings denis villenueve gives audiences an exciting and visually pleasing blockbuster whose visual aspects make the film a unique yet enjoyable viewing experience
Feb 10 2023,positive,featuring unparalleled size and scope denis villeneuves dune provides a cinematic experience while forgetting to deliver a complete story to say the vision of dune is grand would be an understatement its a visual feast combining elements of the middle ages with those of the future for a feeling that closely resembles hbos raised by wolves its this marriage of genres that sticks out foremost in the opening minutes of the film a noble house house atreides has been assigned to guard and oversee a planet by the name of arrakis desert and useless but for its supply of spice mélange the most valuable material in the known universe this spice mélange or spice as its simply referred to is a naturally occurring psychoactive chemical makes human beings stronger faster and smarter most of all though the spice is necessary for interstellar travel as it allows the navigator to properly guide ships through warp space with a resource that valuable one could imagine that not everyone in the universe was happy to see arrakis being taken by house atreides the harkonnens arrakis outgoing caretakers are less pleased to be losing their financial boon and though they honored the emperors decree seem eager to do something about it in the middle of all this are the people of arrakis the fremen who live on the desert planet and who have been forever altered by their constant proximity to the spice the fremen have impossibly bright and blue eyes from their exposure and their ability to fight has been drastically increased for the same reason making them both alluring and frightening simultaneously arrakis itself affectionately referred to as dune is a magnificent wasteland and home to giant sandworms capable of swallowing settlements whole these worms use a sort of echolocation to hunt homing in on vibrations that they can feel from the surface the biggest of these creatures is referred to as shaihulud and it is worshipped as a sort of god by the fremen who have adapted to living with these giant beasts as you can see there is a lot of narrative being weaved into this cinematic experience so much so that it would be easy to miss some of the above details in the films first 30 minutes of mostly exposition once the places are set the story begins to lurch forward with house atreides trying to protect the fremen the spice and arrakis from the harkonnens and by extension the empire paul atreides timothée chalamet is the young heir to house atreides though he is reluctant at the films start his father duke leto atreides oscar isaac makes it clear that he is not some despotic ruler and that paul doesnt need to take the helm if he so chooses letos demeanor is stark in contrast to his rival house and represents what is presented as a forwardthinking perhaps even progressive leader pauls mother lady jessica atreides rebecca ferguson is the official concubine of duke leto atreides and deeply interesting in her own right lady jessica is a member of the bene gesserit sisterhood an order of women hellbent on advancing humanity through genetic experimentation and religious engineering via their chosen one known as the kwisatz haderach this order also possesses several superhuman abilities like complete metabolic control superior combat abilities and the voice the voice is simply a tone or frequency perfected by the bene gesserit that they use to compel others to do things almost like a jedi mind trick with parents like these its no surprise that paul is special too even before reaching arrakis paul starts dreaming of a fremen girl zendaya who we later come to know as chani its clear as soon as paul steps off the ship that his fate is uniquely tied to that of the fremen people as they refer to him as lisan al gaib which translates to tongue of the unseen realms and refers to the one who will bring water to arrakis desert world there is so much narrative to follow that it might be easy to miss out on the unparalleled backdrops that make up arrakis for a desert world its awfully pretty action scenes are a delight for much the same reason usually taking place against the backdrop of some sand dunes and an endless sky there is one bone to be picked like a fremen sword from a sandworms maw and thats the personal shield devices having never read frank herberts series this reviewer cannot say how truetoform these shield devices are or how important their utility becomes but from the onscreen presence all the shielding seems to do is make oneonone fight scenes difficult to watch with the shields constant blurring they also seem to be an uninspiring device because they never seem to impede much damage its a minor nit to pick in general and theres reason to believe that as the series progresses it might settle better but in part one it seemed gimmicky and unnecessary overall dunes narrative sum is hefty and villeneuves chosen path makes sense but ultimately it leans so heavily on the inevitability of sequels that by the films end its easy to feel as if the story is just beginning and it is but there is an unsatisfying hunger that the viewer is left with knowing full well that another entry is years away its the sort of conclusion that would have made most people stand and cheer if another episode was due to air next week alas dune part one is an epic table setting that certainly excites with the prospect of more dense scifi action to come but after a nearly 3hour runtime theres a stark difference between wanting more and deserving more
Feb 10 2023,positive,among my very favorite recent movies
Feb 10 2023,negative,mediocre     very cheesy bombastic flick that is artistically inferior to even the theatrical lynch adaptation that still stands as a baroque scifi masterpiece despite all its editing and production issues     after an underwhelming intro that spoils everything about the fremen from the start were treated to a rather generic marvelesque production quality with a mostly annoying soundtrack that taps into your typical millenial wannabe tribal chants and drums yawn and with far too many zhendaya visions how about pauls visions about him waking up becoming a god and leading the fremen to liberation     this movie is longer than the 1984 adaptation yet tells so much less no padishah emperor here no guild navigators in sight but on the other hand more rambo momoa action than you asked for     chamalets acting is rather wooden if not sleepy as he lacks the passion wisdom and introspection needed for someone like paul atreides one of the things that lynch had totally done right and strangely theres more romance incestuous at that between lady jessica and paul than with her husband duke leto why is that denis     the sountrack by hans zimmer as usual with zimmer is good yet unremarkable all the usual drums and badass fights are covering for too much greyness and uninteresting designs especially for the spaceships like those boringlooking heighliners i was trying to care about or bene gesserit ships that look like yuppie home appliances stellan skarsgard makes for a quite boring archnemesis and the cgi overall feels uninvolving     were far from the magnitude and psychedelia of the first twothree books that also here lynch and brian eno did the effort of expressing    this is a dune for generic yuppie millenials who mate through yoga sessions expensive trance music venues and posh diners downtown likely reflecting the directors and his production teams views and tastes but not getting any broader or more inspiring than this for all the love thrown at villeneuve id say he lacks the ambition such an adaptation deserves    another bigbudget beautifullooking cinematic piece of rubbish
Feb 10 2023,positive,modern movies are universally awful but this one somehow turned out pretty well
Feb 8 2023,positive,great cinematography but half the screenplay is a dior ad the story feels a little dragged out but it is still good maybe far too long
Feb 6 2023,negative,slow and dull looked to be just showing off special effects
Feb 5 2023,positive,incredible  immersive beautiful and captivating  loved the acting performances and the director nailed the tone felt in the novel  amazing action and the undertones and messaging sang through with beautifully delivered metaphors and dramatic cinematography  beautiful movie  most enjoyable viewing in recent years
Feb 4 2023,positive,this movie is so well done in every way every time i watch it i like it more it was a 10 the first time i saw it bravo to the writers director producers actors set design wardrobe so impressive all around sets the right mood in every scene ive read the book and their interpretation is so good i cannot wait to see part 2
Feb 4 2023,positive,awesome visuals soundtrack et characters  pure villeneuve
Feb 3 2023,positive,great movie a little slow sometimes but i really look forward how they continue this
Feb 2 2023,positive,what an achievement this movie is a prime example of what filmmaking is all about
Feb 2 2023,negative,it didnt follow the book and the story was weak and they left out god
Feb 1 2023,positive,i guess it is finelittle long especially in the middle bit
Jan 31 2023,positive,a great but not perfect adaptation of the first two books in the original novel villeneuves artistic and thoughtful approach to creating the dune universe on screen  coupled with strong performances from most of the main cast  makes dune 2021 one of the best movies of the year and one of the best scifi movies in memory part 2 should be even better
Jan 31 2023,positive,dennis villeneuves dune does justice to the classic fictional novel by frank herbert the movie sounds amazing looks fresh and full of modern filmmaking ideas which characterizes villeneuves thoughtprovoking and pioneering approach to cinema
Jan 30 2023,positive,a slow burner but the amount of detail and development you get is enough to keep your attention beautiful visuals
Jan 30 2023,positive,movie was mid not the best but 610 imo
Jan 29 2023,positive,fabulous visuals unique soundtrack amazing action sceneswhats not to like man
Jan 29 2023,positive,dune is a big scifi story of a heros journey to a dangerous planet to ensure the future of his family and his people deserving of a rich treatment and in this regard the 2021 film delivers while the performances are good the most impressive thing is the music and visuals especially around the epic battle scenes although long and slow at times it is worth it for these moments
Jan 28 2023,positive,dune is a decent film it is about a noble family who becomes embroiled in a war for control over the galaxys most valuable asset timothee chalamet and zendaya give good performances the screenplay is a little slow in places dennis villeneuve did an alright job directing this movie i liked this motion picture because of the action and adventure
Jan 27 2023,neutral,i was hoping that this would show 30 more years imagination skill and technical expertise than david lynchs 1984 version but it doesnt lynch was a real visionary who gave us extraordinary visuals in a strange world this latest version doesnt give the viewer any reason to care about any of the characters which is a real shame  and feeling so disconnected i felt i was watching a little skirmish on a spec of dust about thirty million light years away casting josh brolin was a mistake he looks just like any guy next door which detracted from the character much prefer the 1984 epic version
Jan 25 2023,negative,you need to fire james gunn
Jan 25 2023,positive,beautiful movie aesthetically and interesting plot i was on the edge of my seat the entire movie i had high expectations and was not disappointed definitely one youll want to rewatch again and again
Jan 23 2023,positive,there are so many burning contemporary topics compiled and explored in this half century old scifi founding text that the questions of meaning and life are inevetibly asked throughout its never ending reads and rereads and villneuve succeeded in giving this detailed and rich world a dignified immersive visual realisation this is a movie universe i will be part of many years to come i hope
Jan 22 2023,positive,i have to agree with the critics the cinematography is absolutely stunning the beginning is a bit slow but once we get to arrakas its a thrilling cinematic ride that had me on the edge of my airplane seat  watching it on a tiny screen i will see it again and i will find a big screen to watch it on because its too good not to see the full visual effects     the casting left something to be desired but frank herberts story is captivating on multiple levels and the screenwriters and the editors did a fantastic job of pulling together the multiple plot streams into a beautiful symphony of political spiritual and socialpsychological intrigue i gotta see it again and i look forward to dune 2    ps i cant blame david lynch for not watching this version it puts his version to shame
Jan 20 2023,positive,so very basically if you dont like this movie you are probable that kind of person that can enjoy just snyder or bay movies basically your brain cells are not trained to get more than the sparks of an explosion the problem with this film is that this is a masterpiece of great script scenography art direction colours the awesome direction of villeneuve really if you dont like this kind of film no problem just watch the next useless cinecomic and dont waste time on stuff that is too much for you
Jan 19 2023,negative,this movie sucks and so does the acting
Jan 18 2023,negative,horrible horrible movie
Jan 18 2023,positive,a movie with dynamic twists and action sequences that leave you on the edge of your seat sets up a compelling story arc with its foreshadowing more of a setup movie for things to come rather than a standalone film
Jan 18 2023,positive,i really enjoyed the sound and visuals of this movie it made me feel like i was there though they shouldnt have just ended it in the middle of the story in my opinion at least end it with something happening
Jan 17 2023,negative,it had 2 hours of build up and 15 minutes of substance at the end to lead up to a sequel
Jan 17 2023,positive,the movie is great but it has some problems if you already read the book the experience will be better it seems that the end its a cut that something is missing and i could have more character development
Jan 16 2023,negative,i actually fell asleep halfway through this
Jan 15 2023,positive,best scifi movie in years
Jan 14 2023,positive,wow its so amazing love it
Jan 13 2023,positive,despite some miscasts tufir havat and some creative approach to characters kines and jessica this movie comes as close as possible to the book without needing a whole series   one can see how much skarsgård enjoys playing the villain and chalamet is acceptable as paul id really like to see how theyll handle the second part
Jan 13 2023,positive,visually stunning  and the acting is solid and believable  my problem comes with the pacing and sound design  every scene was loud and covered in music leaving no opportunity for rise and fall  this combined with the lack of any coherence between scenes made me feel like i watched hours of video game cut scenes back to back
Jan 13 2023,positive,delicious film that makes your fall in love with the big screen and the genre
Jan 12 2023,positive,although dune does have several slow paced moments that can be quite uninteresting its characters were well built courtesy of its cast
Jan 11 2023,positive,i mean its fine two and a half hours and almost nothing happens not saying the acting isnt good or the effects but i just dont understand what the heck is going on or why it just doesnt compel me not even jason momoa i think the real problem is that its just all over the place and they should have made paul gay if paul was gay it would have been a much better movie
Jan 10 2023,neutral,i can imagine this would be great if youve read the books but i havent so this film pretty much made no sense to me
Jan 8 2023,positive,cant wait for the second part outperformed my expectations
Jan 8 2023,negative,really felt like this movie was made to people that beforehand know the story i was definitely not one of them
Jan 8 2023,positive,best scifi in a long time
Jan 8 2023,positive,they never say the spice must flow but still a good movie
Jan 7 2023,positive,its boring however it is a great movie for boomers and people who like to read books they try to appeal to younger generations by casting my favorite twink mr chalamet along with queen zendaya i literally would not have watched if they werent there good casting i suppose
Jan 7 2023,positive,this imo is a masterpiece of modern scifi i enjoyed every single moment of it
Jan 4 2023,positive,the visuals in this movie were nothing short of spectacular the acting is stier and though the movie approaches 3 hours you never feel the length and the cliffhanger ending leaves your mouth watering for the next addition to this series from some of cinemas best workers the only problem was releasing it on hbo at the same time as theaters because this deserves to be seen on the silver screen
Jan 4 2023,negative,ill be honest up frontim not the best to get advice from on a movie like this these kind of movies are always waaaay over my headits like they make a plot line so hard to understand to impress viewers the technical part of the stratosphere discovers the new planet with scientific pressure and then the naysayers like what just make it easy to understand    the visual effects and cinematography are top notch but i need a plot that actually is spoken in my language to understand
Jan 4 2023,positive,the movie looks like it will start a very popular fantasy story but for me it was for the most part slow paced and uneventful i expect the sequel to be a lot better
Jan 3 2023,positive,overall im highly satisfied with this film  audiences are introduced to a whole new world which is an exciting experience for movie lovers  visually dune cannot be faulted and performances are well suited and enjoyable  the plot again remains somewhat heavy with plenty of information  director denis villeneuve nails this though and i only had a couple of minor issues relating to elements with details or plot  comprehending all the details and the complicated plot could be overwhelming and hard work for selected audiences in the end i was left feeling highly impressed and i wanted more of it like right now
Jan 3 2023,positive,a visual masterpiece rare that a movie does justice to the book this one definitely hits the mark cant wait for pt 2
Jan 2 2023,positive,a masterpiece captivating visuals rich world great characters and outstanding performances
Jan 2 2023,positive,one of the best movies i ever seen its as good as the first star wars i cant wait for part 2
Jan 1 2023,positive,a great adaptation of frank herberts novel it only tells half the story of the first book so the ending will feel like fellowship of the ring its a completed story but there is more to go the cast and visuals add to a great story the baron steals the show
Jan 1 2023,negative,the film was over hyped when it released now watching on sky cinema find it hard to watch cant really understand the story line over 2 hours long im sure i can find other better movies to watch that will make the best use of my precious time definitely wouldnt be watching any further movies on this cant believe that many like this movie must have a different taste to mine especially as i am big movie fanatic dont say i didnt warn you
Dec 30 2022,positive,one of the best movies ever
Dec 30 2022,positive,really enjoyed this adaptation on dune great music score visually stunning and an simple but well executed story that kept me entertained to the end 
Dec 30 2022,positive,i loved the original and wanted to love this but i didnt hate it
Dec 29 2022,negative,trite reworking of the 1984 film which in itself was disappointing but this was far worse  little more than a halfhearted attempt to cover the nuances of frank herberts epic novel instead turning the story into an action movie almost devoid of any character development or depth
Dec 29 2022,positive,a film that you can see more often without losing the fun of it i hope we do not have to wait long for the second part
Dec 28 2022,negative,beautiful cast but too long and too boring
Dec 28 2022,positive,simply one of my favourite movies of all time you can tell this is a passion project for villineuve it shows    this is a movie that gives you more on repeat viewings the lore of the dune universe will make this movie far more enjoyable if you familiarise yourself with it    cant wait for part 2
Dec 28 2022,positive,stunning visuals very good acting and casting takes time to tell the story but never gets boring not many movies like this are being made these days which is a shame i really look forward to part two
Dec 27 2022,positive,i dont know what to say as a hard core dune fan other than well done its impossible to make this into a film i think you are a genius for making it as dune as you did  i withheld half a star only for one reason there was a bit of a drift toward making characters a bit more relatable to gen z but at the same time i understand doing that  i felt reimagining dr kynes did not contribute to the film but detracted from it just because it was such a massive departure from the book  but at the same time its not like it was bad either it was fine and the lady is obviously some highly talented actress  i just think cleaving closer to the film on that would have worked better but again what you did was cool enough    again impossible impossible impossible to make this into a film  very pleased with the very sincere earnestly crafted offering from this director who ive grown to like more and more and from the actors who i feel did very great jobs  very well done
Dec 27 2022,positive,best movie of 2022 in my eyes i love the eery sound production behind denis villeneuves movies if you have a decent surround sound system then his films really do utilise it and you can tell he has passion not only for cinematography but also for sound production all round the acting is pretty solid the special effects are mesmerising and the story is one of the best ever written all that added with the hard punching sound production and perfectly fitting sound track meant that it gave me everything i want from a scifi movie i cannot wait for part two dune will go down as one of the best scifi movies of all time lets hope the sequels are as good
Dec 26 2022,positive,loved it an artful reinterpretation of half the first book amazing cast beautiful visuals may feel a little slow to a modern audience  but i found its pace refreshing and meditative  relieved a second film is on the way
Dec 26 2022,positive,its one of those movies that you just have to see it for the first time in imax 3d    perfect casting for almost all characters and beautiful music its simply must see  its only first fart of the book but its a great movie anywaynext part coming 2023
Dec 26 2022,positive,there is something missing so meeh
Dec 26 2022,positive,slow but not boring enveloping fascinating and creepily beautiful cant wait for the next one
Dec 26 2022,positive,loved the movie waiting for the second one
Dec 25 2022,positive,beautiful scenery cant wait for the sequel
Dec 24 2022,positive,this will be the franchise we show our kids years from now like our parents did to us with star wars
Dec 18 2022,positive,its a wonderful well paced adaptation to a epic novel with excellent acting especially from stellan skarsgård as baron harkonnen
Dec 17 2022,positive,as cold scifi dune is appropriately massive in scope and scale but honors the journey of paul atreides meticulously its as lovingly faithful to the source material as its 2 hr and 35 minrun time allows more a critique of the novel than this adaptation the one thing dune fails to do is show the emotional choice paul atreides makes between following the path set by his bene gesserit mother and embracing the mantel of duke embodied in his noble father
Dec 14 2022,positive,found out the few issues nit picks really there are with the movie originated in the book all around great movie
Dec 14 2022,negative,so slow and stale probably because i saw the original which was colourful and epic  this version had no soul or style it just feltclean and sterile
Dec 13 2022,positive,absolutely incredibly submersive film any dune fans should not miss this rendition of the epic dune story cant wait for the second rendition
Dec 13 2022,positive,beautiful movie the scenes are great the acting is amazing cannot wait for the next one it can be really building to something noteworthy
Dec 12 2022,positive,much better than 1984 version
Dec 12 2022,positive,walking in i found out how long the movie was but i was shocked when it ended visually stunning and even though the novel has many levels and details this production did an excellent job keeping the story cohesive
Dec 11 2022,negative,i dont think ive ever wasted so much time waiting for a movie get good i waited the whole 2 hours and 30 minutes it was baaaad bad maybe people have rated it so highly because they enjoyed the old dune from like 50 years ago and thought it was cool to see it remade but it wasnt not cool at all people talking about the stunning visuals it was mostly sand they were amazing and showing us lots of sand wow the space ships and things ive seen much better on low rated scifi shows so yeah nahh sucky movie soo soo sucky
Dec 9 2022,negative,jesus what a mess i cant believe the 1984 version beats this movie by a long shot    i really had my hopes up after watching the 1984 version and due to reviews and ratings which apparently has nothing to do with the quality of films    this movie couldve been easily shortened to 60 minutes at most nothing there really made me care for the people or the plot just looks and feels like a generic film some of the visuals are ok for a modern film but how on earth did this get such ratings  the costumes are so simple no interesting dialogues the scenes and landscapes look so flat and fake    the 1984 version is exponentially better maybe only few of the visuals there are not as impressive as the 2021 visuals but thats only because they didnt have the technology to make it back then    if you think youve enjoyed the 2021 version i dare you to try the 1984 version and then you will be awakened just like the sleeper did    he who controls the spice controls the universe
Dec 9 2022,positive,this movie is a work of art timothee chalamet is incredible in it a standout by far  this was my introduction to the world of dune i am invested and so existed for part two i am hoping this will begin a beautiful critically acclaimed franchise i can wait to see more from timothee chalamets paul
Dec 7 2022,positive,spectacular visual experience im hooked for the next one if it wasnt for the book which im currently trying to decipher i would have been lost in the details theres a lot that they just leave out there without an explanation but if you take a step back the bigger picture drags you in and gets the adrenaline going
Dec 7 2022,neutral,oh dear  much hyped and looked forward too  disappointing  great visual effects  but acting and characterisation poor  stalwarts of everything  herbert   will not have been taken in  the earlier tv series on scifi  of dune and children of dune is the one to watch  the key to these earlier dune books 13  is chani and irulan  the casting of the young paul  chani and stilgar is awful  the only redeeming feature is the mentat eyes  i cant even bring to mind the face of the doctor  the worms are wrong  basically the film has no heart  one needs to remember the brilliant vision of the herberts and their incredible understanding of the human condition 
Dec 6 2022,positive,my favorite movie of all time it has both amazing visuals and an amazing story the characters are easy to follow and the movie gives you a reason to want to go back to the theater to rewatch it unfortunately its not in the movie theater anymore but when it was i got to experience it firsthand and i can tell you that the movie is the best thing that ive ever seen in the theater also the story and the characters are as goodif not betterthan the book highly recommend
Dec 5 2022,negative,for me this was style over substance the acting was strong but it was as slow as can be and the story went nowhere
Dec 1 2022,positive,i really didnt knew that i liked  in universe politics in movies dune is a movie that i didnt expect to like as much as i do right now this movie was so good that i actually went ahead and read the book  the last time it happened was in lord of the rings the thing that made me want to read the book was the world building the world building is really important and it feels like a universe even though we dont see other planets unlike the 1984 movie where they say only 4 planets matter which makes the world feel small this movie has moments which makes dune dune the characters also make good decisions and act like wise individuals there are some things that are whacky like how they didnt set up doctor yeuh and the ending just ends without any sort of conclusion maybe they should have focused on the fact that paul doesnt kill like in the book like batman and in the end he realises with these hallucinations that he has to kill to survive which would have been a much better ending one thing that i noticed is that how certain things are showed as a twist compared to the book the book just says the yeuh twist and the harkonnens destroying the atreides and the gurney halleck being alive twist in this its more like a twist and yes of course i am not going to about the movie without talking about its amazing cinematography the shots are really good the acting is good oscar isaac as duke leto is the best choice and this movie only adapts the least interesting part of the movie and i cant imagine what the next movie would be like 910
Nov 30 2022,positive,alright so much going on here incredible cast mid character interaction a superb score topnotch special effects amazing plot disappointing pace 87100 definitely watching again super stoked for part 2 too bad we have to wait like 3 years hope they dont ruin the sequel cant get over this cast truly incredible just wish they would have fit more of the plot of the first book in and i wish so many great characters didnt die so soon but its faithful to the book so i cant really complain overall incredible movie shoulda made wayyyyy more money than it did great booktoscreen translation
Nov 30 2022,positive,cant wait for part 2 
Nov 30 2022,positive,a true cinematic and auditory experience i enjoyed and visual fx audio fx and the story tellling of course a lot
Nov 28 2022,positive,much better than the 1984 adaptation this movie benefits from splitting the source material into multiple parts because more time could be spent with a scene or character it does a good job explaining the rules of the duniverse without overwhelming visually the movie is absolutely gorgeous
Nov 28 2022,positive,movie definitely is one of the greatest films of the decade and it doesnt surprise me how much of a hit it was however i feel like the only problem with it was that the movie was a little too stretched out when the whole movie couldve been only twenty minutes shorter
Nov 27 2022,negative,like the score that crescendoes throughout this movie is overwrought and for that reason pretty but empty
Nov 27 2022,positive,so much like star wars and lord of the rings makes this movie just amazing
Nov 27 2022,positive,the best movie score ever composed with the best editing ever done in a movie plus the best cinematography ever done in a movie also the best production design ever made in a movie not to mention the best sound mixing ever done in a movie as well as the best sound editing ever done in a movie and the best visual effects ever made in a movie
Nov 26 2022,positive,if you like science fiction films this is pretty much a must see it is a very good film in two parts this being the first half which i think i appreciated more the second time i watched it this is a major blockbuster but i still feel for the original from 1984 which affects my judgement on this later version a wellacted well designed film
Nov 26 2022,positive,im not usually a fan of slow dramas but this one builds a world and builds to the conflict with competency its beautiful and well done im not even a fan of the books or previous movie but this was very well done
Nov 25 2022,positive,just watch it your only disappointment will be when you realize how long of a wait you have until the next movie in the series
Nov 25 2022,neutral,i like this movie but i feel like a person who need more because i want to see more zendaya she dont show up enough and this make me sad because i love her and admire
Nov 25 2022,positive,so here we are with another attempt to make a feature length film of frank herberts dune one of the biggest scifi novels that has left massive impact on the genre   this time its in the hands of denis villeneuve who took a brave move by making this dune the first part of the book before part 2 even been given the go ahead  my personal opinion is dune is glorious from the sound design  to the visuals which are immense the hans zimmer score is great  the score for the house atreides landing on arrakis is brilliant  grabs you when the bagpipes kicks in during the battle
Nov 24 2022,positive,nice adaptation by denis villeneuve accompanied great cinematography nicely done
Nov 24 2022,positive,very good one of the best movies of 2022  great acting great characters amazing graphics and cgi work  fighting scenes were spectacular war scenes were big screen and the lore and world creation was brilliant bravo fully non woke as well  cheers to that
Nov 23 2022,negative,this movie is an eternal waiting for something that never arrives very frustrating
Nov 20 2022,positive,masterpiece in every aspect a perfect movie
Nov 16 2022,positive,great adaptation of the most epic science fiction book ever written
Nov 16 2022,positive,might be too long honestly but its still a banger
Nov 15 2022,positive,the music and the effects are amazing the story wavers a bit but overall its a very good adaptation
Nov 12 2022,positive,undeniably lush the story of a young kingsavior who struggles with his destiny is certainly old testament meets game of thrones and dune does a descent job of creating a movie of action pieces and characters that you want to watch  but unfortunately between the semiconscious story development sleepy direction and underwhelming tension this is an epic  miss  why not spend as much time on the plot and character development as the production design   see instead blade runner the empire strikes back
Nov 11 2022,positive,is there anything wrong with this film its biggest criticism was that it was slow slow who cares if it hadnt taken the time to include as much of the vast detail of herberts world that it could it would have felt rushed and incomplete aside from that the acting directing and cinematography are beautiful and hans zimmers soundtrack is absolutely spectacular
Nov 11 2022,positive,loved it i hope there will be another one coming out
Nov 10 2022,positive,a masterpiece music pictures lands cape cgi actors and costumes amazing
Nov 9 2022,positive,extremely well paced sensory experience with one of the best soundtracks running behind brilliant camera work hard to go wrong with this thrilling scifi
Nov 7 2022,positive,all i can say is part 2 cant get here soon enough
Nov 6 2022,positive,loved it bit of information overload but still amazing dune is not an easy undertaking but denis did a pretty bang up job in my opinion i watched this movie 3 times and loved each second of it
Nov 3 2022,positive,great adaptation of a great book cant wait for the second part thoroughly enjoyed as a big fan of dune friends who did not know anything about dune before the movie also loved it
Nov 2 2022,negative,weird movie with no ending
Nov 2 2022,positive,this is the first time writing a review i read the first book while in junior collage and loved it watching the movie now 8 years later brings so many good memories they captured alot of details from the book and i say this is one of the best adaptations from any book ive read  stunning scenery costumes great actors 55
Nov 2 2022,positive,brilliant i looked forward to the second movie this movie keeps telling its story throughout
Nov 2 2022,positive,the story is hard to follow if youre not paying again but the graphics are the best ive ever seen and the story and cinematography is on point
Nov 1 2022,positive,master piece this is the first time in my life i have watched a movie 4 times in a week fantastic visual effect and background music
Oct 31 2022,neutral,its a beautiful movie but way too long
Oct 29 2022,positive,visually striking epic a film that is bold enough not to be complacent with the public artful crafted the first time i saw it in 3d and i have to admit that the 3d is bad really bad see it in 2d if they ever rescreen it in theaters  the dialogues are intriguing  the characters deep  the technology is credible  you feel the depth and the details of a really existing universe and civilization  the dreamlike narrative is really appropriate  the acting is incredible  i hope they will preserve it at the smithsonian  people in year 2400 should see it and they will find it amazing and so will you and so must you
Oct 27 2022,positive,amazing masterpiece that builds out a whole new world properly makes star wars from a star wars fan look like a cheap knock off
Oct 27 2022,positive,denis villeneuve has pulled off a truly spectacular piece of cinematic film making with dune everything from the cinematography to the score to the incredible sweeping landscapes and rich lore and backstory that stays true to the source material i can only hope that the film does well enough in the theater so we can see this truly epic story come to conclusion
Oct 26 2022,positive,denis villeneuve is an amazing director and dune just so happens to be my favorite thing like ever so my anticipation for this movie was immeasurable and let me say this movie is an actual masterpiece from a visual perspective this movie is probably the most beautiful film ever that ive seen based on this directors other works you would expect nothing less from eye catching angle the story itself is articulated so expertly that i cant begin to describe it it adapts the story of dune in the best way possible and i really dont see any issues with it the only issue anyone has with this movie was that no one knew if a sequel would come out to finish it but i am writing this in october of 2022 so since that knowledge is given to me i can safely say that this masterpiece is simply a 1010
Oct 25 2022,positive,best adaptation of dune by far however  why oh why does there have to be a two year wait for part two
Oct 24 2022,positive,the scope of the film is impressive as are the visual effects and score really no complaints here
Oct 23 2022,positive,an epic and deeply immersive cinematic experience that hooks you in and leaves you dying for the sequel i would most definitely recommend it
Oct 23 2022,positive,this is the movie ive been waiting for i been a great mmm big fan of this story and that did an excellent job with this movie cant wait for part ii
Oct 23 2022,positive,masterpiece quality and emotions that become poetry on the big screen a colossal work in acting directing editing cinematography production design everything is perfect finally a new colossal movie and epic picture for years
Oct 22 2022,positive,this is a masterpiece in science fiction it excels in drama action plot story telling and scenery denis villeneuve has out done himself kudos to his team and much respect to him for respecting the lore and books those reviewers that complain about the pacing are probably the same people that are addicted to the now 6 second tiktok or youtube shorts online this movie is fantastic the build up is magnificent and i love the sound effects and music bravo
Oct 22 2022,positive,respectful and intelligent adaptation of herberts novel  great spectacle and performances
Oct 21 2022,positive,dune occasionally struggles with its unwieldy source material but those issues are largely overshadowed by the scope and ambition of this visually thrilling adaptation
Oct 21 2022,positive,villeneuve manages to make the film engaging despite its uninteresting lore it has low rewatch value the fight scenes are terrible you cant feel the force punch or stab in all fights which is disappointing since blade runner 2049 has very effective fight scenes
Oct 21 2022,positive,a teenage dream to metamorphose frank herberts futureshock epic into cinematic resplendence denis villeneuve and hans zimmer convey us into a darkling geomorphology of desert warfare spicy mirage and duels of superpowers with their mindbending narrative visuals and score
Oct 19 2022,positive,went into the theater with no idea what the plot was nor that it was a remake loved it similar movies as this one sometimes frustrate me due to not having prior understanding of the charactersplot but dune kept me tuned in the whole time any questions i had just kept me watching to find out cant wait to see part 2
Oct 18 2022,positive,when dune part two arrives this twoparter of a scifi epic is sure to become a modern classic
Oct 17 2022,negative,not a reader of the books but heres my review really wanted to like this movie with the stellar cast acting visual effects and an interesting concept those parts this movie does exceptionally well however pace was painfully slow a lot of confusing moving pieces and by the end of this long movie i wasnt really sure what was so groundbreaking about what was just watched
Oct 16 2022,positive,it does make compromises regarding the source material but they are understandable the grandiose look and atmosphere speaks for itself as it guides you into this new world and universe whose sequel we will look forward to
Oct 15 2022,positive,a fully realised film of the book  superb
Oct 15 2022,positive,exactly what i wanted from a dune movie
Oct 15 2022,positive,this is the adaptation weve been waiting for for 50 years the only way to successfully tell this story is to do it in a twopart film and this is an excellent setup to part two i cant wait until it comes out  villeneuve succeeds where lynch failed in so many ways lets get one thing out of the way at the very beginning no weirding modules using hand signals and subtitles instead of inner monologue was a nice touch as well  the acting was superb having only ever seen oscar isaac in the star wars sequels i was shocked at the depth of character he was able to put into duke leto jason mamoa was the perfect duncan idaho i would have liked to have seen the scene where he is drunk on spice beer and i can easily believe him to be one of the most feared warriors in the imperium timothée chalamet like matthew broderick in the previous generation was able to convincingly pull off a younger character well enough so that the audience forgets the actors actual age   one of the only issues i have with the film is the treatment of the redoubtable and dangerous lady jessica the number of times she is portrayed as merely fearful and seemingly not in control of herself was insulting to the character as written in the novel i dont blame this on the actress rebecca ferguson whom i feel did an amazing job with what she was given i put this at the feet of the director  and even this has a caveat her character may toughen up in the next installment
Oct 13 2022,positive,it was ok i guess just watch the 1984 version its better not sure why hollywood has to remake so many classic movies that still hold their own lazy
Oct 12 2022,positive,if there was someone up to the task of building the world of dune it was denis villaneuve everything from world building cinematography directing and character development was on point i am looking forward to the second part
Oct 11 2022,positive,this movie is a work of art the acting is perfect it was incredible how they adapted such a noncinematic source material and made it one of the most cinematic movies of the 21st century the story is amazing as well and was adapted albeit imperfectly rather well for a 600 page novel over 60 years old dune is the book that inspired so much of scifi that we know and love today you must watch this movie and you must read the book and if you want to learn good storytelling study them
Oct 10 2022,positive,admittedly i have been a huge fan of the book since i read it as a teenager in addition im a bit of a science fiction nut i didnt think that the scope of the book would translate into film however this is the best bloody thing ive seen in years brilliant much better than the previous version better than my own imagination cant wait for part 2 and hopefully part 3 however if you are unfamiliar with the original book the plot would be confusing cant rave enough about how much i enjoyed it
Oct 10 2022,positive,this is one of those movies you hold off watching due to hollywood messing up so many new versions of classic movies and shows then you watch it and walk around the house for a week saying god dammit i could have watched this ages ago  its near perfect
Oct 7 2022,positive,very true to book adaptation with little room for imagination occasionally shows the power of the novel but will have to wait for pt2 to confirm worth the watch alright
Oct 5 2022,positive,never seen or read dune before i sat down in the theatre to watch this movie and ive had the wildest experience that evening the score the visuals the incredible story the characters gave me goosebumps and i was completely in awe   i loved how slow building it was  it  really felt like i was watching a written book which i like since then ive openly told anyone that this is my favourite movie of all time
Oct 3 2022,positive,i absolutely love that theyve refreshed the dune series and i am so anxious to see what they will do with the whole dune universe i was truly blown away
Sep 30 2022,positive,beautiful filmography quite true to the source good actors
Sep 29 2022,positive,atreides atreides atreides this excellent warrior chant echoed in my ears when i viewed dune in the imax for the third time my heart was beating for every twist and turn throughout the film the fact that i knew what was happening with the coup and the sudden fall of house atreides kept me frustrated and excited for the upcoming battle of arrakeen pauls journey is quite impressive and engaging in the grand scheme of what makes dune such a cinematic and written masterpiece i am looking forward to part 2 the cast looks absolutely amazing hans zimmers epic score is saved on my spotify library i would like to let denis villeneuve that i love his work and courage in building up such a wonderful film i love the book so much and believe that even the smallest dream can forge large accomplishments thank you denis villeneuve and good luck with dune part 2 i must not fear fear is the mindkiller
Sep 28 2022,positive,much better than the 1984 version this one makes the smart decision to split the story in two to give it all room to breathe  the result is an epic visually stunning movie with strong performances  its held back from greatness by a few effects that come off looking cheap and an anticlimactic ending  heres hoping part 2 nails the ending
Sep 27 2022,positive,my new favorite movie of all time they were very true to the book and brought it to life brilliantly for the first time ever
Sep 27 2022,negative,loud music week dialog bad plot
Sep 27 2022,positive, ratings categories   characters 910  cinematography 1010  plot 810  acting 1010  pacing 8510  91
Sep 26 2022,positive,very good movie with an awesome cast intrigued to see where this goes next
Sep 25 2022,positive,i cannot believe the high scores not as good as the original version actors not as good and there is sorta this lukewarm atmosphere that pervades this remake s0metimes originals no matter how dated outshine the modern sophisticated remakes ie king kong the thing etc
Sep 24 2022,positive,visually stunning and beautiful sound make for a masterpiece in todays cinema chalamet centers this movie with an incredible performance the supporting cast makes this movie even better ferguson skarsgård isaac zendaya
Sep 24 2022,positive,see plenty of the dune tv shows and movies and so far this was the best and well done  enjoyed the books and read a good way through the series
Sep 22 2022,positive,possibly one of the best made pieces of cinema this century
Sep 21 2022,negative,the story is a little boring and very confusing most of the characters are uninteresting i tried to get invested into the world and story but its not for me other than that the visuals are amazing and the score is beautiful
Sep 21 2022,negative,probably the worst movie i have ever seen hard to understand and the runtime is so long not worth the watch in my opinion
Sep 20 2022,positive,there are two things that make this movie the best film of 2022 the visual effects and the story denis villeneuve deserves a knighthood for the cgi because the visuals were absolutely perfect complementing that is the movies riveting storyline that sees a political struggle between the emperor house atreides and house harkonnens over the known universes most important commodity  if youre into star wars then your definitely going to enjoy this one a highly recommended movie for those who love political dramas and scifis
Sep 18 2022,positive,i dont know what the hell i just watched but i was thoroughly entertained
Sep 18 2022,positive,epic dune is finally here
Sep 17 2022,positive,the artistry accomplished with visual production impacts your emotions on a subconscious level  truly amazing
Sep 17 2022,positive,way better than the 1984 film i was honestly blown away just by how good this movie is i loved it and i am totally down for part two
Sep 16 2022,positive,first big film ive enjoyed in a long time great structure tone and epic scale
Sep 14 2022,positive,incredible complex characters that develop over the course of the movie great introduction to a complicated world that doesnt compromise the source material i watched this twice in a row the first time i saw it and still couldnt wait to see it again fantastic music cant wait for part 2
Sep 14 2022,positive,truly epic from beginning to end it detached me from reality for a moment in time i can see why it might be slow paced for some people but i think for this movie it worked it needed a slow burn to be enjoyed definitely left me wanting more and im eager to see part 2
Sep 13 2022,positive,it was a fantastic movie great action and it was enjoyable on all fronts i like long runtime movies and most people would say its a slow burn which it is but its nice to watch a movie that actually takes time to establish its environment and the characters within it
Sep 13 2022,positive,completely faithful to the text and spirit of the book highly recommend a must see
Sep 12 2022,positive,stunning visually but the story is horrible but then again the story was horrible in the books too
Sep 12 2022,positive,i thought they didnt make movies like this any more i have read the novel several times and i thought there was no way that a movie adaptation could ever do it justice i am happy to report that i was wrong this is a magnificent adaptation i had goosebumps all the way through    this is the movie i wish i could see for the first time again pure cinematic bliss    the spice must flow
Sep 12 2022,positive,great cinematography excellent soundtrack solid acting and appealing plot definetly worth watching and rewatching
Sep 11 2022,positive,a good movie but if the leave it just with this then its bad for the source material because it leaves a lot of things open
Sep 11 2022,negative,having read the books the 2020 film version is an overly long unexplained mostly booring film i know the cash box is the driver of this 2 or 3 part series because the 1984 film is a much better film over all and especially for the first time dune viewer
Sep 11 2022,positive,somewhat a slow buildup but the storyline gradually encourages one to appreciate it visual effects were believable and storyline thankfully unpredictable for first time watchers
Sep 11 2022,positive,wow how incredibly involved and well donespooky intensecreative beyond definition of what is reality
Sep 10 2022,positive,its some kind of unspeakable wonder the soundtrack the landscapes
Sep 9 2022,positive,loved the pacing and story telling classic scifi
Sep 9 2022,positive,epic scale and beutifully filmed dune crafts a rich and exciting world for the audience dreams are messages from the deep
Sep 8 2022,positive,by far the best adaptation of the book im looking forward to watching the next part
Sep 7 2022,positive,this is such a great start to the dune universe im not an expert on the lore but the way this movie introduces all the concepts is textbook for any scifi fantasy it got a little confusing near the end but was still entertaining enough and actionpacked to be an excellent movie
Sep 7 2022,positive,loved it  sad when it ended eagerly await part 2
Sep 7 2022,positive,its better scifi i liked it a couple of minuses for me was not understandinghearing the dialogue at times mumbling not enunciating well and keeping track of the story lines and characters its a film i would need to see twice or three times to fully grasp i think i would not mind watching it several times
Sep 6 2022,positive,i was transported i went to see it in imax because this is what villeneuve suggested but i should have gone and seen it in dolby to fully appreciate the genius soundtrack lesson for dune part 2
Sep 6 2022,positive,the movie takes a lot of risks by having its first acts being mainly a series of contemplative and cold scifi vignettes its beautiful to watch and the music brings emotions the dialogue are short but there is a lot to absorb in terms of lore and storyline too long maybe but you know that once every pieces of the story will be at its place the movie will reach its paroxysm and i am happy to say that it really gets it right the last act takes your breath away with surprising action scenes that always keep the artistic sense that the first parts of the movie used to the viewers that being said yes the movie is beautiful with spectacular pictures and meaningful style but the color palette that its mostly hues of beige will bore you by the end of dune
Sep 6 2022,positive,its a pretty good movie i guess fantastic looking and all but somehow i couldnt feel much sympathy for the most characters but i didnt read the books so maybe its meant that way to create a harsh and distanced world maybe just not completely my taste i loved the depiction of the baron harkonnen only to see him move like this evil slug again i will see the second part
Sep 6 2022,positive,audio effects of this movie sets whole new benchmark
Sep 6 2022,positive,dunes reboot is both better and an improvement over the original that even if its own set of problems have faults its still a satisfying film with its special effects
Sep 6 2022,positive,spectacular incredible and well done superior to lynchs movie
Sep 6 2022,positive,breathtaking well written great acting
Sep 5 2022,positive,this film gets 4 stars for cinematic visual quality and not putting me to sleep if you know dune a remake was needed but not attempted because as of yet there is no way to accurately recreate the world in the books also the last attempt which was good just was to lengthy and the graphics where just not there yet the rendition looked amazing the acting compelling my major disappointment no zendaya well just 10 mins at most at the endsorry spoiler  the mystery of life isnt a problem to solve but a reality to experience  ee
Sep 5 2022,positive,i watched it for its visual effects
Sep 5 2022,positive,im a fan of dune have read all the dune books and short stories and was worried this wouldnt live up to its source material wow was i wrong this film captures the sweeping splendor of frank herberts universe and adds some small twists that make certain characters and familiar storylines even more dramatic love it recommend this one to all science fiction fans
Sep 5 2022,positive,acting was amazing didnt think there was bad acting from anyone the cinematography was unbelievable and the cgi was top tier everything looked and felt real the story was interesting even the political parts which most movies completely fail at
Sep 5 2022,negative,it is a movie that would not deserve any comment if it did not reflect all the vanity and downturn in which todays film industry has gone from the director of the interesting arrival 2016 through the failed blade runner 2049 2017 denis villeneuve we came to an impersonal remake of a much better achievement from 1984    no need to spend too much words on the analysis of this work because it seems that the story itself did not even interest the authors much a simple recipe copy everything that has already been filmed stretch the already maximally compressed script to two or three potential sequels pump in as large a budget as possible for cgi effects insert a few actors jason momoa dave bautista and josh brolin who would otherwise be ok if they werent here only just for decoration in order to push up the ratings a little more with the antipathetic and completely wrongly chosen main protagonists who all together sadly failed    the individual reassignment of genderethnicity of the minor characters from the book is not too irritating although such choices are for some strange or perhaps not reason somehow always at the expense of quality so they are still irritating because they are imposed by the way if the socalled gender and any other equality in cinema has already become the manner of the new age it is interesting that no one ever replaces any original female character for a male one if only as an experiment i guess that would require a certain amount of originality and courage qualities that are no longer appreciated by modern directors    after watching this adaptation it is only possible to love more the controversial 1984 lynchs version which despite all the imperfections still remains superior in every sense i mean of course the shorter original version not the integral which is much weaker    the only positive thing that can be said about this film is that unlike eg the longannounced foundation series which is a much bigger disaster in itself at least holds the original story and in any case at least it doesnt come down to purchase of the title of some famous work in order to push someones other untalented generic script for a story that no one else would ever look at  all in all a small consolation
Sep 5 2022,positive,superb cinematography and a visual overload of movie mastery denis villeneuve delivers once again a cult classic in the making cant wait for part 2
Sep 4 2022,positive,so close to the dune that i want to see on screen but not quite there  still its a wonderful movie that has me waiting for the sequel
Sep 4 2022,positive,when villeneuve comes out with a film you know its gonna get wild    the sense of scale that denis is able to produce is just mindboggling and he retains his class the whole time    it wasnt until the second viewing though that i discovered what made me feel weirdly confused and dissatisfied after the first viewing   it was the simple fact that the whole story plot character introductions and largely the whole worldbuilding is all being told as if you already are familiar with it   im guessing that if id read the books before watching id feel respected and as though denis gave a little nod of you know what all this is about   so thats why the second viewing actually was an amplified experience from the first since all details of story and plot were settled and i had the time to capture more of the deeper meanings and thoughts behind the different scenes    wonderfully tasteful and patient storytelling without losing a single fucking second of pacing fucking astonishing
Sep 4 2022,positive,as a great fan of herbets books villeneuve made the perfect adaptation hans zimmer is as its top and actors performance is absolutely relevant
Sep 4 2022,positive,waiting for part 2  the suspense is nerving
Sep 4 2022,positive,pretty good fantastic visuals the story is a bit slow but intelligent and compelling
Sep 4 2022,positive,pretty good   enjoyed watching a classic movie with original performances
Sep 4 2022,negative,slow boring and never fully understood without having seen it about 5 times highly overrated
Sep 3 2022,positive,cant wait for the other parts fingers crossed we get the complete book series
Sep 3 2022,negative,dune is an expensive art film that stripped the soul out of the source material the director turned what should have been an action film in to a plodding bore the film was horribly miscast timothee chalamets hamlet version of paul caused chain reaction problem in the story many scenes had to be added to account for the change of paul from a strong leader who has been trained since birth to step into his fathers shoes as duke into a total wimp the novel has very little opening material that takes place on caladan while the film lingers there pointlessly at the same time scenes that advance the story in the novel were omitted the one positive thing is the film looks good and has stunning visuals if youre the kind of person who likes mindless comic book films with no plot you might like dune if you are denis villeneuve fanboy youll certainly love dune
Sep 3 2022,positive,true to the spirit of the book this movie is a loveletter to the books and is a mustsee for anyone that likes a story welltold and wellfilmed
Sep 3 2022,positive,having read the book which at first i assumed it was not adaptable however this movie does it well and gives us context about the fiction the score is totally unique much like the duniverse itself i think this is the best possible adaptation of frank herberts dune
Sep 3 2022,positive,unlike previous adaptations this one gives lady jessica the screen time she deserves outstanding adaptation of the book ends at an odd moment in my opinion
Sep 3 2022,positive,just a masterpiece combination of narrative visuals and score
Sep 3 2022,positive,great i went in with low expectations as an old reader but this was just brilliant cant wait for part 2
Sep 3 2022,positive,this is an absolutely stunning adaptation of the original material it will be hard for some to follow because they made the decision to do without an internal monologue which the older movie used to help the audience understand the nuances of the story and the characters    my only criticism is the lady jessica the quality of the acting was excellent but i think that the way the character is portrayed is such a departure from the books that it actually disrupts the story a bit she is too emotional too fearful    other than that absolutely spot on even with some minor changes
Sep 3 2022,positive,like jacksons lotr trilogy its not perfect but clearly honors and respects the source material  denis villeneuve is developing a distinct engrossing visual style that alone is a treat to watch  but pacing story costumes effects and acting are all great  fingers crossed for dune 2 to bring it home  will make it the defining dune adaptation for a very long time to come
Sep 2 2022,positive,while much of the runtime is spend on world building what a fascinating world it is it does indeed feel like the first half of a story because thats precisely what it is once the second film releases i can easily imagine the full picture becoming some of the best 56 hours of scifi ever put to film i am also a fan of all 6 frank herbert novels and hope they are able to do justice to dune messiah  children of dune if they decide to adapt them i hope jason momoa realizes what he signed up for
Sep 2 2022,positive,cant wait for part 2
Sep 2 2022,positive,solid  it is always refreshing when there is a respectful and welldone adaptation of one of your favorite books
Sep 2 2022,negative,this movie demonstrates the accomplishment of some great outcomes yet most of it cant be appreciates because the dialogue can rarely be followed i couldnt finish watching the film because the audio was handled so badly which now seems to be largely the norm in these modern films exacerbating this is the particularly unintelligible performance by timothée chalamet which demonstrated the he too believes that great emotion is demonstrated through the obfuscation of the dialogue every time he wants to show emotion it seems like he has never had a real emotion in his life he seems to think screaming gurgling and mumbling is a fair enough representation of feeling
Aug 31 2022,positive,amazing you can tell the director loves the book cant wait for part 2
Aug 31 2022,positive,i did not read the book nor see the original movie but this version was great
Aug 30 2022,negative,two stars for the sound designmusic and the photos  the rest is an empty shell  i like denis villeneuve a lot but some stuff are supposed to remain on paper
Aug 30 2022,negative,i can see how people liked the film because of the sound and scenery but thats about it zero explaining on most of the backstory slow beginning slow middle and rushed end half the time i didnt know why things were happening or the reason behind it i just dont understand what all the fuss is over as i can barely class this as a movie as it didnt have any sort of storytelling in it  a start middle and something which was meant to be an ending
Aug 30 2022,neutral,slow  ok movie but very very slow
Aug 29 2022,positive,i am a kid of the eightys having grown up with films partially older like me like star wars and the first adaption of dune while leaving an impact it never took real hold especially after reading the book hearing there would be a new adaption by villeneuve i read it again and had no big hopes because the source seemed just too complex to be adapted for the big screen nevertheless i gave it a chance and surprise it dit not only held up to any possible expectations it blew them right out of the cinema i am not sure if i ever have seen an sf movie even close to this ambition and scope it all checks out the vision the cinematography the music the actors i am more than maiting for part 2 probably never was waiting for a movie as much as for this one advice choose a screen as big as possible and turn the volume up see you in the dunes waiting for the sandworm taking us to part 2
Aug 29 2022,positive,damn this movie is a freaking masterpiece
Aug 29 2022,positive,feels like a ridley scott movie baron harkonnen is a pale version compared to the one in 1984 and why in heavens name are we glorifying desert cultures was probably cool and novel back in 1965 but not anymore was it inspired by watching lawrence of arabia make it out in space and you have a hit also not a big fan of one name celebrities oh and the dragonflies are flights of imagination could you imagine the carnage landing in a crowd
Aug 28 2022,negative,i didnt like this movie and i found it so confusing i am a timothee fan so i though that this movie was gonna be good but tbh its not my thing but maybe dune 2 i gonna be better
Aug 27 2022,negative,movie ends on an unnecessary cliffhanger also why did the asian doctor have to die in such a gruesome way
Aug 27 2022,positive,amazing in every way really looking forward to part 2
Aug 27 2022,positive,hands down one of the best movies to be released within the past 10 years the characters have a depth that is quickly realized absolutely beautiful cinematography the story takes itself seriously which allows the viewer to feel the weight of decisions made and their succeeding consequences i can not wait for the sequel
Aug 26 2022,neutral,great effects and sound but not as good as i thought for all the hype i was expecting a lot more 
Aug 25 2022,positive,what a fantastic movie i had no knowledge of the dune universe before seeing this and i thoroughly enjoyed myself it is a fun world that denis does a good job of fleshing out the story itself is interesting and the visuals of this movie are amazing cinematography is a 1010 movie is a massive recommend
Aug 24 2022,positive,the best movie ive seen released 2021  and one of the best i have seen for a long time full stop  simply stunning grand and to those who wish to criticise pull your heads in  watched 3 times in less than 2 months i couldnt help but treat myself absolute gold  how a movie should be  epic  if you enjoyed the early 2000s original release you will totally piddle your pants end of story  cannot wait til part 2  thank you directors producers actors and crew be proud  sen mf sational
Aug 24 2022,positive,a beautiful film with amazing music and visuals for those familiar with the books or earlier film it may seem strangely boring as this adaptation has not much more to offer than its spectacle rather than story
Aug 23 2022,positive,to me dune series is the bilble of sociopolitics religious politics and a whole bunch of other kinds of human wisdom thus i cant really forgive skipping the feast in arrakeen or the missing green chamber    this film reminds me to not pay too much attention to trailers the trailers suggested another 2020s woke disaster which this film is not yes kynes was made into a black woman but his role does not get ruined by it and this way all the woke checkboxes got compressed into the single scapegoat who was already the perfect candidate through being a planetologist    my inner dune jihadi scoffs at the softened atreides the rest enjoys it humans in the dune universe are already somewhat different from us no need to overfocus on that    the actress chosen to play chani by method of woke checkboxes could not deliver the original whose savagery hides behind an elfin face and who fancies paul from the start again an acceptable casualty since she was never an arank toon while kynes alone would not have appeased the wokeness committee    all in all my feeling is that this as good as a 2020s adaptation of a classic work can have any remote chance to be theres hoping the crew noticed the winds of change in wbnetflix stories and part 2 will bow even less to the nazis and instead just continue telling one of the most compelling scifi stories ever written
Aug 22 2022,positive,the visuals were stunning but i ultimately got very bored in the end
Aug 21 2022,positive,huge fan of the books and previous movie the first 20 minutes of this film and i knew this was something i would watch over and over it is different and i love it amazing filmography gorgeous casting was spot on
Aug 21 2022,positive,directorscreenwriter denis villenueve blade runner 2049 arrival is a perfect fit for a story like dune  villeneuve has consistently crafted films that are captivatingly immersive cinematic experiences sometimes short on story but always visually spectacular  this dune offers truly breathtaking visuals  in fact its the best reason currently available for actually heading out to the movies  films like this can be best experienced only in a dark room with a huge screen lightly populated with sociallydistanced strangers who have turned off their cell phones im looking at you row g    villenueve along with cowriters eric roth and jon spaihts has created a mesmerizing world for the moviegoer to inhabit  house atriedes longtime rulers of caladan a world filled with rainy days fog and lush beauty  think seattle but a planet is ordered by the emperor to take control of arrakis known as dune a barren wasteland of strategic importance because of the hallucinogenic spice harvested there  spice is essential to interstellar travel life extension and a variety of medical uses all of which make it the most valuable substance in the world  turns out house harkonnen previous ruler of the planet isnt thrilled to give up this lucrative enterprise  treachery abounds  the leader of house atriedes is murdered  the heir paul atriedes barely escapes but is abandoned to wander in the desert just in case the messianic overtones were too subtle    although this film runs over 2 ½ hours it covers only the first half of frank herberts original novel by the same name  even at this length creating a coherent narrative is a major achievement  in contrast in the 1970s chilean surrealist alejandro jadorowsky created story boards for an epic film version of dune with a running time of over ten hours  astonishingly hollywood wasnt interested  it would have starred an amazing collection of characters including orson welles salvador dali mick jagger david carradine herve villachaize the diminutive tattoo on fantasy island and gloria swanson  the lead would have been jadorowskys twelveyearold son  if youre interested watch the 2013 documentary jadorowskys dune    villenueves script has stripped away the pretentious overtones and general bloviating of frank herberts novel  the original novel is a piece of work in every possible sense  running to more than 550 pages it was originally serialized in analog magazine before being published by the littleknown chilton books a publishing house best known for its car repair manuals  herbert himself spent time in a socialist commune in washington state as a child  he was also a distant relative of joseph mccarthy and admired his relations goals if not his methods  to suggest that his views are eclectic is to engage in serious understatement    all this means that villeneuve had to effectively navigate a dizzying range of topics that include ecology psychedelic drugs religion featuring the bene gesserit  think extremely badass spacetraveling nuns authoritarianism and actual human emotion   he succeeds for many reasons  first rather than spouting philosophy he focuses on building a big farreaching spectacle that literally encompasses a universe second he has an impeccable eye for casting  in this case hes selected timothee chalamet little women call me by your name as the messianic son paul atriedes rebecca ferguson mission impossible series the greatest showman as his bene gesserit mother oscar isaac ex machina the card counter as leader of the atriedes clan and a supporting cast that includes jason momoa stellan skarsgard josh brolin javier bardem and zendaya  all inhabit their roles perfectly  finally villenueve understands that big ideas can arise and be considered without the need for mindnumbing exposition thats right mr herbert or tidy resolution    dune has admirers from a surprisingly broad array of political perspectives from stephen colbert to white supremacists attracted to the idea of a white messiah figure  since its publication in 1965 herberts weirdly compelling world has offered a welcome respite from the real  it offers a similarly welcome thoughtprovoking diversion today
Aug 20 2022,positive,an amusing and fantastically present feat on all fronts lays out a foundational adventure not only in action but amuses the mind in all ways as well the stellar cast perfectly brewed together enhance the storytelling presented
Aug 19 2022,positive,great movie a little slow at times but still very good
Aug 18 2022,neutral,despite the throbbing score of its trailer dune is a film that waddles in the footsteps of its older brother majestic and intentional yet careful and forgettable
Aug 17 2022,positive,great watch needed more action story line was ok
Aug 17 2022,positive,it all amazing the acting the writing and especially the visual effects  i think its the best movie to come out this year
Aug 15 2022,positive,the best movie in the last decade nothing else to say  1010
Aug 14 2022,positive,brilliant movie with stunning shots and beautiful soundtrack
Aug 14 2022,positive,i just want to wait here until the next movie comes out said a friend after the house lights came up  dune was a great way to return to an actual movie theater  this is a great adaptation not a transliteration  the movie makers threw in some nods to the depths of the book almost like theyre winking at book fanatics such as me sayingwe could not fit everything in fill in the blanks in your head now kick back while we crank up the awesome hans zimmerman score and enjoy the mood of duneand the ornithopters
Aug 12 2022,positive,this new world works so well with the blue eyed people and their story with a beautiful plot and great actors
Aug 11 2022,positive,beautiful movie cant wait for the next never cared for the dune world before this
Aug 6 2022,positive,the visuals were incredible which is difficult to achieve in the cgi era we now live in for the most part the story stays true to the book which i always appreciate and most of the characters are similar to how i imagined them to be arrakis looks exactly as herbert described and the landscapes and wildlife are spot on it is a slow burner of a film to be sure and can at times be a touch too dramatic whilst i understood what was happening having recently read the book i could see how someone completely new to dune might be confused and a clearer idea of what was happening would have helped here overall though a good solid film and i look forward to seeing part two     a final note i would 100 recommend reading the book first its an amazing novel and will assist tremendously in understanding the film
Aug 5 2022,positive,absolutely great movie keep in mind the movie is 3 hours so if your not a fan of long movies this one probably isnt for you i personally love longer movies without getting into spoilers the movie is fantastic the story is compelling characters are interesting and the setting or universe is one that is definitely intriguing the various planets groups of people the technology it all comes together to create a unique spectacle keep in mind that this movie isnt your standard formulaic pewpew blamblam teeny bopper action film that crams everything into a 2 hour time limit its an epic that takes its time to build its world tell its story build its characters and set up for the next film definitely a must see
Aug 4 2022,positive,one of the best movies ever  i personally loved the movie not only cause of the enthralling visuals but also due to the incredible scores
Aug 4 2022,neutral,wasnt what i expected was all set up with no pay off pushing the plot for the sequel this is only the beginning
Aug 2 2022,positive,an amazing film for your home collection that you will watch over and over again and find something new every time gorgeous cast of actors graphics music everything is incredible though it ended very abruptly and quickly
Jul 30 2022,positive,its really rare to see an original movie with good actors stunts effects and story it really is when i watched the movie i kept asking myself why did they take them so long to come up with this movie its absolutely brilliant     its a fantastic movie watching it is an experience
Jul 28 2022,negative,most overrated film from the most overrated director forgettable bland plot boring characters and garbage dialogue masquerading as a masterpiece relies heavily on decent visuals zendaya and timothy charlotmane are awful actors i cant honestly believe why everyone thinks this film is a masterpiece it doesnt have a single piece of quotable dialogue and i cant remember anything remotely interesting from it
Jul 27 2022,positive,trying to put it to words  the perfect director for a story such as this he brings everything together visually and tonally  this is not for general audiences so i cant see why warner bros and legendary pictures would put up 165 million for it and this is only part one which makes this feel like half a film you can see this ones conclusion however most may not feel satisfied  there is also a disconnect with most of the characters as an audience youre ment to really push forward with these characters but for many of them we just dont care at all  visuals 65  acting 35  soundtrack 105
Jul 26 2022,positive,this is the best adaptation yet  i hope they keep going with it and i get to see many more books in the series portrayed
Jul 25 2022,neutral,im conflicted about this film i think denis is a brilliant filmmaker i mean arrival still stands as one of my favorite films ive seen but this film just didnt really do it for me starting with the positives its beautifully filmed every shot every set and every costume is visually spectacular the special effects are also spectacular the shields the bombs the worm were all amazingly well done with visual effects now to the negatives i felt like this movie dragged a lot i appreciate that denis is dedicated to a shownottell approach to film but this movie has so many mundane scenes that feel so senselessly prolonged fat guy floating through the air fat guy swimming in mud man watering trees old woman talking in a deep voice lady jessica having a nervous breakdown a lot of rich people standing around in cool clothes this movie was not as thrilling or as captivating as i thought it was going to be and i love timothee chalamet i think hes a great actor but i didnt really vibe with his angsty version of paul it felt a little too green dayfall out boy to me
Jul 24 2022,positive,not bad great visuals and the direction of the story was good a bit boring though i hate when they make a movie and it feels unfinished like they planned a trilogy and just gave us one part of a story instead of a complete story
Jul 24 2022,positive,ponderous serious looooong great cinematography
Jul 23 2022,positive,one of the best visual masterpieces of the 21st century
Jul 21 2022,positive,amazing start to a great series the picture was done with mastery all the colors and film angles were superb the plot has an amazing setup with an allstar cast really looking forward to the sequel
Jul 20 2022,positive,stunning cinematography unique special effects and a slow building intensity that is rare in contemporary films my main complaint is that it wasnt longer
Jul 19 2022,positive,its a given that the entire cast is great but plain and simple this flick bored me and to this day i prefer the 1984 version it seems many critics did not give the 1984 version a high rating but hey to each hisher own perhaps part 2 of dune 2023 will prove me wrong the storyline in the 1984 version flowed better whereas in this flick thus far in part 1 it just drags and if that is an indication of what part 2 will be like then what can i tell you yawn sorry
Jul 19 2022,negative,the new dune film is basically overrated pompous and grandiose but also slow and without any noticable change of rythm in periods its so tedious that one becomes aware of how the music goes extraordinarily hyped and accordingly disappointing
Jul 18 2022,negative,boring  best sound but bad story  i have to walkout for a snack and come back again for sleep
Jul 18 2022,positive,i love this movie it is fresh visually beautiful and mindblowing
Jul 17 2022,positive,amazing visuals loved the story 
Jul 17 2022,positive,im a little difficult to understand the storyline given it feels like a long time while watching this is boring
Jul 17 2022,positive,dennis villeneuve solidifies himself as the preeminent name in modern scifi with this film he has fulfilled not only his personal dream of making dune but also broken decades of hollywood hoodoo  the unsuccessful attempts to previously adapt the frank herbert property are worthy of a movie in themselves dune doesnt have the profundity of arrival still my vote for villeneuves best film in the genre but it is an excellent scifi epic and a specimen of visual magnificence
Jul 15 2022,positive,dune was a massive undertaking due to the sheer amount of lore and political backstory director villeneuve had to fit in a twoandahalfhour runtime but i am happy to say it was executed brilliantly    the story of dune is incredibly deep there are so many layers of political factions and relationships that it can get quite confusing at times i had to constantly be looking up specific individuals and their ties to each other to understand the minor nuances of the story despite that fact villeneuve is still able to deliver a coherent narrative that will allow the majority of the audience to understand the overarching plot after the buildup of the first act the story gets cooking and i was utterly invested    there is an incredible atmosphere present in this film it begins as a scifi epic following a house starting anew on a fresh planet and a new industry to conquer you can feel the optimism and the sense of discovery in the shots due to the interesting angles lighting and a brilliant soundtrack composed by hans zimmer but as the narrative evolves so does the tone as a thick fog of helplessness bleeds on to the screen and you can feel the dread form this tone was quite refreshing in todays blockbuster cinema as each movie needs to incorporate a vast amount of unnecessary comedy to appeal to the broader audience dune is unapologetic about what the story is trying to deliver and gives you exactly what it wants without any concessions    the visuals are stunning throughout the entire runtime one of my favorite scenes was during the spice extraction visit i loved the blend of realism that was used in this science fiction setting the ships and equipment look like they could exist in our own world with a few technological advancements the fight choreography is really well done especially the handtohand combat the final scene was epic each fist and punch were so sharp and calculated it was really impressive to watch in the age of jump cut action    the acting is perfect throughout the film i really cannot point to any one character that felt off or out of place timothee chalamet did an incredible job as the lead man he delivered a heartfelt performance and evolved throughout the entire film into the confident leader the story crescendos on rebecca ferguson oscar isaac and josh brolin all did great jobs as well i really brought the somewhat complex nature of lady jessic and duke leto they had really great chemistry with themselves and with their son stellan skarsgard had my favorite performance of the entire film i felt entirely disgusted every time he was on the screen and he made the hairs on the back of my neck stand tall he is truly a man poisoned by greed and will not stop at anything on his path to fortune jason momoa does a fantastic job here too i felt he really fit his role and his lines were delivered effortlessly much better than his performance in the dceu    dune delivers a fantastic scifi epic that gave me everything i was looking for and i will be eagerly awaiting the sequels release    score 88  verdict excellent
Jul 15 2022,negative,an incredibly mediocre poorlypaced movie that tries to distract you with a stellar cast but does not deliver on any front it is tedious characters are introduced at the very end and it has no actual conclusion i can see that its setting up a sequel but i believe that even a movie that is meant to be part of a trilogy should be selfcontained and not leave you wondering what was it all for rip oscar isaac you were the only interesting part of this movie
Jul 15 2022,positive,best action fantasy ive ever seen a kin to star wars i am not a personal fan of star wars and i absolutely loved it there has not been a movie like this yet my top 10 favorite movies ever
Jul 13 2022,positive,beautiful stayed true to the source material magestic and gorgeous with great world building
Jul 11 2022,negative,this cast was phenomenal i think if i had read the books id be very pleased with this movie sadly i did not read the books so this movie made zero fucking sense the cinematography was amazing and i loved the world that has been created  its really cool to look at but uh ill pass
Jul 11 2022,positive,absolutely recommended for people who love scifi movies   its one of the best movies ive ever seen fantastic cast and the soundtrack is just awesome 1010
Jul 8 2022,negative,this movie was awful if i could give less than 12  a star i would  it was long and boring  poor acting and mind numbing dialogue  i cant believe i watched it alli kept thinking something might happen      i cannot for the life of me believe there will be a second chapter
Jul 8 2022,positive,a perfect rendition of arguably the greatest novel ever written to its credit it bravely pays homage to many of the better aspects of the 1984 film
Jul 6 2022,positive,dune is a big story to tell and good to see they slow it down this time you know it will be a great series impeccable art direction and of course the hans zimmer magic enhances the whole production
Jul 5 2022,negative,while dune had some decent characters and an okay though really strange plot all the good characters died leaving only the characters i didnt like who werent very likeable it was an okay movie and i can see the appeal but it was too weird for me and didnt leave me wanting to see any more in the series
Jul 5 2022,positive,got to give it to chalamet he kills this role batem brolin ferguson and issac are very good skarsgård is just amazing in this role he is amazing as the iniquitous harkonnen leader and is a true reflection of herberts character  aside from skarsgård  the biggest winner in this film is the cinematography and visuals they are simply amazing and the big screen gives the greatest depth to how grand the visuals are   bautista and mamoa are fine and stay within the confines of their limitation but the quality dips a little with their scenes which is understandable   zendaya is very bland and has true limitation to what she can produce as an actor but she is not in part 1 enough to bring momentum to a grinding halt which is my worry for part 2 as herberts book looks to the fremen where we will probably see more of her which i hope does not stop the momentum built up in this incredibly good adaptation to a book which was deemed to be unadaptable to film
Jul 4 2022,positive,perfection some minor mistakes here and there but a definite cult classic
Jul 3 2022,positive,read the book years ago and enjoyed it as well as the second one children of dune  it was so richly textured in its creation of cultures along with mysticism and adventure  the first attempt at adaptation was nothing less than appalling  this film is a minor masterpiece because it holds the grandeur and esoteric flavour of story  the script is intelligent and captures the sense and depth of the story  the acting is top notch and kudos to the director and cinematographer  many elements seem familiar because writerdirectors from lucas and beyond have picked at the story and taken pieces for their own projects  this film deserves more than one viewing
Jun 29 2022,positive,beautiful cinematography bravo
Jun 29 2022,positive,a fantastic movie with great visuals especially on imax that immediately immerse you into a memorable experience with a fantastic cast and intriguing ideas that have you hooked to what the story is to bring a great builtup and amazing mix with its tone and ideology which definitely are worth watching
Jun 28 2022,positive,really good movie cant wait to see next chapters
Jun 28 2022,positive,not much happened big potential i look forward to the sequel or rather the end of this movie
Jun 28 2022,positive,awesome one of 2021s best films as a scifi fan this film is up there with wrath of khan empire strikes back and is a faithful adaptation of the book cant wait for part 2 dunepart2
Jun 27 2022,positive,yeah this is better than cats
Jun 26 2022,positive,dune is so rich and complex that for a lifetime i doubted a film could do the story justice yet the film that could not be made has been made nearperfection in its translation of the worlds described in the novel onto the screen a beginning is a very delicate time and this film patiently sets the stage for shocking revelations in the sequel treachery within treachery within treachery 
Jun 25 2022,positive,wow every single frame of this movie is a work of art the colors and contrasts the effects and dimensions and the sound wow the sound great performances from an amazing cast  loved the depth of each character epic story epic visuals epic performances
Jun 25 2022,positive,amazing scfi with stunning effects told much better than ghe original with an amazing cast of talent its pure scfi at its best
Jun 25 2022,positive,this is probably one of the best movies of this decade  more
Jun 25 2022,negative,it never ends and has about 20 interesting minutes in the whole film will not be bothering with the 2nd half
Jun 24 2022,positive,one of the best movies of 2021  when the movie ended i was wanting more
Jun 23 2022,positive,i adore this movie from the core of my heart it is magnificent frank herbert would have been proud
Jun 23 2022,negative,admittedly i watched this on a plane on my ipad but there was very little edge of the seat stuff here about 12 way through i realised that i didnt care what happened to any of them and i couldnt face another 75 minutes of not feeling entertained good effects but laborious direction and editing and overblown sense of self importance pretty rotten 
Jun 22 2022,positive,thoroughly enjoyed part one the story visuals casting atmosphere everything about it there are of course some changes from herberts source but i found it a well crafted modern adaption highly anticipating part two
Jun 22 2022,positive,its a pretty decent attempt but i feel like some of the main characteristics of the book were grossly overlooked    fremen were supposed to be a mystery but from the very start they were bad ass fighters who were attacking the harkkonens the absence of this startling discovery takes away a huge mystery and a large part of the political intrigue    liet and kynes were supposed to be two different people again an amazing mystery and discovery ruined from the get go the gender swap of kynes felt like pandering rather than a genuine effort to bring something to the story    chani was supposed to have red hair the whole point was that she did not look like the other fremen i believe again this was done to pander to certain groups that ironically will not be the ones buying tickets    it really felt like the rules of gurney and duncan shouldve been swapped by the actors gurney was the sloppy drunken warrior minstrel rescued from the imperial slave pits duncan was the stalwart soldier but because brolin is a much better actor it made sense for him to have the more involved role    jason momoa playing himself didnt really seem to fit here drax did a respectable job though he still cant act but he seems to be the top of the list of two of the most innovative directors of our day     surprisingly good paul was rounded out by a decent leto and an absolutely perfect amazing lady jessica i still dont know why everybody goes gaga over oscar issac he did an acceptable job but theres nothing great about the guy i really preferred both william hurts and jürgen prochnows interpretation     they did a very poor job indicating how pauls consciousness was being expanded by the spice its more like ive been a bene gesserit force ghost whispering into his ear rather than him being able to see the proper paths in his future     i like the cinematography however the  buildings vehicles and manmade environments seemed sparse and unfinished were talking about a feudal society that makes a great deal about ornamentation pomp and circumstance     there was not enough ambiguity in the atreides motives yeah theyre good guys relative to every other house but theyre still essentially royal aristocracy that uses and enslaves its subjects much of their supposedly honorable behavior is based on good public relations rather than morality and they address this in the books    in the end i would rather watch the 2000 mini series but its still an okay movie and much better than the 1984 one
Jun 21 2022,positive,enjoyed it  i guess keeping with the times now a days is a thing in movies   bit of woke pandering in here  not needed but not as bad as the woke disasters on display out there recently  absolutely hate that  scale wise though   this communicated the vastness and size of everything in dune very well
Jun 20 2022,positive,not always a fan of scifi but this is stellar cant wait for part 2
Jun 20 2022,positive,although it could have benefitted from an earlier ending this movie is nothing short of incredible a sifi hit that is sure to be a wellknown classic for the foreseeable future
Jun 20 2022,negative,for those watching dune for the first time youre probably thinking the plot is thin and youre right  ive read the book and watched the 80s film  the original film was an abbreviated version of the book which took a few liberties with the visuals yet it was an instant classic  this remake is not a classic  its not that it has a thin plot its that they spent more time on special effects than telling the story  here was the chance to remake a classic and they wound up with the equivalent of the remake of the shining ie flat  my suggestion  skip it and watch the original  it may be flawed and dated but it told the story way better
Jun 20 2022,positive,has everything you want except a endingyet
Jun 19 2022,positive,overall a good remake that respects the source material
Jun 19 2022,negative,a whole lot of mediocrity spread out over a lot of visually impressive but boring shots
Jun 19 2022,positive,it is the best since the first movie was made but does not have the same beauty logical style or flow as the first one i recommend seeing it but if you have seen the first you will understand what i mean
Jun 18 2022,positive,this film pulls you in from the beginning and doesnt spit you out
Jun 18 2022,positive,just couldnt take my eyes of timothee love the production and story cant wait for the next one
Jun 17 2022,positive,special effects 10sound effects 10acting 10story 20
Jun 17 2022,positive,movie of the year looking forward to the second part
Jun 17 2022,positive,it looks very good visually the plot and setting are wellimagined and complex although understandably the film is based on a novel of the same name it has in some ways reminded me of star wars the first dune film has more or less laid the foundation for the climax and peak events of the story that are likely to appear in the subsequent film however this has made it a little slow especially at the beginning and occasionally boring
Jun 16 2022,positive,a masterpiece  like my imagination was projected on screen
Jun 15 2022,positive,as close to the book as possible stunning visually but not as slow as bladerunner 2049 and herberts book material makes sure to feel the bigger world behind of whats shown hoping for the second part to deliver the same magic and not dive into improving the original
Jun 14 2022,negative,it made my eyes itchyfor hours  it took me two days to get through this josh brolin great  dave bautista very good and oscar isaac very hot and handsome on the feminine side chalumet and zendaya are very pretty but looked as bored as me pretty sure jason mamoa laughed a lot but tried not to
Jun 12 2022,positive,dune 2021 is amazing the scope is big the second half is thrilling the cast is awesome the first half is a little slow but otherwise an awesome film
Jun 11 2022,positive,visually stunning and it is only slightly infected by wokeism so its still watchable without biting your tung off
Jun 10 2022,positive,great special affects and excellent casting production must have been a challenge but they pulled it off well well casted with great cinematography
Jun 9 2022,positive,i wish more than five stars could be given this film is outstanding incomparable it is literally a blessing to the eyes and ears there is an attention to detail to the beauty of the shots to the cinematography the sound it is all made with the purpose of telling the viewer that they are witnessing something gigantic majestic important for what comes next i dont think it could have been done any better i have been waiting for the sequel since the minute i stepped outside the theater massive it is no surprise that it won five oscars including best sound
Jun 9 2022,positive,beautifully made and featuring a stellar cast this is another top film from director denis villeneuve
Jun 8 2022,positive,cant wait for the next movie
Jun 7 2022,positive,beautiful scenery very well done dialogues quite an improvement from the original film
Jun 6 2022,positive,simply does the book justice the cinematography is unbelievable as well as the acting the cgi was incredible along with the practical sets cant wait for part ii
Jun 5 2022,positive,i dont like movies that turn up the sound during the action scenes it is so annoying to have to keep changing the volume and yes we do have surround sound    still this was a very good movie very good build up and captivating acting timothee chalamet was especially outstanding i hadnt seen him in anything before and was very impressed
Jun 3 2022,negative,boring and midway unfinished what is the point it feels like it was more suited for a tv series it needs more character development to be more relevant and for us to care
Jun 3 2022,positive,this movie really surpassed my expectations and the boringness of the first movie i think splitting this into two films was the right choice my only problem with this movie would be the length between films they should have already filmed both parts instead of waiting to film part 2 of the same filmbook
Jun 3 2022,positive,wow i did not think this movie would be able to compete with the original but its holds its own i really enjoyed the movie and i am looking forward to the next movie
Jun 1 2022,positive,the best of 7th art a true film good story amazing photograf  this is art
May 31 2022,positive,as good a translation of the book as you can do in a 2 part film  visually stunning and well cast for the characters so familiar to they many fans of the book
May 30 2022,positive,as a cinematography nerd this movie will blow you away with its stunning scenes at times the movie assumes that you understand the political climate and history of the universe the performance of timothee chalamet and rebecca ferguson quickly brings you back with the utmost attention
May 30 2022,positive,boring but i appreciate the effort put in
May 30 2022,positive,loved this look forward to the second part
May 29 2022,positive,guess  i need to see it again missed the message other than im an epic film with cute actors
May 29 2022,positive,a visually pleasing film that relies solely on exposition and mystery to set up its plot perhaps a little overstuffed with characters and such but the worldbuilding is there and i personally am excited for the sequel to come out
May 29 2022,negative,snorejust as boring as the first onenow who exactly are the good guys iwent to the bathroom about 60 min in and when i came back there was a big battle going on that i had no idea of what it was aboutand by the way where are the sandworms barely seen and when they are theyre so big you cant make them outthought this would b good but not
May 29 2022,positive,i consider it necessary to start my review with the fact that i have not read the books have not watched the adaptation of lynch and do not know the whole story of dune and therefore only the plot was shown to me in the film and i cant fully judge her in fact the second part will decide everything without which there will be no point in the first so i really hope that there will be a sequel and i urge everyone to go to the cinema to see this film    but if you still go deep we can say that the picture has unconditional advantages in an atmosphere worthy of visuals with a relatively modest budget scope scale directing villeneuve proved himself a long time ago camera work a soundtrack from zimmer himself and an excellent cast    however there are also shortcomings although they are noticeably smaller  this is another story about the chosen one the predictability of the plot and some burdensomeness of the film and if typicality can be attributed to a halfcentury source then in the last hour the film is really hard to watch    after certain events in the film which i will not name in order not to spoil it seemed to me that the film would end there that 25 hours had already passed and i was about to get up from my chair but the film went on and on of course he did not pass in quality but perhaps the book should still be divided into a trilogy and not into two films    many people hastily call dune the new lord of the rings in scope and significance  with which i cannot agree nor is it the next star wars no its more like game of thrones in space and how this story will turn out to be a cult as i wrote at the beginning depends almost entirely on the second part which not only should be but should reveal all the questions while not losing in scope and here again it all comes down to hoping for a sequel will he put this franchise on a pedestal or will it like past attempts at its film adaptations sink into the sands of an endless dune 
May 29 2022,positive,as with all denis villeneuve films it is gorgeously shot and the set pieces are incredible  did he make this version of dune more interesting than the 80s version  i think he did a much better job of not boring me to death although the story is as dry as the sand its shot on  with a be movie essentially about spice wars i was secretly hoping for mel b and posh to sashay into the frame at least once   no such luck    i love denis villeneuves work but this could be my least favourite  great cast though
May 28 2022,positive,dune 2021 is a good adaptation that suffers from too many wellknown actors
May 28 2022,negative,id heard very good reviews for this film and thus had high expectations i was disappointed to be honest i found it rather boring the story moved slowly the 2 hr 35 min runtime was not necessary also i didnt find any of the characters to be particularly compelling which made it difficult for me to care about what happened to them despite the movie ending on a cliff hanger i dont really feel the need to watch part 2
May 27 2022,positive,yep im with the 80 i liked it
May 26 2022,positive,absolutely gorgeous and amazingly respectful adaptation
May 26 2022,neutral,maybe you just have to love the books to appreciate this movie never read them but was intrigued with opening plot cast and visual effects but it got confusing and then boring and ended up seeming like they were just pumping out desert scenes to live up to the title dune
May 24 2022,neutral,boring but artistic    dune introduces the audience to an interesting futuristic world that feels akin to scifi films from the late 1900s and early 2000s hans zimmer composes an ethereal soundtrack that elicits nostalgia of classic scifi and the visuals throughout the film create a beautiful and realisticlooking atmosphere though part of what breaks immersion is the blandness and emptiness of this entire world the story focuses on several factions that are offered up as advanced societies yet seem to be in the brink of extinction with how few of them there are    however where dune falls flat is both in its narrative and character development in two and a half hours the narrative barely progresses and it makes a large chunk of the film feel like unnecessary filler  that may change with its sequels but as a standalone film its a slog to go through because of the way the characters are acted they feel i assume intentionally so devoid of emotion which feels alienating as an audience member attempting to relate to and understand a characters motivations
May 24 2022,positive,i didnt know what to expect from this but i loved it the visuals acting and writing were on point i am excited for more
May 21 2022,negative,made it about 45 minutes before i turned it off  total snooze fest politics and the worse part was the constant whispering dialog that was near impossible to understand ok i get it you have to world build at the beginning but good griefkinda pointless if the actress is whisper mumbling the lines
May 21 2022,positive,to be honest this movie was not in my watchlist but after hearing so much about it i decided to watch it i loved the movie it was nicely made it was 2½ hour long but didnt feel dragged the cast performance direction bg sound almost everything was good now lets see what part 2 has to show us overall a good watch
May 21 2022,positive,it was my first contact with this dune universe and it made me curious to find out more   i liked the movie as a whole and the actors too
May 19 2022,positive,adapting an epic like dune is a monumental task but villanueva pulled it off i love all the main series books so i know what kind of scale is at play in the dune universe and man oh man did he nail it with style i cant think of a better adaptation of the book to the screen the visual style is amazing the characters look and feel like their book counterparts and the score is great theres ample zimmer bwaaaaaaahs to rumble your bowels i cannot wait to see the next installments my only complaint was that the sound effects drowned out the dialog in some scenes which is believable given the context but i believe could have been mixed better because after all this is a movie and the dialog should be heard suspension of disbelief nonwithstanding
May 19 2022,positive,a breath of fresh air in the era of cliche remakes
May 18 2022,positive,an extraordinary film that is captivating cinematography and soundscape is breathtaking every dimension of this film is hugely immersive i never watch films twice but i eagerly watched this twice  and would watch it again probably quite a few times more frankly
May 17 2022,positive,i was a fan of the original but the latest version was above and beyond lovely scenary great characters and absolutely awesome sardaukar
May 16 2022,neutral,wasnt anything special but curious till the end the ending wasnt anything special or inspiring
May 15 2022,positive,tremendous film dune is what a modern scifi should be this got robbed of best picture the soundtrack is a spiritual experience   cant wait for the sequel
May 14 2022,positive,it was pretty much like watching the original with improved fx  i failed to see the reason for making it  i feel that if you are going to reboot something it comes with a moral imperative to improve on the original or do not make a copy i watched this at the theater and found it to be overly long and when i had to get up and use the restroom when i returned it did not appear that i had missed much  i will probably go see part 2 if they make it as the time with the freemen is truly the best part of the book so i am hoping it is better  my wife watched it with me at home and endured it through the end and then asked me to never make her watch it again and to find something  else to watch to lift her spirit after this serious dose of darkness
May 14 2022,positive,a fantastic effort to portray dune the cinematography on display here is absolutely exceptional the sound design costume design its honestly a brilliant film in the technical sense as well as in the entertainment value dune is a bit of a niche film and it can be dense but i think this dune walked a fine line very well between being accessible as well as honouring the source material    i cant wait for pt 2
May 12 2022,negative,if you love b roll film of sprawling desert landscapes a big advertisement for zendayas new line of makeup and politics then this movie is for you for an adaptation from a book so heavy in political story it seems most of the story was left in the book
May 11 2022,negative,this movie was awful its everything wrong with main stream blockbusters and more   overly intense noises that serve absolutely no purpose everything is made out to be epic overly simplified were everything is told to you as the audience i do not mind long establishing shots to create feel and a sense of atmosphere but with villeneuve everything seems so overdone and meaningless not to mention it leaves out important themes of the book so it can leave in anything at least there are no meaningful ideas going on in this film it just seems like it wants to make a bunch of epic moments and the story along the way doesnt really seem to matter also a couple of these actors were terribly miscasts costume design was good i couldnt make it through this movie it was just terrible
May 11 2022,positive,loved it but it can get kind of boring dont think i would like to watch it more than once
May 9 2022,positive,ive read frank herberts dune books all up to capitol dune for countless times and im unbelievably surprised with movies accuracy illustrating that strange universe although some of details are left or altered this is an incredibly accurate representation of aforementioned books movie is thrilling even for those who never read herberts books only minus is that the second part is not yet in production
May 9 2022,positive,how coda is better than dune when you watch dune and coda you will be on my opinion for oscars oscars best movie coda anything else dune when you win all expect best movie you automatically think how when you win this awards you must win best movie but oscars think like a kid dune is perfect movie for every age you should watch it
May 9 2022,positive,in contrario of a lot of viewers i really did appreciate the lynch 84s opus music and atmosphere were key parts villeneuves dune is a modern vision of dune in respect of all we can nowadays do in a scifi movie and it works perfectly because it remains remarkably honest with the source material technicity do not kill the art part special effects are in service of the story and the story itself is well cut for the screen  not an easy task i only regret the  somewhat necessary adjustment i guess  role of dame jessica which is a little too soft and the abandon of the witch hunt of thuffir in this arc but man its good to see one of our sf pillar not wasted  rip foundation
May 9 2022,negative,loud audio  music and drawn out scenes the storyline is slow and boring i cant believe the rave reviews
May 8 2022,negative,too complicated to follow and also kind of dull at the same time
May 8 2022,positive,absolutely fantastic 
May 7 2022,positive,this movie is amazing great effects and story
May 7 2022,positive,i like slow movies dunes a slow burn its not very slow and the pacing isnt terrible most scenes consist of tense and drawn out conversations the slow pacing suits the nature of this movie it is just part one of the whole adaptation so it makes sense to give every scene some extra running time there are action scenes but they arent the usual pointless 20 minute ones they are meant to enhance the film for general audiences most of the film is about building the world and setting up the main conflict    at times the movie might get dull and too expository but it is usually covered up by its ambitious visual story telling it isnt really a huge problem in my opinion some people might say dune is boring i didnt find it to be boring the tension and conflict keeps rising which makes it very engaging    the fact that the book was inspired by the story of te lawrence makes me like it even more i liked finding some similarities while watching the film overall i think dune is a really good movie and is worth a watch
May 6 2022,positive,a beautiful stunning intelligent epic
May 5 2022,positive,the acting is great and  having not read the book  i think the story was good overall the only nitpick is that i didnt like where the movie endedit seems like they should have ended before the last scene or after the last scene however the movie is a great popcorn flick that is fun to watch if you just want to kick back and enjoy yourself give this a try
May 2 2022,positive,the issue is pretty much the same as with the book  too much mysticism foretelling whats next and a number of times at that doesnt help the film otherwise  superb
May 2 2022,positive,absolute masterpiece from start to finish bought it and already saw it more than 5 times would love to see an extended edition make it happen denis please
May 1 2022,positive,its good the world is very immersive and rich the fight scenes are the best aswell
May 1 2022,negative,that was the longest 2h and 30min of my life and the last sentence of the movie was this is only the beggining holy lord
Apr 30 2022,positive,this is an experience to watch everything about this movie stands out as mindblowing one of those films you need to see at least once in your life
Apr 29 2022,negative,i feel that this film is more overrated than big benz at the moment why the fuck do they have tubes in their noses this film is 89 overrated cinematographry and this film is clearly bending over backwards for an oscar and this does not please me i nearly fell asleep watching this and the dialogue was drier than a pensioners hole timothy was meh and you would have thought the star studded cast could have injected some life into this lifeless pile of spaceshit i didnt even understand half of it some space people get a hot planet with some spice but there is a snake overrated
Apr 28 2022,positive,sonic is a movie star theater theater with netflix theaters and king
Apr 28 2022,positive,warning i did read the books but i have not let that sway my opinion   this movie from a cinematography standpoint looks and feels amazing the establishing shots and score of the movie fit what this movie is setting up yes it is a setup movie for a series that i hope to be as long as the books if you enjoy films for their actionheavy and explosionfilled scenes do not watch this movie because unfortunately this movie will not be for you the movies character traits are realistic and can be understood the beautiful shots and wordless storytelling is something that deserve praise very happy to watch this movie and hope that it will kick off the series with overwhelming support
Apr 28 2022,positive,i almost fell asleep so many times but the 2nd half of the movie keeps me up ive been trying to watch it since december the cinematography is amazing
Apr 27 2022,positive,thought movie was good with interesting characters and great cast
Apr 26 2022,negative,not big fans on how very slow the movie pace is love the idea of the story though just not my thing i guess on how they reveal it
Apr 25 2022,positive,i think it is too derivative of the first dune movie rather than hewing closer to the book but that is hardly a strong knock against it so far it is wellacted nearly visuallyperfect and enjoyable despite ending in the middle of the story
Apr 24 2022,positive,visually this film is 5 starsits really well madefelt the story was a bit uneven at timesbut it deserves a sequel and cant wait for it
Apr 24 2022,negative,i guess you gotta be in the right mood to write a movie that is in the desert it was just so slow probably a good movie but i still have not finished it to this day even though im trying my best because of the academy i definitely put this movie on when i want to go to sleep
Apr 23 2022,negative,incredibly boring and contrived and about twice as long as it should have been a total waste of a great cast
Apr 22 2022,positive,this is quite possibly the best scifi film ever made i could watch this over and over i just wish the sequel was here now
Apr 22 2022,positive,after departing from middleearth and seeing the galaxy further distantly fading poetically while awaiting theatrical return to pandora there seems to be a need for another epic picture of singular multichapter continuation to conquer the screens with open attractive invitation to attend the next chapter and the next dune not only delivers that return to the cinematically peaked genre by scale but the grand tour de force gone beyond towards the history of past epics by learning from them honorably especially demonstrating how to avoid contemporary epics failures though theres still a convoluting vast that previously violently messed up somewhat surreally in the 1984 adaptation that stirred skepticism but masterful director denis villeneuve enabled decrypted understanding and nuanced engagement with amazing technically achieved visionary and brilliant cast supporting the story to its truest proper attentive form with riveting focus first view will be dedicated to encountering the story and be immersed as it progresses then the second view copes with further understanding and knowing the story fully leading into worthwhile anticipation of whats to come with rejuvenated interest a
Apr 22 2022,positive,the imagery and music were fantastic all around a great movie
Apr 19 2022,positive,when it comes to dune i definitely fall into the fanenthusiast category this is the star wars of my youth when i went to the original movie premiere on december 14 1984 i left the theater with a new found vigor i felt compelled to learn more and through the many novels i learned more than i ever thought was possible even as a child i love tragic characters and the world of dune is filled with them when the syfy channel released the multipart retelling of dune  on december 3 2000 i was all in unfortunately i didnt really like it it just seemed to shiny and clean which the books were not hollywood has a tendency to do that to stories so when this film was released i was expecting more shiny new stuff to my surprise i was wrong sooo wrong this film was the gritty dirty sand in your shoes adaptation i was not expecting a modern masterpiece and ive watched it more times than i can count which is not something that i normally do while i wanted to see the entire tale i think splitting the story up into more than one film was a great idea the books are literary works of art and great artists rarely produce just one piece i cant wait to see the next chapter of this film if you dont like this movie then youre not a fan of the books
Apr 19 2022,positive,i never saw the original and never read the books this movie is a masterpiece
Apr 18 2022,negative,snoozefest  i didnt understand the hype maybe if i had read the books it would have been bettermade more sense  but it boiled down to very limited dialogue which didnt explain the plot well and it dragged on and on and onwhich might be fine if the special effects had been absolutely spectacular but after seeing the cool helicopter and worm once that was enough  very long boring and sandy the acting was superbill give it that
Apr 17 2022,positive,really good adaptation of dune best version yet
Apr 17 2022,negative,a tedious epic that failed to tick all the boxes and some missed the mark so widely that it was almost pointlessly weak  the soundtrack is impressive but far too loud and intrusive  the dialogue is mumbled and made incoherent  the laying down of the plot is overly intricate and the entire film only serves to set up the next in the series  its just an attempt to produce a money making series  if you are a fan of the books avoid this film it will do nothing but disappoint
Apr 16 2022,positive,saw it with coworkers and geez was this amazing
Apr 15 2022,positive,great movie the quality is unbeliveable it was just art and i cant explain with words how amazing was that experience
Apr 15 2022,positive,the best movie i have seen in years
Apr 15 2022,positive,sadly i couldnt catch it in theaters but it still left a lasting impression beautiful
Apr 15 2022,positive,the director is master at stretching out very little happening to last over 2 hours    the lead character is supposed to be trained for leadership as the heir to a royalty and some higher purpose but acts like goofy teen wet dreaming about some girl hes never met but obviously will and whining that its all his parents fault because  well his grandpa was a bullfighter and maybe he wanted to be rodeo cowboy even though hes better suited to be the rodeo clown instead but he wasnt asked  and then the religious references bowing as in islamic fashion rocking back and forth near a wall as judaism then the desert natives of arakis of course resemble arabs you find on earth both in costume and custom eg wailing and even accent and facial appearance becausei dunno   boring
Apr 14 2022,negative,as a huge fan of frank herberts dune all of my online personas since the mid90s have been dune inspired names having read all the books seen all the movies and series i still cant let go of 1984s dune    i guess knowing all the background helps with where a lot of people get lost with the 1984 version and they lose the immersion that the music and acting provides  having seen dune so many times on reruns on tv during my youth and young adult years having owned it since i had my first vcr when i joined the military in the early 90s    dune 1984 is one of the few movies i can safely say i can watch and rewatch over and over  i just didnt get the same feeling with this new version  in fact it was so cringeworthy watching the forced horrible acting and rewrites from the writers the mispronounced names and places and the changes to the combat of the atreides i mean what the heck happened to the whole weirding module that was supposed to give the atreides their whole leg up combat wise which when employed by the millions of fremen was supposed to be the game changer for the universe    so much has been lost and there was no reason to make 2 movies out of the original booknone other than just another cash grab  i cant name one actor i liked in the new movie more than any actor in the original 1984 version  more audience favorites designed to gather rave reviews even though the movie itself sucked in comparison    if they wanted to make new movies go into the other books and tell the life of muadib after he has defeated the emperoror better yet go into some of the other races and planets and tell more of their storyrather than rehashing old ground that didnt need rehashing    cash grab horrible acting horrible screenplayhorrible combat sequencespathetic just pathetic reallyi wanted to go watch it again just to see if maybe i was just being jadedbut dangit was really bad
Apr 14 2022,positive,unsurprisingly denis does it again among the best cinematography writing editing and design i have ever had the pleasure to witness not to mention hans really is the best composer of all time perfect set up for whats to come and a feast for the eyes
Apr 13 2022,positive,the remake of dune is a visual treat and denis villneuve has captured an asthetic and style that suits the source material perfectly by basically rolling jodorovskis artistry and lynchs script into one modern looking beast but any fan who is familiar with the 1984 david lynch version will not be surprised by this movie or gain anything other than a visual upgrade  the movie is pretty much a shot for shot remake of that film in fact half of it the awkward ending leaves a lot to be desired and with no clear indication that the next part of the movie will then follow on to the rest of the dune saga its hard to justify this as anything other than a labour of love for villneuve  sonically its a bit harsh and unless you spend extra money to watch this in a cinema armed with a fully working dolby atmos sound field is going to be like watching it on tv    much like his blade runner sequel dune seems doomed to end before it really gets going which is a crying shame as his ability to tell a visual story puts him up with ridley scott and chris nolan but he needs to return to an original story for his next movie outing
Apr 13 2022,positive,best of the year looking forward to the next one
Apr 13 2022,positive,disclaimer i have never read the books nor have i watched the previous iteration this review is purely based on the 2021 film    dune is a cinematic masterpiece every scene is immersive and was carefully crafted into perfection its cinematography directing costume design and set design are out of this world but sound design and the score do stand out above all hans zimmer truly is a masterclass of music and every bit of sound seems to take you directly into dunes world  however i do need to point out that its plot feels incredibly slow maybe because the book was divided into two parts and while that is great from a storytelling point of view i was left wondering when something was actually going to happen  adapting a novel into the screens is never easy and dunes complex world is no exception some characters felt like they couldve benefited from more backstory for those of us who never read the books namely the baron  despite all of it thimothée chalamet and rebecca ferguson steal the show enhancing their colleagues also stellar performances as is expected of actors like oscar isaac jason momoa and javier bardem to name a few    i was drawn into frank herberts and denis villeneuves world and i am now left with no other option than to patiently wait for part two of pauls journey
Apr 12 2022,positive,really good cant wait to see the rest of it
Apr 12 2022,positive,just awesome cant wait for part 2
Apr 12 2022,positive,chalamet is perfectly cast here the soundtrack is soaring and the special effects carry real weight instead of cgicringe good stuff
Apr 11 2022,positive,the benchmark for set design and cinematography a casting and clearly directed with a goal in mind my only minor gripe would be that the film could have ended 20 minutes earlier and still set up for the sequel easily my favorite film of 2021
Apr 11 2022,negative,uh not sure what other people saw the story is dragged out i am sure to allow for 1 or sequels but the story is not that interesting yes the cinematography is amazing but the elongated plot just made is soooooo boring
Apr 10 2022,negative,the main guy is a boring skinny nerd who looks like an accountant  good to know nepotism is alive and well cause we all know he didnt get this role from sheer acting chops or screen presence  and most of the film was an eye rolling snoozer an anemic dull remake not recommended
Apr 10 2022,positive,awesome movie cant wait to see the next one 
Apr 10 2022,positive,imagery is cooli get kinda lost in the story though
Apr 10 2022,positive,this new world is so rich and awesome to know i cant wait for part 2
Apr 9 2022,negative,bad acting bad pacing dull storytelling  you should skip this movie yuk
Apr 9 2022,positive,its a cool movie but really slow i also hated the fact that this whole movie is just an introduction for the second part when it started getting interesting the movie stopped visuals and acting were very good tho
Apr 9 2022,positive,truly one of the best movies of all time
Apr 8 2022,negative,it was long and soso
Apr 8 2022,positive,overall i liked the film stunning imagery cinematography quality is through the roof i will say that the story was lacking in a way scattered fragments and the story moves so quickly its hard to know what is going on worth a watch 610
Apr 7 2022,positive,it alright edit ive had a change of haert dune is real
Apr 7 2022,neutral,the movie is boring and tiring it is a bridge that leads from nothing to nowhere i only felt instigated with the beginning the montage works in the minutes that oscar isaac is on screen otherwise i fought sleep
Apr 7 2022,positive,dune is the most beautiful movie i have seen in a while every frame is a painting the brilliant score complements the spellbinding visuals this is an experience the world is interesting the cinematography is amazing the politics are interesting this movies soundtrack is arguably hans zimmers best one yet  this is how to make a movie on dune frank herberts world is complex and rich the action setpieces are amazing the characters are interesting the cast fits the roles perfectly this movie is part one of two so this movie is great if the next one is
Apr 6 2022,positive,really enjoyed this movie  great visuals great cast cant wait for sequel
Apr 6 2022,positive,epic saga great achievement by director and art dept it took great courage hard work and fortitude to make this film such an admirable achievement however i was never effected emotionally none of the characters made me care what happened to them you do not feel sad or joy for anyone you simply watch you knowsuppose there are good guys and bad guys as we have all seen similar storylines and events in film but as in most scifi the people are secondary to the world and how its different on the outside  this is a mistake most often made in scifi as the audience never gets completely involved in the story and often finds itself thinking of other things like how much it must of cost to have created this or that or hire so many people for battle scenes or trying to figure if they are not real but computer generated etc etc i read the book too long ago to remember it and have seen other dune movies this was the best of them that i recall it was a very challenging effort to take on and it achieved a film worth watching i just wish it drew me in to the characters especially enough to care to see part 2 i saw this on a big theatre screen with dolby sound its the only way to see it there are times you cant hear or understand what some of the actors are saying but i found i didnt care and it didnt seem to matter worth seeing though most especially if you like scifi
Apr 5 2022,positive,the film looks great and some performances are good chalamet fergusson and the film is very ambitious in its scope yet the film often drags and the premise of the film is presented in a way that is dull technically brilliant but the audience feels disconnected at times but the film looks sounds and is presented in a wonderful way
Apr 5 2022,positive,one of the best executed scifi universes ever put on film 
Apr 3 2022,positive,dune is a good movie that could use a little bit of cutting down in order to become a great movie many things about dune fire on all cylinders including the vfx soundtrack and production design but the story isnt as gripping as one might hope that said its still an impressive well thoughtout movie that seems as if it should only ever be watched on a theater sized screen
Apr 3 2022,positive,riveting highoctane fantasy the likes of which we have not seen since the fellowship of the ring
Apr 3 2022,positive,im a dune fan and i loved it
Apr 3 2022,positive,its groundbreaking visual effects stunning cinematography impressive production values ambitious storytelling hauntingly epic score masterful filmmaking and a immensely talented ensemble cast make it immensely superior to david lynchs flawed adaptation although its complex narrative abrupt ending and slow pace may be difficult for some and its not as good as blade runner 2049 denis villeneuve expertly adapts its unfilmable source material and delivers an outstanding work in filmmaking like a scifi lord of the rings and that makes us very excited for the inevitable sequel
Apr 3 2022,negative,slow and extremely confusing movie
Apr 2 2022,positive,dune is an amazing movie packed with intense material that you always want to know what happens next i really wish that it had a bit more action near the beginning and i wish zendaya had a bit more of a bigger role she only got part in the final half hour of the film and in pauls dreams thats it other than that dune is a movie that i was very pleased by and is outstanding in cgi and storytelling
Apr 2 2022,negative,what a shit movie super slow pace and boring ending it felt like they taken a 15min long story and draged it out for 2h
Apr 2 2022,positive,being a massive fan of the books and being just ok with the old sting movie version i was set to be blown away with 2022 versioni was not disappointed from a book perspective they cram a lot into this movie but having see sawed between 45 and 5 my heart one out
Apr 2 2022,negative,honestly i was really disappointed i expected way more but was let down the cinematography was great but the plot was executed terribly
Apr 2 2022,positive,a atmosfera do filme é ótima intensa e imersiva denis villeneuve cria um novo universo visual espetacular onde transmite toda a mitologia de duna sua religião sua ecologia e ritualística duna é tão original quanto qualquer outra obra de ficçãocientífica que já houve nos últimos tempos temo toda misticidade e complexidade não terem sido abordados neste primeiro filme mas com certeza é digno e carrega uma grande história    the atmosphere of the movie is great intense and immersive denis villeneuve creates a spectacular new visual universe where he conveys the entire mythology of dune its religion its ecology and rituals dune is as original as any other sciencefiction work to date im afraid all the mystique and complexity wasnt addressed in this first film but it sure is worthy and carries a great story
Apr 1 2022,positive,this really was one of the best movies ive ever seen near perfect
Apr 1 2022,positive,best true scifi movie ive seen in years
Mar 31 2022,positive,i felt a lot satisfied with the scenery a thrilling and a smooth storyline a long duration time which i extremely pleased with overall its a perfect film for scifi and fantasy lovers
Mar 31 2022,positive,you can watch the older adaptations side by side and you wont think its the same story villeneuves version excels in every aspect of the art and sets a new standard for future space sagas
Mar 30 2022,neutral,i was looking forward to seeing this film but it was totally disappointing   why use color film when all o the sets clothes and outdoor secenes are so dark that everything looks black and white why have big name actors when their faces are unclear in the darkness and swathed in cloth timothee chalemet is the worst choice for paul ever madehe is a puny wearing with narrow shoulders and no physique to speak of greasy messy hair that continually gets in his face and made me want to take scissors to it plus the script and his acting makes him seem like a testy little boys throwing tantrums the only good acting was performed by oscar issac then there was no explanation of the various groups to help the people who didnt read the books know what the hell is happening  everything considered this film is not anything that makes me what to see the next one the uncut film directed by david lynch was a much better version of the story even if it ran nearly 4 hours and the studio cut it until it was a mess and failed at the box office the uncut film as lynch made it is far superior
Mar 30 2022,positive,the imagery and cinematography is truly something to behold however when it comes to storytelling i found there to be some speed bumps the number of names thrown at you is a bit overwhelming though i felt like i had a grasp of the basics by the halfway point in the film the narrative does plod along between the action set piece moments with my eyelids getting heavy from whispered dialogue and panning establishment shots its definitely not a bad film and im excited to see where everything goes but all in all this lengthy film felt more like the intro cinematic for a far larger story rather than a fullfledged outworlder experience
Mar 30 2022,positive,for you plebs dune is the ravenclaw to star wars gryffindor there its solemn and introspective but gorgeous and casts a long shadow notoriously stubborn to adapt to the screen the scifi novelseries staple is grand dark and can even be boring compared to the space westerns that make up such a formidable chunk of the genre if i had my pick of any director to undertake dune i probably wouldve picked villeneuve  although i wouldnt mind seeing a tim burtondesigned sandworm it felt like this was the natural undertaking after arrival and blade runner 2049 the movie is a visual marvel part of the charm of dune is that its futuristic it takes place in 10191afterall but is still rustic and rudimentary somehow an example comes in the form of combat while guns lasers etc do exist a type of shield technology has rendered most of them ineffective therefore the vast majority of the fighting occurs with good ol handtohand combat the juxtaposition of ships capable of interstellar travel and soldiers dressed in armor carrying swords real swords not lightsabers adds to the propertys uniqueness and if you like a handsome man in uniform this is the movie for you oscar isaac jason mamoa javier bardem dave bautista timothée chalamet all armorup in this one with intricate storylines sometimes you can get lost in the dialogue and keeping up with who is who  even with a 156minute run time there are a lot of characters to introduce and develop the only disappointment was not seeing baron harkonnen stellan skarsgård dangling from the contraption that carries his fat ass around like a spider the imagery of which as stuck with me in the book introducing salusa secundus home of the sardaukar was the most visually intense scene the sandworm devouring the gigantic spice collecting vehicle was quite the sight i dont see dune ever having the mass appeal of star wars which is totally fine its special and should be loved for what it is it looks like therell be a muchdeserved sequel make sure you see this one
Mar 30 2022,positive,overlooking minor pacing issues  this is one to watch as a scifi fan great acting great world building hopefully only the beginning
Mar 30 2022,neutral,beautiful bloated and boringand if like me youve never read the novel confusing enough that some kind of scorecard would come in handy too beneath the sandy surface of a faraway planet is a commodity so versatile so insanely valuable that everyone wants to get their hands on it thrust into the middle of it all is paul atreides a young man of royal lineage around whom the whole convoluted plot revolves apparently his actions will go a long way toward determining exactly who will end up with what as paul timothee chalamet is thin pretty and brooding with soulful eyes and an impressive shock of hair but sadly no spark at all the movies number one selling point is its spectacular look with its endless desert vistas much of it was shot in tunisia ancient spaceships and giant sandworms the movie almost but not quite won me over an oscar winner for its design editing and cinematography and deservedly so but a best picture nominee too not for this offworlder this was only part i  hmif i can just find the time to read the book before part ii comes along
Mar 30 2022,positive,absolute must see for anyone who has read the books or has in interest in scifi films  to clarify the movie is not an action movie so do not expect that going into it  dune does a very good job at adapting the book to a screen play and keeping the plot moving  it misses minor details but nothing too significant to the plot but it is also very hard to adapt a 700 page book entirely  special effects acting soundtrack and cinematography will blow viewers away and are on another level from other movies  timothee chalamet oscar issac and cast do a fantastic job at putting their hearts into their role and pull it off fantastically    only complaint about the movie would be at times the writing is not up to the other aspects of the movie and wastes the talent of the actors in it and can drag in parts but overall is an amazing scifi film and i cannot wait for part 2 in 2023
Mar 30 2022,negative,10 minutes in and i am already bored
Mar 29 2022,negative,before watching this i was unaware that it was adapted from a book or that it would be a series found it somewhat disorienting without sufficient backstory and with lots of importantseeming dialogue far too quiet to hear long run time with slow developing plot and the end of the film occurring just as the plot finally started to intensify despite there being great cinematography and an expectedly brilliant score from hans zimmer i do not feel particularly motivated to watch a sequel
Mar 29 2022,negative,i wanted to love it but found middling to dull
Mar 28 2022,positive,i loved this movie the costumes and cinematography were superb
Mar 28 2022,positive,visual masterpiece well executed screenplay simplifying dune universe for todays audience that 1 scene was an unnecessary uncomfortable unfortunate addition hopefully it has some significance on future story
Mar 28 2022,positive,an amazing direction script just perfect 
Mar 27 2022,positive,hummmmmmmmm who is the super cute main guy thingy because bro he is super fine like super fine i heard his name is like tymothè salamait or something idk idc but something more interesting than something something is so jason momoa so cute like hhuhuhuhuhuhuhuh yes please give me that seriously i kind of forgot the whole movie but whatever ok guys gotta go byyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee  sike still here sometimes im so so lonely guys movies that i didnt even watch and criticizing it makes me feel so good anyhow really gotta clean my bedroom well bye 
Mar 27 2022,positive,this movie defines cinema at its best its a very artistic take on the popular scifi genre and the world building is beyond compare i had somewhat of a hard time understanding of what was going on when the movie started but as it progressed the story came to me just to clarify i was going to read the books before i watched this but i didnt have the time to before this came out definitely going to read the books after watching this
Mar 27 2022,positive,great remake of the book
Mar 27 2022,positive,this is not a full dune but only part one and ended it where it did made little to no sense to where the harconans won  the original version was too long but this one is longer and does not even introduce the emperor and the reason for the decision and battle over the spice planet  action effects were very good but you cut up the plot to where part 1 made no sense
Mar 27 2022,negative,im a big fan of the dune books and ive seen both the 1984 and now the 2021 versions and i gotta say im not impressed with the 2021 version at all  while i felt the new versions ornithopter better matched herberts vision and the worms were cool the actors performance was sadly lacking  there was no emotion in their portrayal of their characters  no passion at all except for jason momoa  when leto  played by jürgen prochnow in the 84 film  cried out damn the spice and ordered the men to run you could feel his anger and concern for the men it gave me goosebumps  and would someone please tell the ones in charge of sound editingmixing that mood music is supposed to be in the background  not drowning out half of what the actors are saying
Mar 27 2022,positive,great movie a tad long but good
Mar 26 2022,positive,phenomenal  one of the best movies i have ever seen the artdesignatmosphere of the world costumes characters technology was unbelievable the soundmusic was incredibly cinematic and helped to build the suspense and action of every scene the plot was beautiful the acting mind boggling i envy those who have not seen this movie because they still get to experience it for a first time
Mar 26 2022,positive,its a well written story that combines mysticism scifi and large scale wars the storyline has just pushed itself to a crescendo hope they can deliver in part 2
Mar 26 2022,positive,was an awesome scifi movie it was like lord of the rings and star wars put in one there was not as much action like i expectedthe trailer made me think there would be quite a lot of action it was a bit slow but it was a very good movie
Mar 26 2022,positive,okay this movie was amazing and im so excited for the next
Mar 25 2022,positive,this movie is a masterclass in book to film adaptations it both honored all of the source material as well as innovated the story of dune for a 21st century audience and film i cant wait for part 2
Mar 25 2022,positive,a fifties story wrapped in 21st century cinematic genius  hardly original in any aspect the characters and ideas are a mashup derived from middle ages heraldry armor and swordsgalore with cold war alliances and factions fighting over the wealth of the desert called spice or what wed call oil throw in some religious mumbo jumbo references to priests oddly sounding like jesuits and a motherson theme that you cannot help but equate to youknowwho package it into a cinematic masterpiece butter the popcorn generously and try not to fall asleep  saul goodman
Mar 25 2022,positive,absolutely loved this movie the score was incredible had to come watch it in the theater to get the full effect cant wait to watch again and cant wait for the next movie
Mar 25 2022,negative,i had really high hopes but it was tough to get through it was so boring
Mar 25 2022,positive,a much better version of the book
Mar 24 2022,positive,better then star wars
Mar 24 2022,positive,the sheer scale of this movie was amazing literally the book brought to life i enjoyed it very much the cinematography and music really brought us into the world of arrakis
Mar 23 2022,negative,so incredibly boring and slow it wastes so much effort being caught up in its own vernacular that it completely distracts from a storytelling  cinematography is excellent cgi is well done but i will never get back 25 hours of my life from having watched this movie  i honestly cant understand how this movie has such a positive rating  it is now what i will put on tv every single night to fall asleep to    i wouldve expected much better from a edward scissor hands sequel
Mar 23 2022,negative,boring to look at and boring to listen to
Mar 23 2022,negative,how is possible that dune part 1 has such a high rating by both critics and general audience on rotten tomatoes is it willing selfdeception because the scifi novel on which the movie is based by which i was just blown away within 10 years of its first publication is iconic and the previous 1984 movie from david lynch was received so poorly this movie was barely watchable for lack of visual story exposition for those who have not read the book with very dreary versions of the bad guys including a far too brief view of the evil hoax originating emperor puzzling missing scenes like how baron harkonnen survived duke letos terminal attempted poison gassing way too many literally dark scenes excruciatingly slow pacing and so on not helped by changing the sex of only dr liet kynes  change more or none at all i was personally pissed off that early advertising failed to emphasise this was only part 1 of 2 proposed movies of herberts original novel  cant see how villeneuve will rescue his directed version of the story unless he radically changes style for lovers of the original novel go watch the year 2000 tv miniseries as its best visual feature version so far
Mar 21 2022,positive,this movie was definitely immersive the novel that inspired star wars now on the big screen it was an epic film amazing world building most have stated its as reminiscent of lord of the rings the premise is based on a very wealthy family protecting their most prized possession spice the wars between worlds over the commodity is intriguing as there seems to be a governing body on how this is all handled yet deception and war plays a vital role the acting was phenomenal writing is sensational looks like wb has another major ip on their hands i will say my only gripe is the mumble acting as i hate that but unfortunately there is no way to get rid of it since it infects all of hollywood overall solid film i give it an a
Mar 21 2022,positive,perhaps when i see part 2 this one will seem better  it wasnt as good as the original with sting imo  still such a great story and well acted
Mar 21 2022,positive,i had no idea what was going on and i still loved every second of it
Mar 20 2022,positive,one simply cannot claim to have read the book and give this movie just half a star or say it is the worst movie ever any one who has read the book knows that bringing it to the big screen is almost impossible especially when 75 of the dialog is actually made of the thoughts the characters have and the appendix explaining all the background history and the lexicon is 25 of the original book all the reviewers complaining about the lack of action they should read the section about pauls and jessicas escape and eventual meeting of stilgar and his cohort in the desert it is almost all about jessicas internal recriminations about her internal musings or fears about missionaria protectiva or about pauls visions about the coming jihad which hed have rather nothing to do with if he could the only action in this section worth at least 15 of the book is them escaping crossing the desert and pauls fateful duel with jamis      whoever has read the book would perhaps complain about the lack of insight into why the spice is so important about how this empire works about who are the bene gesserit why all the fuss with their superlative training or their missionaria protectiva or the ins and outs of the navigators guild or about how the harkonens managed to break the suk doctors imperial conditioning an absolute pre requisite in their plan for destroying house atreides      never mind all that the movie is a great attempt at bringing dune to big screen mostly faithful to the actual text could the screenplay be better in reflecting the character of the book perhaps but the book has many interconnected layers including a strong religious one which may not sit well with some audiences      perhaps the only complaint i would have would be the sound editing perhaps villneuve should avoid superimposing critical dialog with swelling musical scores or overwhelming sound effects hes done that to some degree in his bladerunner as well       im eagerly awaiting part 2 perhaps the sound editing will be better theres a lot of dialog coming in fact especially in the final chapter of the book it would be a pity not to be able to hear it as clearly as possible
Mar 20 2022,neutral,if you have not read the book its fine whatever  if you are a fan of the book go watch the first hour or so of lynchs movie for a better film realization of the source material
Mar 20 2022,positive,read all novels great rendering analog sound effects wonderful casting perfect worms impressive
Mar 20 2022,positive,i thought the movie was very well done great acting and cinematography interesting characters and fantastic special effects looking forward to the next installment in the series
Mar 20 2022,positive,an amazing vision finally does justice to the worlds and characters must see on the big screen you do not need to have any dune experience  book or previous adaptations  it is written for everyone and both the natural and constructed worlds are breathtaking
Mar 20 2022,positive,an absolute masterpiece in every respect for fans of the book the film brings to life very character so completely and fully its hard to ask for moreexcept part two   i was skeptical of chalamets casting but he is a great paul atreides more zendaya is expected in part two which should be great  beautifully filmed and directed the books technology and vision is indeed brought to life didnt want it to end but at least the sequel has been greenlighted
Mar 20 2022,positive,the entire film dune part 1 is epic dont walk run to see it im going again
Mar 20 2022,positive,its a thrilling experience even though it could have been so much better the visuals are stunning the music the sound are immersive the world creation is complex and at times bold but dramatically the film has way too many flaws it feels like one long exposition its not that it does not have any major events but villeneuve somehow makes them all appear smaller insignificant dramatically and chalamet simply does not have the depth to make this character work my five cents
Mar 20 2022,positive,truly epic  outstanding in all aspects
Mar 19 2022,positive,one of the best scifi remakes i can remember
Mar 19 2022,positive,i doubt this movie will win the oscar because its really just part one of a longer saga like lord of the rings fellowship of the ring i watched this originally on streaming first then saw it in imax which made the experience 100 times better sound design was great and am excited for part 2
Mar 19 2022,positive,i preferred chalamet in the indie films but glad he made it big go timmy
Mar 18 2022,positive,looked stunning and some great sequences but slowed down by repeated visions of zendayas admittidely beautiful face which did not progress the story
Mar 18 2022,positive,looking forward to seeing where they go with this franchise
Mar 18 2022,positive,this made me want to finally read the novelsat least the first one denis villeneuve continues to be one of the most visionary directors in the business
Mar 18 2022,positive,slay this was the third time i watched it this week
Mar 17 2022,positive,i read the dune novels and many of the sequels long before a movie was ever made i will say this newest version is very artistic visually arresting and almost poetic  however it lacks the passion energy and power of the 1984 version which makes that one still my favorite  for me the 1984 version no matter its faults and campiness better captures the heart and soul of the story      yes this newer version seems like a remake of the older movie in so many ways rebecca ferguson is a great actressshe was brilliant in the white queenbut neither she nor charlotte rampling truly convey the sorcery of the bene gesserit as well as the older film     the other actors do their parts well but no one really stands out or shines perhaps because they take their roles so seriously  additionally the action sequences in the 1984 version were much better directed and the overall story took a more dynamic process keeping the viewer held spellbound in ones seat unfortunately this new movie plods along a bit and there is nothing too new or exciting    i will definitely go to see part two as i am a dune fan but i do not think any additional sequels should be made  the story is very complex and convoluted and it is too difficult to truly capture on film  i appreciate the effort but this dune 2021 version will not be in my film collection as is the 1984 version
Mar 17 2022,negative,my partner looooves this movie but i dont there were several times that i practically dozed off it boasts impressive visuals acting and story the movie just puts too many information on a short runtime that i didnt have time to digest it contemplating of giving it another shot because of the rave reviews maybe its just me
Mar 17 2022,positive,if i hadnt read the book or seen the first made movie this movie would be fantastic  however since i have this movie isnt as good as it would have been since i already knows what happens before it happens which takes a lot away from the viewing experience  hence the 4 stars instead of 5  watching this was like watching the first movie just with updated visuals and deleted scenesso like a directors cut i guess  if you havent read the book or watched the previous made movie of this it will probably blow you away and really be worth watching
Mar 17 2022,positive,best movie in years cast storyline filming high marks all around we need more movies like this
Mar 16 2022,positive,i really liked this movie  i read the book a long time ago  from what i remember the movie was quite true to the book i also like the fact that denis villeneuve did not hollywood the movie to death  he let the story tell itself and didnt overdo it with over the top battle scenes
Mar 16 2022,negative,not a reader of the books but heres my review really wanted to like this movie with the stellar cast acting visual effects and an interesting concept those parts this movie does exceptionally well however pace was painfully slow a lot of confusing moving pieces and by the end of this long movie i wasnt really sure what was so groundbreaking about what was just watched
Mar 16 2022,positive,for a movie that was deemed impossible to make this version definitely grasped the essence and grandeur of dune hopefully there is a second movie
Mar 16 2022,negative,longer than needed boring sand flick good fx couldnt make up for a lame storyline only the 5 dune addicts you know will rave for this one saying its just horrible in every aspect is doing it a favor
Mar 16 2022,positive,did a reasonably good job of condensing the first part of the book  movie time limitations reduced the backstory on some of the different cultureshistory which was a minus for me  impressive visuals  while a good and enjoyable movie for me this is not the best picture of 2021
Mar 16 2022,positive,the best one s far nicely done cant wait for the second part 
Mar 16 2022,positive,frank herberts immense vision presented in his 1965 novel and elaborated in 25 sequels and prequels must have been a daunting challenge for director denis villeneuve and his team but the result is spectacular in all respects but one it is only part one i wish it had been made a sevenhour or longer epic like bondarchuks 1967 war and peace the bluray comes with fascinating features on how the film was made    a very promising beginning
Mar 16 2022,negative,stunning special effects with amazing acting cant help this long drawn out sandy drama soooooo boring
Mar 15 2022,positive,to sum up distant futures and other galaxies are still patriarchies and in need of the young white male to save the darker more savagelike people how cliche and tired if you are going to try and be revolutionary with your storytelling be revolutionary this story is old as sht
Mar 15 2022,positive,a very slow movie the visuals were very good but due to the lack of things happening it took a while to get through it honestly i was excited for the movie to end however i think this is a great movie for the next one and i expect something good i like the dreams with zendayas character and all the actors did a good job
Mar 15 2022,neutral,it was just average at best imo i dont see what everyone is so excited about it dragged on unnecessarily slow placing emphasis on a lot of nonsense imo if i want to be impressed with scenery i will watch a nat geo type show   the ships looked better as they should but personally i though the 1984 personal shield effect was far more interesting also they just had better actors in general   i am just glad i did not waste time going to a theater and spending money to see this boring rehash
Mar 15 2022,positive,thoroughly enjoyed it
Mar 15 2022,positive,i have had trouble getting into the book in the past and the beginning of the movie had the same struggle however this one pulled me in somewhere around the end of the first third its an absolute feast for the eyes i sort of wish i had seen it in the theater instead of at home theres honestly good acting all around though mssr chalamet has some periods where hes woodier than is ideal i would rate the score as very good with a lot of screaming    if the length puts you off just break it into three sessions it honestly could be three mini series episodes and it almost felt like that was the original intention each third feels contained with an arc that does some tidying up by the end save for a cliffhanger i look forward to more
Mar 14 2022,negative,not having ever seen the original dune nor read the book i was totally lost  im not a fan of the dark cinematography which only makes it harder to follow  had to turn on closed captioning because we couldnt understand half of the dialog  im sure the dune junkies loved it but for anyone else a waste of time  i could have watched 2 better movies in the same amount of time  stuck it out thru the end only because im stubborn and refused to believe it wasnt going to get better
Mar 14 2022,positive,its long but worth the time investment  visually awesome sometimes the story is hard to follow and the extreme high  low volumes gave my thumb a workout remote control  overall very good and will watch part 2 in 102023
Mar 14 2022,positive,interesting and breathtaking film hopeful for part 2
Mar 13 2022,positive,what a great start cannot wait to see the next part
Mar 13 2022,positive,so interesting and beautiful good actors and actress and director was great
Mar 13 2022,positive,fantastic movie maybe my favorite of the entire year visually one of the most beautiful movies ive ever seen great soundtrack great cast although its not perfect i still give it 55 because i saw the nwh critics and i think this movie is way better would have been a 45 otherwise
Mar 12 2022,positive,i think this dune edition is satisfactory especially compared with a 1984dated movie for a dune reader the 1984 version moved so fast without describing the situation it loaded so many scenes and fragments without making the audience digest those the 2021dated version doesnt only satisfy in a way with visuals and the method of telling and describing the story unlike the old one    the most exciting scene was witnessing pauls awareness sessions this is unique and each booktomovie case should take this example while using flashbacks and flashforwards also the producer transferred the right amount of lod level of details from the book by using some genius tricks such as choosing holoprojectors to illuminate the backstory and some details instead of adding more 11 dialogue some of the information gathered by 11 talk in the book is summarized by holoprojectors     the movie is also good at concealing particular moments from the book in the book the moment of forbidding excessive water usage was a critical point amid the movie i wished to see this example but showing this example in the context would be so didactic it would be an example that diverges from the movies approach    but i am concerned about those who didnt read the dune series this movie will make so many open points maybe by using this momentum you can read the series my reading was inspired by the 1984dated movie
Mar 12 2022,positive,i love acting movies
Mar 12 2022,positive,cant wait for the next chapter
Mar 12 2022,negative,this is a movie for people who have read the book otherwise its a incomprehensible mess
Mar 12 2022,positive,it might be confusing for someone who has never read the book due to its scope  and it requires a certain level of intelligence to graspthose dimwits will scoff at it while pretending to be credible  given all that and the fact that it might be the best scifi story ever written id rate this version as 45 stars compared to the previous versions both at 05 stars  praise for the director for pulling it off  my big disappointment is not being able to see all of the movies at once  now i have to wait months for the next movie and months more for the next  i expect it will take three in total  i wish i could thank him personally for doing justice to the story  my only dislike was changing the fight scene location  it was unnecessary and only used to wrap up the ending which would have been better following the book imo
Mar 12 2022,positive,far better than the original story in regards to investment and quality denis is a master world builder 
Mar 12 2022,negative,too futuristic for my taste
Mar 12 2022,negative,dune 2021 was probably the worst sci fi movie i ever saw  the acting was good but the plot was confusing complex and stupid  there was far too much violence displayed in excruciating detail accompanied by deafening noise  i read the first three books in the series and the first is the best  they get worse as they go along  but this production just clomped a bunch of slop together  this is definitely not worth seeing
Mar 11 2022,negative,too long complicated to understand storyline but good investment in sets actors and equipment
Mar 10 2022,positive,you dont get to watch a lot of movies like this a week later and my heart is still pounding from the intensity of this film feels very mature for a pg13 movie and i couldnt be more impressed my only complaint is i have to wait til next year to watch part two
Mar 10 2022,positive,the best version of dune  i look forward to the sequel
Mar 9 2022,positive,a technically perfect film it starts off calmly and subtly but when the pace of the film picks up and unfortunately ends
Mar 8 2022,positive,i loved dune i totally felt immersed like i was there with them the story is interesting its a mix of medieval and fantasy with a touch of video game def enjoyed it
Mar 8 2022,positive,an awesome movie with great atmosphere an absolute must see
Mar 8 2022,positive,hans zimmer and denis villeneuva team up yet again to deliver us another cinematic masterpiece if its a denis villanueva movie watch it if its got a hans zimmer score watch it if you put these guys together they deliver quality films worth all of our times bladerunner 2049 left an imprint on my brain but dune gave a beat to my heart cant wait to see what they bring us in the sequel
Mar 8 2022,positive,this is great one to watch in dolby cinema or imax well worth for spending few extra bucks to watch in high quality
Mar 7 2022,positive,good movie overall best thing is the visuals only complaints is that it can sometimes be a little slow also has a weird ending
Mar 7 2022,positive,watched a special screening just before part 2s release and its so good the way the made everything acceptable even if this is scifi is really astonishing
Mar 7 2022,positive,best movie of 2021 in the cinemas cant wait for the next part
Mar 6 2022,negative,the only good thing about this movie is that i now know to ignore the reviews of any critic who liked it
Mar 6 2022,positive,this is epic filmmaking at its finest  of course there are some nitpicky plot andor character actions which i questioned as not valid i never read the novels but condensing the storytelling from the novels into an engrossing beautiful cinematic experience is a true master feat
Mar 5 2022,positive,denis villeneuve had already proven himself to be a great world builder in his films but in this one he excels superb
Mar 5 2022,positive,the cinema trophy was beautiful and the story was interesting  cant wait for the sequel
Mar 5 2022,positive,just a straight up masterpiece of a rendition of one of the greatest scifi stories
Mar 5 2022,positive,theres something missing new ideas
Mar 5 2022,positive,cinematically it was pretty much what you would expect for such a wellproduuced effort  as far as the storytelling goes it was just okay  it doesnt really meet the standards of the book upon which it is based  entertaining enough and i will watch the followons
Mar 5 2022,negative,extremely slow 100 mil art film costumes a cinematography a production design a acting c screenplay f direction d visual effects a sort of like watching paint dry a really expensive paint somebody remind those amateurs the 1 rule of filmmaking show dont tell exposition handled like a student film bye 
Mar 5 2022,negative,the film would make sense if it lasted for 40 minutes because thats all the material it has everything else is really pointless imagery and chamanic empty words  there is supposed to be a half worm half human character who happens to be the evil antagonist well apparently the budget could not allow for such a sfx stunt of make up an cg since you cannot ever see his body  also air ships are solid straight metal winged mosquitoes straight metal wings as the impulsor  all the scenario is plane desert such a blessing to discover dunes  the film is continually dragged off by visions of the main character about its prophecy which real impact in the unexplained universe is unknown  also you get to see the giant worms once and it is disappointing made me feel like a chick having really bad luck with her male hook up of the night it was so bad i went off my way to complain in the internetit looks like soft ugly genitalia and as soon as it came it left  in my opinion this is the longest cologne advertisement of the history and thats all  avoid unless you wanna see the actors you wanna see because thats all the movie got to offer famous actors   also this is the last time i trust this community opinion on a film what a waste of time
Mar 5 2022,positive,great effects slow story but you can tell an epic story awaiting the next
Mar 4 2022,positive,phenomenal film villeneuve always delivers this will without question become the adaptation of the classic book for generations to come the second act was a tad bit slow for my taste but did not really affect my view on the film as a whole
Mar 4 2022,positive,this movie was a great adaptation of the book and definitely had the best visual and audio effects in 2021 while the start of the film is slow it is for good reason as it does an amazing job at world building and sets us up for a great second leg timothee chalamet fits the role perfectly and all the cast makes you feel as though the world you are watching is real the visuals in the movie are definitely a standout as well as the soundtrack would definitely recommend
Mar 4 2022,negative,every scene was a work of art but that was about it the story was slow and confusing and each line got you more and more lost into the plot without reading or watching previous works on dune you would simply hate it is it worth the watch maybe but overall it was just cinema candy not a story line you could understand or love
Mar 4 2022,positive,the movie was kinda boring for me and i watched it on a big screen this one is better than the awful 1984 version but it feels like a big introduction and incomplete not a standalone movie the actors performances were kinda weak imo the only highlight was stellan skarsgard as baron harkonnen the film is disjointed and confusing the only reason i understood was because i read the books great visuals though
Mar 4 2022,positive,im so excited for part 2 this is scifi ive been itching for
Mar 4 2022,positive,very well made movie liked reading the book and i thought the movie really did it justice oscar isac was good they incorporated a lot of good stuff from the book movie could have been ended a bit earlier and saved a couple things for part 2 but still so much to like that that can be somewhat overlooked
Mar 4 2022,negative,well that was two and a half hours of my life that i will never get back
Mar 3 2022,positive,felt incomplete will enjoy more once other movies come out still an incredible watch 
Mar 3 2022,positive,a parade of lavish set pieces interrupted only by long lingering close ups of chalmet pouting about     although the film does not ruin the story of dune it does leave out information that would have been useful to the audience in exchange for lots of screen time featuring indulgent brooding shots of timmers often reacting too well anything shot of a grapefruit better follow it up with a non talking reaction shot of paul atredis looking mildly baffled and forlorn about its existence is vitamins c really good for you he muses internally     idk the director is a great visualist and has good taste in casting as most of the actors are excellent but is it the best dune adaptation that it could be not sure on that one maybe if the editor obsessed more on story and less on non story enriching cutaways of the chal
Mar 3 2022,positive,after watching this film ive come to the conclusion that the only way to experience this film is on the biggest screen possible this is visually one of the best of its kind director denis villeneuve has crafted an operatic space epic that feels comparable to that of the lord of the rings trilogy despite its minor flaws in terms of the development of some characters especially the villain and the fact that this is one part of two the film succeeds in every other direction the main characters and their performances are brilliant and leave much to anticipate for the future the world building and the craftsmanship that went into every scene is beyond breathtaking and is complimented by the beautiful score that accompanies it although there was much that felt left out in terms of giving seemingly important characters something to do the film is a much watch and deserves the attention of the viewer
Mar 3 2022,positive,great plot performances and wonderful visuals i cant wait for the sequel
Mar 3 2022,positive,its a very fun very good acting a little confusing at the time and definitely recommend if you like star wars and star trek it one of those things
Mar 2 2022,positive,good but maybe too long
Mar 2 2022,positive,welcome to a new obsession perfect soundtrack and cinematography stunning performances by the actors and rich slow burn worldbuilding that is in fresh contrast to the usual instantgratification of action movies a true passion project impeccably executed
Mar 2 2022,positive,adapting frank herberts epic mythologyfilled novel to the big screen is a task which has gotten the better of many a filmmaker but denis villeneuve has thankfully pulled it off im a huge fan of villeneuves work a man who takes time to allow stories to develop and characters to grow and this film once again demonstrates his incredible ambition and dedication to his craft the film clocks in at around 2 hours and 35 minutes an unwieldy runtime by any standards but villeneuve uses the time well mostly slow dripping the backstory and mythology so it doesnt become too confusing its still hard to keep up with at times and i was reminded of watching the first episode of game of thrones where names of characters districts towns and other things are thrown at you full force and you have to sit back and try and process it all i understood most of what was going on and which characters wanted what though some of them got a little mixed up in my mind the film looks enormous shots of cities deserts and groups of people are made to look gigantic thanks to the camerawork and the sheer scope of everything hans zimmers score while a little overenthusiastic at times is also suitably epic i liked the performances from the unbelievable cast though with so much going on some of the bigname stars such as the highly billed javier barden and zendaya get very little to do but their role in the sequel is certainly established the action scenes are beautifully shot and choreographed and you always have a sense of where things are and where people are going except for the final fight scene which apes the worst of marvels hand to hand fights for some unfathomable reason its a giant undertaking a giant story and its resulted in a naturally giant film it works well on its own and sets up the next one perfectly for the first time in a good while a sequel has been teased and im actually looking forward to it
Mar 1 2022,neutral,could this stand alone as a good movie with out the lead in to a sequel no it was ambitious to fit the source material into a single movie and imho a fail aside from jason momoa there was no humanity portrayed by the cast every other character was so drab uninteresting and unrelatable
Mar 1 2022,positive,a fantastic scifi movie and an instant classic it is slow at first but is building for an even more epic sequel
Feb 28 2022,positive,an ambitious and visually stunning epic combined with villeneuves direction the script he cowrote with roth and spaihts the performances of the cast zimmers score frasers cinematography walkers editing vermettes production design roberts and siposs set decoration morgan and wests costume design action sequences sound design and visual effects dune is a visually epic that lives up to its source material
Feb 28 2022,negative,this is a movie that looks great and should be great but certain performances and deviations from the book keep it from being what it should have been 
Feb 28 2022,negative,way too much sand big worm scary
Feb 28 2022,positive,great visual effects and well produced looking forward to part 2
Feb 28 2022,negative,style over substance superb cinematography  visuals as with other villeneuve films so why only 1 star    hollow the paper thin story stretched over 2 12 hours made it feel empty    soulless zero emotional connection to anything happening on screen    pretentious selfserious to the point of parody      repetitive how many times must we endure zendaya walking in slow motion    aloof no relatable characters everyone is stiff and stilted    terrible score couldnt believe it was hans zimmer     the fact that some early reviews compared it to lotr and original star wars trilogy is insane definitely a let down
Feb 28 2022,positive,parts of this movie sent chills down my spine specifically the sound design the uncanny valley effect of the chanting priests chants made the film feel beautifully offkilter maybe the best use of computerrendered effects to date in any medium
Feb 28 2022,positive,closest adaptation of the book  into a movie
Feb 28 2022,positive,mark my words this is the next star wars
Feb 27 2022,positive,any scifi fan needs to watch this outstanding
Feb 27 2022,negative,awful two and a half hours of nothing 
Feb 27 2022,positive,best scifi movie ever im a huge star wars fan and id have to confess i love this better than star wars
Feb 26 2022,positive,epic film one of the best in the genre
Feb 25 2022,positive,best movies ive seen in a long time the music the cinematography and the acting were perfect
Feb 25 2022,positive,its familiar but stands alone pretty well and it is undoubtedly best seen on the biggest screen possible  despite being dazzled visually the film didnt fulfill me  i couldnt not have cared less about any of the characters  timothée chalamet is a perfect choice to play his character but the lack of character development overall was a giant disappointment  theres not much humor and its hard to imagine humans looking exactly the same so many hundreds of years later but i digress  its fine and will be worth watching the follow up  final score 810
Feb 24 2022,negative,couldnt wait to see this remake but what a disappointment  i have seen the first dunes several times and read the first 2 of herberts books  this movie requires a sequel but the first dune movie was complete  dune first was better in color special effects cinematography clear storytelling acting character development  and the list goes on and on  the acting was equivalent for what there was of it this was a waste of my time and i will not be seeing the dune 2 in development as of this review  if you loved the first dune you will be utterly disappointed in this one
Feb 23 2022,negative,didnt read the books and never saw the original i was not really able follow the story on a first viewing but the graphicsmusiccinematography were excellent
Feb 23 2022,positive,closely related to the book an excellent display of sciencefiction spaceships and shields the action keeps rolling throughout the movie i thoroughly enjoyed it
Feb 23 2022,positive,a perfect start of the dune story well see how it goes in the next chapter
Feb 23 2022,positive,absolutely stunning movie with gorgeous vfx this work of art not only blew my socks off but made its audience really feel immersed denis villeneuve really showed his passion for film making on this one 55 stars
Feb 22 2022,positive,the cinematography and the score was great the pacing of the movie was just right allowing you to be completely  involved of the film
Feb 22 2022,positive,stunningly well done if you like alternative worlds and complex storytelling the directing acting and cinematography are top notch in all regards wonderful set up for future movies as well highly recommended
Feb 22 2022,positive,i wish the worm has more characteristic features
Feb 21 2022,positive,from the music to the cinematography this movie can easily be considered the best movie of the decade
Feb 21 2022,negative,found it to be boring and not much action
Feb 21 2022,positive,fans of the book and its sequels thats me will appreciate the thematic and visual intensity of dune others may balk at its meditative pace and unshowy effects its not a scifi extravaganza its more reminiscent of 2016s arrival although not quite as psychologically mindbending as that film all in all though i anxiously await the sequels
Feb 21 2022,positive,i was engaged from beggining to end big applause for this film
Feb 21 2022,positive,good movie but i despise cliffhanger endings that make us wait 2years before its conclusion i would rather just forget i ever saw it
Feb 21 2022,negative,the movie fails to show us why we should care about these characters this world or this space empires politics some interesting moments dont make up for the lack of heart and soul in this movie the score was distractingly bad
Feb 20 2022,positive,amazing work from hans zimmer it makes the film even more powerful
Feb 20 2022,positive,its a resital for ears a feast for eyes it is like lying on hot sands in beach with a glass of beer
Feb 20 2022,positive,visually and aesthetically triumphant the film hooks you early with interesting bouts of diplomacy and politics where is fails however is in the action department which is where most of the second half of the film is focused a pg13 mess of bloodless cgi malarkey
Feb 20 2022,negative,i think while you want 2995 to rent it i wont be watching it
Feb 20 2022,positive,dune is a visually appealing movie with a great plot slow pacing at times but mostly paced well dune does not let down with the amazing cgi but relies on it too much throughout the film another drawback is the marking they used for the film promoting zendaya the most when she has a minimum of 5 minutes of screen time overall dune is a great movie and im excited for the future of the series
Feb 20 2022,positive,movie is fantastic the venue not so much
Feb 20 2022,positive,i went to see this in the cinemas a while ago if you too are wanting to see this in cinemas pay very close attention i wasnt 100 engaged from the start so i got very lost in the storyline when watching it again i have a much better understanding of what happened and it was honestly a great film greig fraser did a outstanding job with the cinematography in this film the reason this gets 4 stars is because of hans zimmer this soundtrack was a m a z i n g while watching it the first time  being very confused of what was happening  the only reason i didnt get up and leave was because of how perfectly hans zimmers work fit so well with the film words cannot express how good this soundtrack was especially paired with denis villeneuves directing chefs kiss
Feb 19 2022,positive,incredibly true to the novels and the cinematography is just out of this world both of these things together made this movie my best watch of 2021 and made me reread the first four books
Feb 19 2022,negative,too much special effects and not enough story  i didnt realize this was only part 1 even though it was 2 12 hours long  i prefer to watch the 1984 movie version of this book  i recommend waiting until you can see this for free on cable tv or stream and wait until you can see both part 1 and 2  i wonder when part 2 will be coming out
Feb 19 2022,positive,my knowledge of dune has only ever been the 1984 film which i liked a lot one of my favourite scifi movies and the tv series which was not as engaging never read the books so i cannot compare it to the source  my point of reference will always be 1984 this is a very good reboot of the 1984 film possibly better than the original 1984 version but the problem for me is it is such a carbon copy almost line for line and i am so familiar with the plot that it struggles to keep me interested i almost wish i had never seen the original then i would probably like it a lot it is certainly a visually impressive and well produced film which appears to be very faithful to the story the producers come across to me as great fans of the original source material with an almost fanatical attention to detail
Feb 19 2022,positive,the movie was 97510 the reason why take the 25 off is really cause i just thought some parts were cringe which is why i only the quarter but overall the movie as well written and for i am told kinda with the book which is always appreciated i need to go read the book
Feb 19 2022,positive,despite trying to wrap itself in an aura of mystery  the story is highly predictable very slowmoving and downright boring  there must be at least 20 minutes of scenes of people walking in a choreographed fashion  everyone speaks in a pretentious stilted fashion  the scenery and spaceships however are exceptional       ps all the good guys are goodlooking and all the evil people are ugly  can you get any deeper than that
Feb 19 2022,negative,this movie is unfinished ending when the actual story is about to start all it does is explain the worldbuilding and hype up the mary sue protagonist drag on about 26 hours when its painfully boring and dry this movie should not be called dune it should call dune chapter 1 please come back later
Feb 18 2022,positive,looks great but very very slow pace not a lot happens in a 25 hour movie even though it does look great i feel like there isnt much substance to the characters theyre very one dimensional it seems to be both heavy on exposition and yet i didnt understand why things were happening    if you havent read the books i wouldnt bother looks nice but essentially quite boring
Feb 18 2022,positive,superb experience book to movie done well and faithfully i feel sorry for those who dont know the background and what this original series inspired looking forward to second instalment a masterpiece
Feb 18 2022,positive,great performances especially from lady jessica loved the visuals of the spaceships and the shots of the armies very awe inspiring from the scale of everything
Feb 18 2022,negative,not sure where any of the high marks are coming from this plodding slooooow wimpy lead who has special powers yet somehow gets the girl in the end and we all know will lead armies against the bad guys in the dune ii movie because  you guessed it this one didnt wrap it  didnt deliver either  not worthy of a 2nd watch  when is hollywood going to learn  if the characters werent uninteresting enough to hold your attention past minute one the writing didnt go anywhere either  sooo couldnt care less worthy  too many high marks for rt  no repeat biz from this guy
Feb 18 2022,negative,i had no idea what was going on nor did i care  everything from the two note score that vacillates between major minor major minor to the computer generated special effects drab costumes and some of the worst acting of any film this epic disaster should be called   dunesday  horrible is too kind of a word for this scifi over bloated over rated crap
Feb 17 2022,positive,this is a science fiction book series i loved reading in my 20s  this movie version was a very good attempt to capture it on film  i liked the treatment of the bene gesserit  i hope in the next sequel they explain them with greater depth   the actors and directors and special effects were true to the original story
Feb 17 2022,positive,starts with slow and familiar plot  but sneaks up surprises and enraptures you the familiar falls away with visually stunning imagery the slow start is interrupted with several short but haunting scenes i didnt realize i was 15 hours in when the boil erupted then i was glued to the screen hard to believe  but when you hit the 2hr and 30m pointyoure left wanting more
Feb 17 2022,positive,an absolute sight to behold plot was great and executed beautifully by the whole cast would watch again on a bigger screen than the last time i watched it
Feb 17 2022,neutral,this film just didnt click for me the storyline was incredibly slow and at sometimes very vague or confusing they showed that close up of zendeas eyes far too much although admittedly there were good moments and the acting was on key
Feb 16 2022,negative,dennis villenueve adapting the biggest scifi novel no please thanks 310
Feb 16 2022,positive,great plot acting and wonderful visuals
Feb 15 2022,positive,i really liked this re make version of the movie i liked the selection of cast used as well as the diversity of the cast im normally not a big fan of re makes but since i loved the original dune i had to go see this movie and i wasnt disappointed im definitely not a professional movie critic  but im pretty simple and i like what i like i cant wait for the next movie can we get a dune netflix series
Feb 15 2022,positive,long need to rewatch bc i fell asleep it was so long lol z was in it for like 5 mins beautifully shot kinda felt like it was still based on an old book though
Feb 15 2022,positive,the best version of dune more faitful to the book than others
Feb 14 2022,neutral,a sleeper  no plot and way too long
Feb 14 2022,positive,it isnt often that a movie follows the original novel and doesnt embellish the plot at some point dune is completely true to frank herberts three novels the cast is excellent i look forward to the next chapter as the first only covers about 50 of the first novel
Feb 14 2022,positive,im really tired of the cashgrabs these companies pull by dividing a story into two or three movies where it really doesnt need to happen the visuals effects cast and adaptation from herberts classic are all fine but the awkward bisection at neither a high or low point in the narrative gave the ending a jarring unpleasantinthelamestwaypossible sourness
Feb 14 2022,positive,a visually stunning masterpiece  a story that might feel incomplete only part 1 but what they did in the movie was outstanding  part 2 has a lot to live up to and if it does this could be one of the greatest  combined 2 films since the 3 combined lord of the rings films
Feb 14 2022,negative,boring i walked out after 40 minutes i should have left after 15 im a huge cinema buff and see all the films nominated for awards this all star cast were acting the script written for them fire the writers and the overpaid  director save your money
Feb 14 2022,negative,honestly dont know what all the hype was this movie was hella boring  other than the visuals this movie had nothing going for it
Feb 13 2022,negative,same plot as every movie terrible acting the story seems to be excessively summarized unnatural dialogues the worst star wars is better than this movie  i really dont understand all the hype around it
Feb 13 2022,positive,intriguing interesting concepts want toknowmore but please get there quicker
Feb 13 2022,positive,saw this in imax and while it was visually amazing i really couldnt understand what they were saying half the time maybe im in the minority  but i prefer the original
Feb 13 2022,negative,another movie with child actors who are incapable of making the story remotely believable
Feb 13 2022,positive,amazing i cant wait for the sequel could not take my eyes off the screen
Feb 13 2022,positive,masterful visual poetry a film that cooks at a slow pace and is enjoyed without rushing
Feb 13 2022,positive,ive heard people saying that its boring too long has a bad and disappointing ending and is only half the story 1 its not boring you just dont appreciate good film making and werent paying attention 2 its not too long you were just bored because of 1 3 the ending is not bad or disappointing it just needs the next movie and thats coming just be patient and of course it was only going to be half the story considering the book is pretty big and full of lore and interesting stuff there is no valid critisism against this movie imo perfectly made acted and deserves every nomination it gets
Feb 13 2022,negative,very confused not interesting waited two hours for one fight scene that was trash payed for zendaya and jason mamoa and saw them twice
Feb 13 2022,positive,well done definitely shares the characters from the book on the screen will see again and plan tonrewatch before part ii is out
Feb 12 2022,negative,paul rudd was not in this movie
Feb 12 2022,positive,awesome and spectacular but one important note i found online dune is so widely acclaimed because it is not science fiction herbert eliminated  science  from its work no machines no computers such as to focus it on people their life adventure their cornelian dilemmas and mysticismoccultism
Feb 12 2022,positive,ive watched dune 2021 multiple times now and even started rereading the books this film just continues to grow on me with every viewing the film score might be the best of the year if not the best in many years i love the casting choices top to bottom and the imagery landscapes and ship designs leave a serious imprint on the imagination i have a feeling the upcoming dune films will eventually leave a classic film adaptation saga the likes of lord of the rings or the godfather etc how the director missed out on an oscar nomination is beyond me
Feb 12 2022,negative,this movie is awful and might appeal to a select few fans of the book ratings here are highly inflated very possible critics were bribed dont waste your timethis is not even better than the worst marvel movie
Feb 12 2022,positive,dune is one of the best scifi films ever made kudos to director denis villeneuve for delivering a masterclass in cinematography sound and cgi especially how he seamlessly blends cgi with natural cinematography great costumes and sets everything about it epic 1010
Feb 12 2022,positive,alright next scene oh wait its over    while yes someone may argue that the book of dune is way too large to be confined in 23 hours and you may be right but this one could have still ended on a better note a more fulfilling note it could have ended showing the character development of paul but all it did was make me confused its alright
Feb 11 2022,positive,when i first had watched it i was very amazed by how well done this movie had been created   here are what i loved about it  1 the build up to dune 2 and dune messiah   it starts slow however there is some action in the dune movie but it was more focused on storytelling and building up the next two dune movies   2 cast played their characters to perfection  dave batista former wwe champion turned actor although he had very little screen time he played his character well and will probably be someone that is important later on in the next two movies   oscar isaac poe dameron from star wars and apocalypse from xmen as the main characters father he played his character very well he is an amazing actor and had done an amazing job as the protagonists father   and last but not least timothee chalamet he did amazingly well as paul in dune and his acting in this movie is one of his best yet  3 the visual effects special effects imagery photography  both were amazing it made me feel like wow holy cow this is awesome it was like it was real   4 conclusion  towards the end of the movie it sets up the big war between the protagonists and antagonists in the next two movies my theory is that the final battle will be in messiah as it ends with a cliffhanger it made fans yearn for more dune     in other words this movie was denis villeneuves finest piece of art and i cannot wait for dune part 2 and dune messiah
Feb 11 2022,positive,the first act of the adventures of paul atreides is a film that will risk burdening the casual viewer on the other hand it is difficult not to label it as a wise attempt to propose excellent cinema in a historical moment in which entertainment is often an end in itself itself is synonymous with big box office takings  and if the film sometimes seems to want to venture daring parallels with the reality of some countries of the far east of our present often exploited by other western nations for their resources present in the territory it is also true that villeneuves project summarizes almost to perfection an immortal work which has now become a legend  and even for this alone there is to be grateful for this part one
Feb 11 2022,positive,such a great movie
Feb 11 2022,neutral,it was a average film but dragged the timing was all off
Feb 11 2022,negative,this film was long and was not oscar worthly the dp and the cgi was great but with all that i was still wanting a simple story of good and bad not a threesum he said she said and the end was laughable timmy is just too small to fight big guys and the never paid off the best part of the film zendaya
Feb 11 2022,positive,extraordinary moviemaking  i wonder why this movie was being mentioned for an oscar and after watching it i know why  this story  and its execution  blows every other space film ive seen to date out of the water    yes there are some issues with some of the earthly references the mahdi kris knife and some of the ideas are a tad cliche and the fact that everyone is still fighting with knives in the year 10491 is kind of weird the cool instanton armor makes up for it but the stories being told are extremely engaging very well directed and the casting and acting is just superb  outofthisworld
Feb 11 2022,positive,a fine start to the story did just enough chalemet is fine but i cant kick the feeling that hes a mopy looking teenager my one gripe is that dune borrows a lot from previous sci to hits like star wars and the matrix so this really isnt groundbreaking
Feb 10 2022,positive,easily the best sci fi movie since the matrix    abridged review total escapism 5 star movie i loved how the worms moved to the music dark exotic slightly frightening at times  was that a pg13    this seems to have what has been lacking from filmmaking for the past 30 years excellent music acting make up and special effects combined not just falling back on cgi  im thinking early 80s fantasy films like labyrinth legend and a few others  from the first alien language sequence dreams are the voices of the deep the film commits totally to the realm of fantasy albeit in a sci fi genre
Feb 10 2022,positive,this movie is a masterpiece the acting the music the set design the script everything is spectacular a must watch
Feb 10 2022,neutral,if you saw the first one  you wiil be bored with this one
Feb 10 2022,negative,very boring the pace of the movie is slow the dialogues are slurred i dont understand all the hype about this movie
Feb 10 2022,negative,is this the longest and most boring perfume commercial im pretty sure the zendaye shots were leftovers from her perfume commercial because all she did was pose for the camera throughout the movie but who can blame her when at most only 3 things happened in 3 hours of my time besides being painfully boring the horrible arabic pronunciation was really annoying and so was the fact that the arab coded characters were all portrayed by non arabsamericans the use of an islamic concept the mahdi on a white saviour was also very offensive how is this okay    the costumes and cinematography were really nice but otherwise the movie was a waste of time
Feb 10 2022,positive,its good  had its moment     the soundtrack is superb
Feb 10 2022,positive,my personal choice for movie of the year and it achieves this position quite easily at that
Feb 10 2022,negative,soooooooooo slooooooooow like with denis villeneuves last film blade runner 2049 its a 90 minute story dragged over 150 minutes   i saw this on imax and it looks beautiful the effects are top notch the sound design was good and the acting from almost every one is great   oscar isaacs played it great as a man who knows shits about to get fucky but goes along with it anyway as thats what is expected of him i expected timothée chalamet to just be a whining little bitch but even he was good as a man torn between doing what is expected and not wanting to live any the lives that have been laid out for him by so many different people just wanting to run off with the sand people and his sexy dream girl   the main problem which almost wipes out all of the good parts is that it is in serious need of editing it is not a slow burn with a great pay off at the end because it doesnt end merely pauses it is just overly long and gets boring if it had been edited down by only a small amount it could have been an excellent film but when you start checking news apps on your phone in the cinema for something interesting to read then you know youre onto a loser
Feb 10 2022,positive,dune is an audiovisual masterpiece and it has some incredible sequences i only wish all of this was in favor of a more interesting and investing storyline
Feb 9 2022,positive,great setup  really like timothee chalomet  cant wait to see part 2
Feb 9 2022,negative,tried to watch it got lost was told this movie is for fans of the book that it makes sense to them any movie based on a book that fails to pull in someone who has never read a page of the book is a failure
Feb 9 2022,positive,i remember being confused by the original and had that feeling with this one as well  not bad by any means but not great  i would watch it again just not too soon
Feb 9 2022,positive,never seen them do something like this before great visuals and an astonishing soundtrack to go with it
Feb 8 2022,positive,although slow at times and ending on a cliff hanger dunes makes up for any short comings with great performances beautiful cinematography brilliant special affects and a monumental musical score by hans zimmer
Feb 7 2022,negative,i was excited to watch the movie however the movie was so bad the acting was near terrible and there were many plot points that i couldnt follow i really hated that i could not hear a word the people said and i also hated that pretty much ever character died except for the two i hate the mothers acting and i hated even more that zendaya who is in half of every single trailer only got like 15 total minutes of screen time in a two hour long move
Feb 7 2022,positive,it follows the book very closely so knowing what s going to happen makes me really want to see the 2nd one because that s when the action happens and the speed picks up this first one felt like watching sand for hours on end with a dosis of joey tribiani smell the fart close ups beautifully done but tedious when you ve read the books
Feb 7 2022,positive,a visionary comes through once again in perhaps his greatest cinematic accomplishment yet its a film i want to make sure all of my friends have seen its that remarkable 
Feb 7 2022,negative,what a disappointment after all of the hype and build up same old storyline same old dialogue same old sets effects cgi a mishmash of a dozen better films seen before
Feb 7 2022,negative,i just finished the 12 movie and disappointed the whole movie was only the first part maybe i am too hooked on the old dune movie because it had some fine cast and special effects to go along with it so i must admit i was disappointed so i have to rate this at 2 stars only
Feb 7 2022,neutral,way too long and way too slow for me
Feb 7 2022,negative,the new dune has strayed far from the old i guess its a new dune for a new age 
Feb 7 2022,positive,villeneuve does a masterful job here as do the cast if youre just looking for another marvelesque popcornmovie that has little weight or depth to it this movie might not be for you of course there is still plenty of action in this film to drink up but thankfully not the kind that seeks to impress a preteen audience and the same can be said of the screenplay dune is not dumbeddown for a wider audience appeal it handles its complexities and convergent themes well and is as thoughtprovoking as it is entertaining
Feb 7 2022,positive,as a stand alone movie based on a scifi classic it was excellent the most entertaining movie in years i did not want it to end and hope there will be a series like star wars
Feb 6 2022,positive,dune is a terrific adaptation that leaves me antsy for the second installment denis villeneuve wisely adapts only the first half of the large novel and focuses most of his attention on the characters this makes dune an accessible but still very complicated film denis also does a great job of turning the literary nature of dune into a truly cinematic experience this is a visual treat that begs to be viewed on large screens anything too small and you will be doing yourself a disservice this film deserves at least oscar nominations for its cinematography and visual effects it isnt an overstatement to say it leaves you breathless many times every actor also turns in great performances rebecca ferguson and timothée chalamet are particularly memorable though it can struggle a bit with the source material cutting some integral scenes and information the changes are mostly beneficial dune truly is a breathtaking adaptation that will leave you thirsting for the second half score  a
Feb 6 2022,negative,horriblehorriblehorrible 
Feb 5 2022,negative,this movie was mechanical dull and too melancholy the somber background music didnt help     rebecca ferguson was plain and unattractive she lacked the stunning beauty and charisma of her predecessor francesca annis
Feb 5 2022,positive,watch it you wont regret it
Feb 5 2022,positive,a massive fan of the book and the 1984 filmso im a touch biased i feel like this film was made for the fans by the fans its been a long time since i was so amazed at what we can see at the cinema
Feb 5 2022,positive,really like the story and the visual effects of this movie a bit slow at some points but one of the best scifi movies of the last couple years
Feb 4 2022,positive,vision of masterpiece
Feb 3 2022,negative,very dull slow nothing happened ive never seen so many people get their phones out to check the time when will it end did i forget to say it was very dull
Feb 3 2022,negative,sorry but for me this was a colossal bore the lynch version with all its flaws at least had distinctive visual design and an artists idiosyncratic vision the machinery the costumes the sets and approach to the material villeneuves hazy sandy look and drably dressed players may be closer to the source material and his casting is certainly impressive but he fails to bring the story or characters to vivid life his blade runner sequel was equally shallow in terms of artistic insight despite having a more provocative premise than the original     also missing here are any standout performances at least the lynch film had some entertaining and unforgettable characterizations that didnt just go overthetop they left the top far far below baron harkonnen and rabban were particularly scenery chewing and broadly performed but at least they were absurdly bad in a fun way no this version played exactly like what it was part 1 of a larger project its just a long dull set up in which not much of interest happens hope part 2 is better or at least less of a waste of time
Feb 3 2022,negative,how it has 90 by audiences is crazy very uneventful and unexciting 
Feb 2 2022,positive,this is the greatest movie of all times the soundtrack is exquisite the cinematography reminds you of lawrence of arabia the characters are stoic and yet explode with powerful emotion when necessary you will be blown away by this movie
Feb 2 2022,positive,its an amazing movie all over the acting the cinematography the vision the casting ugh so great  i mean its been such a long time time since the last time i saw a really great movie 
Feb 2 2022,positive,cant wait for the second part
Feb 2 2022,positive,overall a good first installment of a two or three episode story pros good characters sweeping action and so on cons they skip a lot of character development that was in the book does it matter if you never read the book the omissions probably dont matter we saw it in imax at kent station the sound is excessively loud to the point of harshness and distortion much of the film is in soft focus and the color palette is washed out and unnatural im really tired of scifi movie directors thinking that fuzzy focus and sepiaintoblue color is somehow cool it doesnt seem to matter which planet the story takes place on it must have an almost twotone tint bah
Feb 2 2022,positive,best scifi movie ever and we are huge star wars fans and marvel fans this was fantastic no clue how the reviews were low great movie and the family and i can hardly wait for the next one to come out
Feb 1 2022,negative,predictable and overrated
Feb 1 2022,positive,great but nothing like the book it fails on that level but as a standalone its beautiful music is beautiful and the story is ok
Feb 1 2022,positive,acting and cinematography were great but sometimes the dramatic sounds were too loud i couldnt hear the dialog
Feb 1 2022,positive,watched it in digital was boring saw it in imax was so good i would recommend it only in imax
Feb 1 2022,negative,an half film really slow and spend a lot of time in a single battle maybe the next film can improve the quality this is just boring
Jan 31 2022,positive,impressive as a cinematic experience and pretty reliable as far as adaptations go ferguson is exactly how i imagined lady jessica when i read the book so that didnt hurt either
Jan 31 2022,positive,great movie great acting great special effects
Jan 31 2022,positive,theres no doubt that dune is an incredible piece of cinema its exciting effects sequences as well as the costumes and similar astonishing elements made the movie a spectacle to watch however its lack of likeable characters and a gripping story unfortunately would turn off the majority of average moviegoers
Jan 31 2022,positive,great story great cast great staging awesome in imax but only if you enjoy science fiction if you do not as my wife doesnt you will squirm in your seat for two and a half hours also helps if you watched the previous productions and have some feel for the story line spectacular effects and scaling
Jan 31 2022,positive,dune 2021 is overall a good movie the worst that i can say about it is that at times it can be overwhelming at times with just how large of a story is set up which can make it hard to follow at times but not very often overall i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and its large cast of all stars i could not find a bad performance among the cast which is impressive especially with as star studded and large as it is the effects are great and you can tell that great time and care went into the production design and effects while bringing this world to life i cannot imagine how hard it must have been taking on this massive story and i am so glad that it is split up into multiple parts as it will give the audience time to rewatch and fully grasp the scope of both the characters and story all in all dune delivers exactly as promised a huge adventure and story set in a fully realized world and i cant wait for part 2 i give dune a 910
Jan 30 2022,positive,note this review is posted before 2022 oscar nominations are released i watched and reviewed over 30 movies predicted to be in the mix for best pic best director and the four acting awards    fair disclosure i love denis villeneuve movies my fave director so i have trouble knowing how much of that predisposition causes me to say dune part one is a top3 movie for 2021  its gorgeous just lovingly constructed moment to moment  it completely transports you to its universe  i also appreciate how the moviemakers had to make dune seem different from star wars when george lucas basically stole star wars from dune    but i have one fault for it  by adhering so closely to a book from decades ago dune gives us yet another recycled white man savior movie  if they didnt want to make paul a paula and have zendaya as the lead actor at least they might have thought about making house of atreides not be white people  i dont mean necessarily black or brown but its sci fi  so what about green purple striped just not luke jr
Jan 30 2022,positive,i was really eager to watch this movie and at the same time a wee bit concerned because i knew that i would be hugely disappointed if it turned out to be another movie massacring a classic source material    i have to admit that it was a very long time since i read the dune books but i have to say that the movie was mostly true to the books as i remember them and also reasonably free of agenda driven rubbish apart from the odd replacement of some characters with gender correct ones for no real good reason    there is really not much point in me saying much about the story it should be well known for any science fiction fan and it is a great story and really good material for a big screen movie despite some critics at rotten tomatoes moaning about it and calling it unwieldly etc probably too big a book with too many words for the small agenda driven brains of rotten tomatoes critics no surprise there    the movie as a whole is wonderful to watch the scenery is oftentimes very beautiful and the décor the buildings the machinery is very well done i was surprised that the world of caladan was portrayed as a rather austere scottish looking landscape but after getting over the initial surprise it worked very well actually    i also like that the harkonnen especially the baron are not turned into some exaggerated comical figures but although disgusting and despicable they are actual humans    overall the casting was quite good and everyone played their roles well at the beginning i felt that paul was a bit too wimpy from what i remember of the book he was quite well trained and skilled already from the start but he picked up as the movie went along    it is a science fiction borderline fantasy movie so there should be some special effects right this is a difficult movie to make special effects for since this universe is a weird mix between futuristic science fiction fantasy elements and oldfashioned traditions    i have to say that they succeeded quite well though the atmosphere felt just right ships spice harvesters buildings looked cool and fitting the story the way they implemented the personal shields was very nice they didnt go overboard on special effects and weird designs the ornithopter was of course totally ridiculous from a scientific point of view but at least it looked pretty cool    if i should complain about something although that is not the fault of the movie but of the source material i have never understood how in a universe which is obviously driven by hidden agendas machinations and assassinations the atreides could just pick up everything leave their home and put all their important eggs in one basket at arrakis    one more small thing that i could complain about would of course be that we now have to wait two years from what i have read until we get to watch the next movie to get to the part were the really cool stuff happens    bottom line this was movie is definitely in there vying for the title best movie that i have watched this year
Jan 30 2022,positive,the film is executed to perfection the visual effects are stunningly mindblowing no other words
Jan 30 2022,positive,absolutely incredible in imax
Jan 30 2022,positive,beautifully filmed and excellent sound productionediting as with most denis villeneuve films he does a great job of creating atmosphere and the desert of arrakis looks stunning really great build up of the messiah prophecies and the mystery of the fremen society my only beef is with the silly sword battle scenes  just dont need josh brolins or jason momoas heroics gave it 35 stars on first viewing watched it again a few months later  that was too harsh as the large battle scenes are a minor part of the whole thoroughly enjoyable vision of this story
Jan 29 2022,positive,mysterious gorgeous captivating isnt powered by lazy gc violence its the best rendition of the book cant wait for the sequel if there is one
Jan 29 2022,positive,cant wait for a second movie great acting and great visuals
Jan 29 2022,positive,its a good movie it looks and feels amazing for book fanatics it might seem a bit surface level plenty of room for improvement in the sequel looking forward to it
Jan 29 2022,neutral,i had high hopes for this movie because it was hyped so much but for me it did not deliver on the emotional side of things there was so little character information and development that i could have cared less if any or all of the characters died in this film the only bright spot is the character of chani played by zendaya it was weird but when she was brought into the scene it elevated the storyline
Jan 29 2022,positive,stunning moving long time scifi fan and this is a masterpiece
Jan 28 2022,positive,an incredible scifi film youll get lost in the story is very well executed with beautiful and artistic sounds and visuals i cant wait for the 2023 sequel
Jan 28 2022,positive,best superproduction ive seen during the pandemics full immersion  mask in cinema never felt so right 
Jan 28 2022,positive,fantastic being a huge fan of the book i was expecting a lot and the film didnt disappoint there is a perfect balance between effective character building and epic imagery neither of which were going to be simple given the depth of the source material if i had any criticism it would be that the sardaukar could have been a more intimidating and that the harkonnen invasion of arrakis could have been built up more as it felt a little rushed in any event the film stayed close to the book and was hugely entertaining cant wait for part 2
Jan 28 2022,positive,its the type of movie that is long but necessarily so it is a lot to take in but the scale of its world and characters is enthralling such a beautiful and epic scifi grand story film so much better than the 1984 version it was worth the rent and i am confident for a quality follow up sequel
Jan 27 2022,positive,very book accurate which is a yes for me
Jan 27 2022,positive,the movie was long but it was interesting the entire time  i havent read the book or seen the prior dune from the 1980s and i had no trouble following the story  its a little confusing at the beginning with all the strange names but the different factions become clear as you watch  cant wait for part 2
Jan 27 2022,positive,its a very good looking movies with a ok story i am hyped for part 2
Jan 26 2022,positive,it had a breathtaking atmosphere and the very talented actors just completed the movie
Jan 26 2022,positive,best actors how they play chalamet awesome
Jan 25 2022,positive,loved it its not often a remake does justice to the original will probably watch this over and over just like the original its epic in scope and size and the acting is spot on
Jan 25 2022,positive,great telling of the story  excellent first book
Jan 25 2022,positive,thanks heavens for cgi as this is so much better then the 1980s version  epic
Jan 24 2022,positive,good movie but something is missing those round spaceships are little bit weird im not sure about the cast and the atreides die very fast like in two days they are here which is far longer in the books
Jan 24 2022,negative,meh it passed the time is the best preset review thanks rotten for such sophisticated vocabulary i would expect any more from this site   it literally is just that every time the actors speak you are counting the minutes to the next action scene this should have been a video game the dialogue is terrible and the casting chalamet as the emperor of the universe lmao oh please  the action makes it worthwhile to coverup for the cringe moments
Jan 24 2022,positive,a litttle bit more background would have been helpful cinematography was great good casting
Jan 23 2022,negative,pretty ordinary and senseless some good visuals though
Jan 23 2022,positive,excellent one of the best movies i have seen in years they did an amazing job with the pacing the subtle looks the atmosphere the dialogue actor choices everything it was not some dumb flashy action movie and that is part of what made it so unique and interesting 10 out of 10 would highly recommend
Jan 23 2022,positive,the only draw back is that its 2 hours 35 minutes
Jan 22 2022,positive,fantastic cant wait for part 2
Jan 22 2022,negative,another scifi alternate universe that fails to connect on an emotional level stellar cast and visual effects but no power punch  wasted 2 12 hours of my life and its only part 1 dear god
Jan 22 2022,negative,dune 2021 part 1 review  im a dune fanatic  watched the original movie when it came out  played the computer game for hours  hours i had high hopes for this new version but felt so deflated at the end i was driven to leave my first review on rotten tomatoes the storytelling effects visuals  soundtrack are actually very good  worth seeing but it should have been a one off 3hr epic not a 2 part drawn out bore by the time the sequel comes out most of us will have forgotten the plot multipart movies are just cynical ploys to draw as much money out of the audience as possible movies should provide an evening of entertainment not leave you feeling cheated at the end it could have been up there with the best scifi movies had they not been so greedy and broken it up such a shame i would recommend watching both parts together when part 2 eventually comes out late 2023
Jan 22 2022,positive,visually breathtaking i could not fault this film if i tried
Jan 21 2022,positive,yes it is good i still love the version of lynch but people who have not read the books find it incomprehensibleit is just not possible to put the whole story into one film a trilogy would do it more justice the reaction of my son 19 was telling    is this older than star wars or game of thrones yes ok than its good   the casting is great apart from jessica who looks too ypung nevermind her bene gesserit background and although it follows the book closely a lot remains untold i will wait for part 2 before i judge
Jan 21 2022,positive,visuals and sounds are impressive which give an epic experience à la star wars im so glad to have seen it on the big screen    the story is not complicated but the universe is rich and well developped it has a game of thrones feeling when it comes to political mysteries and tricks    the main down point is the apparant lack of reactions of the protagonist  he was too stoic it reminds me of the protagonist of tenet just following a course of events without really questionning it    i would say that this film is entertaining it lacks maybe a more dynamic pace
Jan 21 2022,positive,im a big dune nerd and loved every minute of the film
Jan 21 2022,positive,so long since i read the books and i read all the books and even some of the prequels so it was a pleasant surprise to enjoy it so much only thing missing was the space guild navigators they seem to have been replaced by star gates good acting all round and it looks awesome
Jan 21 2022,neutral,it felt like every other futuristic movie out there nothing really makes it stand out its slow the characters werent compelling and visually the colouring made it hard to watch also why are half the lines whispered
Jan 21 2022,positive,amazing movie i cant wait second part
Jan 20 2022,negative,uninspiring and poorly thought through adaptation of the classic scifi novel well part of it the story has been altered and some of the best things in it left out or glossed over other elements of the story are not well explained so a little too short in some places and too long in others there are lots of repetitive flash forwards as well which become irritating good acting and special effects pass the time but it does not capture the spirit or continued relevance of the book very well in relation to religion exploitation etc etc some is signalled but little is made of it worth a miss unless you are a special effects buff in which case it is worth seeing i didnt want to wait to see some of the best bits of the second half of the book either a failure of direction and conception more than a production or technical failure
Jan 19 2022,positive,set design technology costumes etc all lead to an immersive world that drew me in and kept me hooked even when the plot slogged a bit it could have benefitted on either a shorter run time or more focus on the the more interesting elements of the world id prefer the latter just because of how much i was drawn in to the overall world would definitely be into a sequel
Jan 19 2022,positive,solid movie but some parts were a little confusing where the story expected or assumed you would know ahead of time
Jan 19 2022,positive,this is by far the best movie of 2021
Jan 19 2022,positive,a bit slow but still captivating great acting graphics and plot excited to see what comes next
Jan 19 2022,positive,it is not easy to talk about this type of film with this degree of complexity since it is an adaptation of a very extensive story and knowing that it is not the first attempt to bring it to the big screen we know that it must be to see from a different point of view even so i think they achieve the task introduce the public to this world follow this story they prepare the ground well for what is to come we are not talking about effects and photography very good in all those aspects
Jan 18 2022,positive,a good start to an amazing book series acting and cinematography were great sfx and ship designs were cool didnt like the abrupt ending felt like it needed more time to set up the next movie
Jan 18 2022,positive,kinda boring and resembling star wars the force awakens a bit too much perfectly shot though
Jan 18 2022,positive,it is a great movie with incredible direction cinematography score and performances across the board the ones that stand out are tiomthee chalamet and rebecca ferguson who have a great dynamic as a motherson duo a very solid introduction to the world of dune which has us all very excited for the continuation of the story
Jan 18 2022,positive,an incredible feat of storytelling and cinema denis villeneuve does unthinkable justice to the source material not only managing to tell the complex story or the first half of it but also building the world of dune and arrakis as the story unfolds visually incredible with an unbelievable score from hans zimmer  perhaps his best  each and every character is perfectly cast but to me this is jason momoas best performance josh brolin oscar isaac rebecca ferguson and stellan skarsgard among others surround the hero paul atreides timothee chalamet with equally strong performances   my 1 movie of 2021
Jan 18 2022,positive,not what i was expecting but fantastic story huge scale spectacular cgi just stellar performance by all the actors ready for the next 
Jan 18 2022,positive,the construction of the film was slow but it was necessary to build this vast universe
Jan 18 2022,negative,trades off dialog and story line for loud music if i hadnt read the book or seen the previous dune movie i wouldnt have had any idea what the story was about even inserts one bit of locker room humor in something that is the darkest story i have ever read really didnt fit at all
Jan 17 2022,negative,i kept thinking it would get better but it didnt my 13 year old was disappointed also
Jan 17 2022,positive,dune is the the first of a planned twopart adaptation of the 1965 novel by frank herbert set in the far future it follows paul atreides as his family the noble house atreides is thrust into a war for the deadly and inhospitable desert planet arrakis the ensemble cast is impressive cinematography is so beautifully done its almost like an art film in spite of being slowpaced it doesnt bore the audience because the story is interesting and the characters are captivating  i like how they didnt cram everything into one movie and just opted for a twopart saga the special effects are spotless and the battle scenes are epic  one might notice some similarities to star wars and game of thrones because of the plot grandeur politics and wardrobe overall its a very impressive excellentlymade adaptation
Jan 17 2022,positive,as someone vaguely familiar with the source material i cannot make an adequate comparison between the too but as far as a film on its own merit dune boasts plenty of impressive visuals as well as an all star cast that has me clamoring for a sequel  denisvilleneuve proves again that he is the current king of scifi and dune is another extraordinary addition to his filmography
Jan 16 2022,negative,i have walked out on 1 movie to date 1984 dune despite hopes 2021 was close to a walkout relentlessly boring convoluted opaque endlessly melancholy with pretentions of selfimportance watch our 105 lb effeminate hero fly his wasp ship use his sacred 12th century sword to slay tube worms and all pretenders to the throne of all that is silly fortunately i did not have to walk out for this one turned this unbearable vapid trite off
Jan 16 2022,positive,this transposition is awesome you can really feel the love and accuracy that director villeneuve has put in the movie visually astounding with a great plot it sets the foundation for the next chapters and thats why its slow paced its a mix between a blockbuster movie and an author one the fans will surely be excited but it will be hard for the general public to understand it a minor critic goes to the characters i was unable to make a strong bond with them but it will probably happen in the following movies
Jan 16 2022,negative,very boring kind of like watching a perfume commercial over and over again
Jan 16 2022,negative,movie about spices   boring   would rather watch grass
Jan 16 2022,positive,i havent read the book so i cant tell is the film a good adaptaion or not however taken as a standalone entity it is really good    weve got competent cast performing well or very well impressive visual effects atmospheric music and coherent story     you definitely should  watch it
Jan 16 2022,positive,this movie is a prime example of a deep story that demands your attention it certainly isnt a mindless flick to turn your brain off every detail matters my sister and i walked out of this saying wowthat was so good the story was so compelling that it was all we spoke of driving home a nearperfect scifi film already want to see the sequel
Jan 16 2022,positive,your average movie goer today wont like it  they are trained by superhero movies and how contemporary films are formatted to allow for the goldfish attention spans of the masses  this is a film for actual adults of all ages  those able to accept the dark the hushed tones the imperceptible dialogue and complex storyline  rarely i have to turn on subtitles and this is a film where it is an advantage   as a youth i read the book and discovered what it meant to be transported into a distant world  the book was amazing  i rolled my eyes at david lynches version his twisted view of this world and the odd way he portrayed it was far from the books intent  villeneuve found a way to tell it in an understandable way without cutting out too much  i look forward to the second part
Jan 16 2022,positive,cinematography is taken to the next level in this unique science fiction thriller
Jan 16 2022,positive,a visually beautiful movie great pacing and a great score once again by hanz zimmer forgive me if i misspelled his name im glad this was not another all action and no writing type of blockbuster this is how scifi is done right
Jan 16 2022,positive,with director denis villeneuve at the helm and an incredible cast at his disposal dune has all the talent in all the right places making it not just a spectacular visual feast but also a fantastically shot engaging scifi that creates a unique world full of interesting characters and great action setpieces im having a blast getting to know the universe that frank herbert created as seen through the eyes of for my money one of the best directors of this era its not perfect and i do feel like the film is better enjoyed if you are already familiar with the source material but villeneuve and his cowriters have done an admirable job in giving people with no prior knowledge of anything dune just enough information to work with so as not to be totally confused still if youre like me and youve never read the original book nor seen the 1984 film youre going to have to concentrate harder to follow exactly whats happening and just accept the fact that its going to feel like youre missing a lot of backstory in almost every area
Jan 15 2022,negative,unnecessarily long and boring storyline
Jan 15 2022,positive,intriguing creates its own world leaves you curious to see what happens in following movies
Jan 15 2022,positive,its been said a lot and ill say it again game of thrones scifi dueling families grand scale dropping you into a massive world and much like got i sometimes felt like i needed cliff notes and while i was intrigued as hell by this opening i cant help but feel the next chapter will be that much grander its a massive story told massively and i am intrigued by it but it is a first chapter however in terms of first chapters its pretty damn good the sheer scope is enthralling and the visuals are stunning not just that the way the visuals tell the story and the acting every actor knocks it out of the park its great but there is this lingering feeling that the next one will be better
Jan 15 2022,positive,i have never read the books but this movie is awesome cgi amazing consuming yes left me very excited and searching for when part 2 is coming out duh one of the best movies to have come out in the last few years 
Jan 15 2022,positive,this was absolutely brilliant the way they captured the scale and grandness of the empire and the desert were perfectly executed this has to be one the best screenplays based off the source material they balanced the plot character development and action flawlessly if you can  this is a movie worthy of an imax screen
Jan 15 2022,negative,timothèe chalamet did an exceptional job in this film i watched this movie with my family and we all got very bored very quickly i honestly do not remember anything really that happened in it and o just saw it i was very disappointed 
Jan 15 2022,positive,you cant say it doesnt have a singular vision even if its not everyones cup of tea
Jan 15 2022,positive,finally a well thought out and original scifi film although it leaves you hanging it is a wonderful film and i cant wait for part 2
Jan 15 2022,positive,fabulous and honours the book albeit not a substitute for rereading and loving again the great work that is dune
Jan 14 2022,positive,dune brings you into the dystopian sci fi world where empires battle on distant planets by the end of the film you are truly immersed into this world in terms of worldbuilding dune excels in dune part 2 i would love to expand upon the action and true chaos of the planet dune
Jan 14 2022,negative,everyone is talking about the originality of this story lets analyze spice is oil desert planet is middle east freman are arabs atreides are british harkonens are russians common leaders name is vladimir spice used for travel and medicine so is oil they can build giant ships with ftl drive and tiny assassin drones laser and guided missiles but use swords no no machetes for war they have shield s but cannot stop a blade which they use for killing so should i go on this story has no originality whatsoever you dont believe me read the world history you may find it more interesting 
Jan 13 2022,positive,i really liked this i know its the first part of 2 and really long but it was well done    the acting was great the cinematography was excellent it stayed as true to the book as a movie could be i think these books are very detailed with a lot of inner monologues    i bought this 4k uhd and i highly recommend it on that platform it looks and sounds absolutely stunning
Jan 13 2022,positive,hopefully we will get a trilogy or more fantastic new franchise
Jan 13 2022,positive,good as i am a story fan not great cast  and some effects not as memorable as 1984 version
Jan 13 2022,negative,the most beautiful movie ive ever fallen asleep to
Jan 13 2022,positive,arguably the greatest cinematic experience since lotr return of the king  with jaw dropping cinematography spectacular performances and sound design that will shake you to your core dune is everything you want in modern cinema     dune uses its long run time to  wade capably through its compelling and intricate source material and presents a brilliant foundation for its conclusion coming in 2023 there are some details that are lost in the mix the esoteric names of characters and titles in a foreign language can sometimes be missed but would be cleared up easily with a subtitles you cant quite make out exactly what they are saying but the phrase is repeated enough for you to understand what is being referred to     denis villeneuve has mastered the presentation of scale and the sheer size of the world of dune is a masterpiece in its own right the monstrously huge ships cities creatures and numbers in dune are a sight to behold and so well articulated on the screen   what was most compelling was the sound both in design and the score bone shaking chants prayers screams and sound effects underscored by the ineffable hans zimmer topped of this beacon of cinema     immediately worth a rewatch that cant come soon enough
Jan 12 2022,positive,its great so far i love the changes they did make and the things they kept timothee chalamet was fantastic 
Jan 11 2022,positive,excellent adaptation of the story  big brilliant scenes plot is fairly light and doesnt address a lot of the book but overall well worth a watch and i look forward to the second movie of the book
Jan 11 2022,positive,they did an excellent job creating the universe  beautiful cinematography  very epic  acting was great  very fun film
Jan 11 2022,positive,effects were good but with a very dry storyline
Jan 11 2022,positive,it was a good time and well shot
Jan 10 2022,negative,dont understand the hype slow and confusing
Jan 10 2022,positive,ive finally seen dune i hesitated because frank herberts dune together with its first two sequels are on my list of most loved scifi novels it is a novel i first read when i was still in my teens which is a very long time ago dune is a concept dense story set in a galaxy spanning empire on a desert planet arrakis aka dune the film successfully drops us into this world and introduces its main elements  the empire its ruling rival clans the harkonnens and the atreides the conspiritorial wise women the bene gesserit and the fremen tuned to the rhythms of their planet some may be disappointed in that the two and a half hour film covers only the beginning of the story and presents itself as part 1 but for me this was perfect i look forward to part 2 and hope that the film will inspire those who havent done so to read the book
Jan 10 2022,positive,as a dune fan i was eager to see the movie and was also thinking it will be a disappointment this helped a lot not to get disappointed i like the movie   however if you read the books dont expect the adaption itself to be good regarding politics and characters the movie is just a thin juice made of dune part one extract droplets
Jan 9 2022,positive,we finally have the technical skills and the budget to do justice to the book the visual effects and the sound are amazing and the movie adaptation deviates only slightly from the original plot i only found duke leto not well characterized as the book
Jan 9 2022,positive,soundtrack is amazing visually sets a world apart from other sci fi franchises acting was good timothy and rebecca especially
Jan 9 2022,positive,i was surprised to learn that the pacing of this current version was more intone with the dune mini series which came out in 2000 so we can certainly expect at least another two installments apparently my original comments of watching the 2000 mini series were that parts of it were drawn out and boring although to be fair given it came out 21 years ago there would have probably been a lot less going on visually not to mention the cgi stuff would be borderline painful but i do remember i enjoyed the mini series on a whole with its story and some of its other elements so to me this recent installment has taken my memory of the mini series and given it a massive polish up with better acting cinematography and overall visuals
Jan 9 2022,positive,beautiful and epic you can feel the mood
Jan 9 2022,negative,how is it that this movie got such a good review this was a 3 hour prologue with no story line all it did was tell you who a couple characters are and who the antagonist will likely be this is pure greed just about making money star wars delivered this in its original prologue with the flying text for no extra money you may argue and say this is just part of a series but all other series have their own story arc and this has nothing it is a waste of 3 hrs
Jan 9 2022,positive,beutiful movies beautiful sceneries beutiful musice every scene is like one piece of art
Jan 9 2022,positive,one of the best if not the best movie of 2021 a modern scifi classic
Jan 9 2022,positive,the best movie of 2021
Jan 9 2022,positive,looking at the ratings i realize i definitely have different tastes than the average human as i loved the mitigated reviewed version of 1984 and not so much the highly rated version of 2021 even though the 2021 version is interesting because of the great story based on f herberts novel it is at least in my opinion very weak in comparison of pretty much every aspects of the 84 version including the casting except paul who is great in both versions the dialogues lost the intelligence character wisdom and regality it once had the acting lady jessica big thumb down the worms looking like prepuces with hair in mouth so definitely not anything as impressive and scary as they should be the music incredible soundtrack in 84 i also though we could have done without the big kissing between paul and shani thought the same of arwen and aragorn in lotr btw but it seems that some people seem to think subtlety is not in and the display of physical contact is necessary to convey deep feelings of love still looking forward part ii regardless being a huge fan of the story
Jan 9 2022,negative,paid 2999 to see half a movie that was extremely drawn out not happy about it if your not going to show the whole thing then let us know this so many scams out there now the entertainment industry is leading the way to the top tired of seeing movies that are just long advertisements to the next part shameful is all i can say shame on all of yea
Jan 8 2022,positive,it was really god but felt like half a movie i finished it and felt as if i only had seen a part of a story and when that happens i prefer it to be a series and not consecutive movies
Jan 8 2022,negative,its good but its confusing you need to pay attention if not then youll get so confused
Jan 8 2022,negative,things are confusingly moving at a very slow pace and that makes you lose interest pretty soon too long boring
Jan 8 2022,positive,real serious scifi here  everything about this movie is fantastic  turn up the volume
Jan 8 2022,positive,incredible visuals and artistry amazing conceptual design great acting and action along with a beautiful score villeneuve is truly the greatest scifi director of our time and i await all of his movies with baited breath
Jan 8 2022,positive,villeneuve is a genius and has been one since his early filmmaking days in montreal i have watched his career grow and develop and i feel there are few directors out there who have his ability to worldbuild and to get to the real truth which motivates his main characters no different with dune a moody haunting treat 
Jan 8 2022,positive,the first half of dune starts slowly owing to the fact that the films world building has no stakes in the first hour which may turn off some viewers but once the second half arrives you get the rich well fleshed out narrative you anticipate from this picture denis villeneuve gave us a jawdropping visual treat with rich and detailed costume and set designs mixed with stunning visuals as well as cinematography by greig fraser mesmerizing score by hans zimmer and an allstar cast including timotheé chalamet stellan skarsgrd and many others who gave their all for this grand epic science fiction adventure that should be seen on the big screen
Jan 8 2022,positive,from the first moment we learn to read we are hopefully destined to savor the voice and the in the head movie magic of storytelling that is frank herbert dune this movie plays like the movie in my head since i was seven im exceedingly proud of the due diligence and respect that was given to the authors voice i endeavor to hope they continue the series until its last its the real oasis of water in an ocean of sand we have all been looking for years
Jan 8 2022,positive,most accurate to the book  great intro to the series keep it up
Jan 8 2022,positive,fantastic story  beautiful videography  cant wait for the sequel
Jan 8 2022,neutral,spectacular but even at 25 hours runtime it would benefit from an extra hour too much stuff happening and not enough building the characters
Jan 7 2022,negative,havent watched a movie as boring as this one in a long time
Jan 7 2022,positive,dune is a great book and it along with its sequels are compelling reading however they are not short nor light reading and to make a decent version of the first book its hard to imagine doing anything other than making a miniseries this was one of several reasons why i hated the david lynch version from 1984 it crammed so much stuff into such a short film that it often was confusingand the director himself hated the film apparently the studio took the movie away from him and hacked it to piecesthus making it so confusing because of this i was not interested in seeing this 2021 versionuntil i learned it was only part one and the second film would complete the first dune book    so from the outset this film cant help but be better than the 1984 version but it manages to do something i didnt expectits actually too longor so it felt due to the pacing and ridiculous number of big scenes were not much happens but you see a lot of eye candyalong with very moody music in many ways it reminded me of the first star trek moviewhich was so long and tediousand had too many scenes where you just see a ship flying through space and in dune part one there are too many scenes like this and not enough emotion and dialog in other words it seems to need a more personal and human tough to make it a truly great film now i am not saying its bad or to avoid it but the film could have been tightened up a bit and paced better    fortunately if you have never read dune this film is approachable and does follow the book closely
Jan 7 2022,positive,i really enjoyed the film when i saw it in the cinema not being able to wait for part two i bought the trilogy and got into it as soon as possible one thing that i felt the film lacked after reading the books is the pain and strife that duke leto was going through knowing that something was about to happen the almost helplessness he felt could have given us some great acting scenes apart from that everything was great and the cinematography and soundtrack were incredible
Jan 7 2022,positive,epic movie with amazing photography and music the plot is complex and so the characters  cast is great especially   chalamet
Jan 7 2022,negative,oppressively boring  just feels like a setup for the planned sequel
Jan 7 2022,positive,an amazing adaptation of the original dune novel with some of the best cinematography in any film to date worth it for han zimmers music alone
Jan 7 2022,positive,the start of the movie was great amazing visuals accompanied with beautiful music and plenty of action however the movie slows down quite a bit after the halfway mark and lost a lot of the suspense
Jan 7 2022,positive,a really magical experience the costumes the lighting the adaptation of the book and the mystique that it contains
Jan 6 2022,positive,i still think this property is too dense for a movie and really deserves a long tv series but you couldnt ask for much more from a movie
Jan 6 2022,positive,while a lot of scifi adaptations nowadays feel like copies of the past villeneuves attempt feels like a breath of fresh air dune is daring beautiful and sometimes maybe a little bit too much to take in but at the end of the movie i only wanted more
Jan 6 2022,positive,for me the movie is quite nice and very interesting for character building i like how the storyline is not very cramped and just follow the flow of the story i am really excited about the next part
Jan 6 2022,positive,villeneuve has crafted an incredible scifi epic
Jan 6 2022,positive,this is the scifi epic i have been missing in my life  my only complaint if you can call it that is that the movie wrapped up before completing the story  villeneuve  co kept me so engaged and entertained the 25 hour movie felt short  i would without question welcome and extended edition ala lord of the rings  having read the book and seen the 1984 version it was a good point in the story to end the first movie  i am absolutely on the edge of my seat for the sequel and will see it on the first opportunity i have
Jan 6 2022,positive,excellent waiting for part 2
Jan 6 2022,positive,didnt read or watch the old stuff but i will now
Jan 5 2022,positive,this movie was only okay for me i would need to watch again to really understand it
Jan 5 2022,positive,everything is just perfect in this movie the views and the settings brilliant dialogues in every scene best cast selection with excellent performance of timothée chalamet  rebecca ferguson hans zimmers superb soundtrack the storytelling and of course the amazing images that are just well made watched it two times in theaters and i feel i should was gone for at least another one
Jan 5 2022,positive,a lot of it drags out a little too much with dreamy perfumecommerciallike sequences and soap opera drama but thats an inherent issue from the source villeneuve does a masterful job yet again of balancing that drama with interesting scifi action and drawing out excellent performances from his cast all around especially chalamet who i was skeptical about this whole time may be blasphemy to some but this blows the lynch version out of the water sorry not sorry
Jan 5 2022,positive,dune is a movie that requires total attention and patience despite being a blockbuster if you try to watch this film unpretentiously with a group of friends youll probably find it boring but if youre ready to watch it to enter deeply into that universe youll be gifted with one of the most sensory experiences of the year timothée chalamet made me lose all prejudices i had against him and finally convinced me as a great actor his eyes are possibly the most expressive ones of the year for me he deserves an oscar nomination rebecca ferguson is imposing despite discreet and oscar isaacs character remembered me of mufasa and argyle wallace zendaya is almost a mystic figure and i cant wait to see what shell do in part 2 which is already confirmed the botanic girl and the chinese doctor have good little arcs and josh brolin and jason momoa have interesting contrast some people can say the movie quite doesnt have a story firstly i also thought that but i understood the story was being told while this universe was being established its a story inside a worldbuilding
Jan 5 2022,positive,great story with weird pacing and an oddly unsatisfying ending everything else was pretty much fantastic
Jan 5 2022,positive,one of the best movies ive seen in the last 10 years flawless artistic brilliance that reminds us what movies especially sixfi and fantasy can and ought to be the next movie cannot come quickly enough
Jan 5 2022,positive,this movie was a great surprise great story great casting and keeps you entertained i wish the movie was longer
Jan 5 2022,negative,started slow moved slow and even at its peak the movie managed to still get ur me to sleep hard to follow and it plays upon chalamets looks to lead the movie
Jan 5 2022,neutral,hard to understand in the 1st hour but after then it got better355
Jan 4 2022,positive,about time a really well paced movie with an interesting storyline and an great music score to boot
Jan 4 2022,positive,best movie in a long time wonderful photography and amazing storytelling villaneuve is an awesome director this movie is an instant clasic
Jan 4 2022,positive,well aside from excellent photography costumes music and mostly great actors it seems like a prequel to something great but the thing is i needed it to be great from the beginning not put everything in the second film and just tease with excellence from time to time in this one
Jan 4 2022,negative,i had no idea what was going on throughout the entire movie i have never read dune so it went over my head obviously for people who are fans of the original series my biggest issue is that they whisper throughout the entire movie its like they need subtitles in the cinema
Jan 4 2022,negative,snooze fest 2021 great visuals very very slow
Jan 4 2022,positive,i was very entertained by dune i love the scenery cinematography and acting its not going to be one of my top 10 or even top 20 favorite movies but it does the job of entertaining
Jan 3 2022,positive,it happens occasionally where a film will be so completely unlike anything youve ever seen before for myself i can think of three the first is christopher nolans interstellar regardless of what others have to say about the story being too complicated or hard to understand i went into the theatre without any prior expectations or requirements that the film needed to meet and it still blew me away and remains one of my favorites the second is denis villeneuves 2016 alien invasion film arrival i will never forget watching it in the theatre it transformed me in a way no other film has the third is dune part i also directed by denis villeneuve entering the theatre with my love of arrival preparing me for another villeneuve masterpiece i was simply giddy then the sardaukar throat chant of dreams are messages from the deep blasted over the speakers i froze i was silent the alien sound of the quote sent me straight into the story completely and totally invested only about six seconds in villeneuve nails the feeling of being on another planet in another time and everything does feel incredibly foreign and different the unnatural pale skin of the harkonnens the glowing blue eyes of the fremen and the hooded veils of the bene gesserit caladan does have some strong similarities to earth but it is most likely to help the audience understand and empathize with the caladonian characters particularly paul and his family far better that being said the spaceships and technology are unlike anything in any filmever that is in large part due to the fantastic special effects this movie has to offer the sand worms especially appear absolutely terrifying and aweinspiring villeneuves cinematographer was greig fraser and he truly designs and executes some of the most beautiful shots in film history the performances of the actors in the film are as convincing and believable as the setting around them timothee chalamet who plays paul atreides delivers another spectacular performance his delivery and portrayal of the character gives paul so much depth and relatability his mother lady jessica played by rebecca ferguson is also an intensely emotional character whos arc reveals her as a brave fiercely loyal and deeply compassionate leader stellen skarsgard plays the evil baron vladimir harkonnen a hideous and violent imperialist who seeks to dominate the titular planet skarsgards performance for me is the best in the film despite only being present for around fifteen minutes in total the baron is a terrifying and hideous enemy who immediately fills the audience with fear this wouldnt be a fair review without mentioning hans zimmers simply perfect score the soundtrack is without a doubt sensational in every way imaginable the music conveys complicated and deep emotions sets the scene with intensity and vibrance and reveals hidden intentions and secrets its powerful moving and truly out of this world with its fantastic performances soundtrack and direction dune truly shows itself to be a remarkable achievement for everyone involved in its production this movie is unlike any youve ever seen before
Jan 3 2022,positive,outstanding movie with an allstar cast strong performances and a deep story with enough mystery to keep you hooked for the sequels one of the best movies of 2021
Jan 3 2022,positive,the best movie of the year denis villeneuve is the best director ever i loved this movie
Jan 3 2022,positive,a galactic opera best movie of the year
Jan 3 2022,positive,i just wish it was a complete34 hour film but what we did get was a nearperfect adaptation far exceeding the david lynch version     timothée chalamet and rebecca ferguson stand out in a wonderful cast the technical achievements of the film are unmatched for its year and denis villeneuve has directed a scifi film that feels and looks as authentic as can be for a world that doesnt exist   45 out of 5
Jan 3 2022,positive,one of the best movies of 2021 great acting amazing script exciting plot gorgeous  cinematography and spectacular visual effects this movies has it all
Jan 3 2022,neutral,dune is filmed beautifully but is on the slow side in terms of the pacing of the movie all of the action scenes were entertaining but the filler in between felt quite dull
Jan 3 2022,positive,if it reminds you a little of star wars it should the novel dune inspired george lucas intergalactic saga the visuals and sound are awesome director denis villeneuve does an admirable job turning a slow but complex story with many characters into a palatable 155 minute viewing the trade off is of course character development cannon fodder for critics but for entertainment sake i enjoyed dune and look forward to part ii
Jan 3 2022,positive,very wellmade movie stacked cast with many notable names chalamet as paul atredes is truly a star that will cross over to the more casual viewers satisfying start of denis adaptation of dune though it is most definitely incomplete
Jan 3 2022,positive,as adaption dune excels as cultural landmark of the production the filmmakers cast and audience this film breathes life into its every scene and shot the severe flaw at such a daring and extravagant science fantasy epic is the fact that it stops rather abruptly even if that ends up being the right choice it doesnt feel like the best
Jan 3 2022,positive,excellent half of a sci fi movie 
Jan 3 2022,positive,well done and true to the book
Jan 2 2022,neutral,a decent film which followed the source material almost to the letter sometimes to its detriment it takes a while to get going and seems to reach its climax threequarters of the way through which leads it to limp to its true finale after the incredible visual spectacle of a climactic battle the slower one to one combat that ends the film almost feels anticlimactic
Jan 2 2022,negative,this was the slowest most drawn out full of its self movie i have ever seen
Jan 2 2022,negative,visually amazing to watch 15 stars otherwise nothing    game of thrones meets harry potter and star wars     badly edited not fluid at all and takes a few seconds sometimes to understand what is going on no plot surprises and looks like they think they have a money machine in this franchise    anyway worth a watch for the cinematography but dont spend money to watch this
Jan 2 2022,positive,this is really just dune part one  it took two and a half hours to get to a half way point in the narrative when it stopped presumably for part two to pick it up again  too long and too drawn out  the david lynch version somehow managed to get more information into the narrative and conclude the whole thing in more or less the same duration time  the acting was better in the lynch version too  the special effects comparable  this version had one distinct advantage  it did not have the insufferable sting in it
Jan 2 2022,positive,best version of this so far hope the sequels dont take too long
Jan 2 2022,positive,cant wait for episode two
Jan 2 2022,positive,excellent good acting good story lots of action way better than the dune from the 80s i hope part 2 is as good as this one was
Jan 2 2022,positive,absolutely loved this film its beautifully shot and a very compelling and well told story
Jan 1 2022,positive,amazingly well made and a worthy adaptation of the book that fathered the science fantasy genera
Jan 1 2022,positive,a little slow at times but ultimately its for the best to split the book into two films cant wait for more
Jan 1 2022,positive,the best adaptation of the novel so far a true work of art in a very epic scale only cons are the lack of humanity maybe cause of a lot of visible cuts and battle scenes that are more for the spectacle rather than narration
Jan 1 2022,positive,much better than got novels although same political dynamics
Jan 1 2022,negative,too long and with an uninteresting plot although some of the animations and futuristic concepts were interesting and the music was good but overall i regret watching this movie
Jan 1 2022,neutral,im going to copy and paste this review done by a film criticif thats permissible  i could have done something passable but this hit the targetdune part one follows timothée chalamets paul atreides as hes forced to embrace his destiny as the leader of his family and an entire race of people filmmaker villeneuve working from a script written with jon spaihts and eric roth delivers a fairly faithful adaptation that is for the most part visually impressive yet dramatically inert as the movie much like its source material suffers from an armslength feel thats exacerbated and perpetuated by an emphasis on dull onedimensional characters and dialogueheavy sequences transpiring predominantly within dimlylit environs  with the farfromenthralling atmosphere preventing the viewer from working up much interest in or enthusiasm for the protagonists deliberatelypaced exploits its clear consequently that villeneuves largerthanlife approach doesnt fare nearly as well as one mightve hoped or anticipated as the pictures myriad of meticulouslycrafted setpieces are unable generally speaking to pack the exciting visceral punch for which the filmmaker is obviously striving ie the movie is ultimately big on spectacle but frustratingly short on everything else by the time the nigh endless third act rolls around dune part one has cemented its place as a distressing misfire that seems to confirm that frank herberts 1965 novel is just not suitable for bigscreen treatment 
Jan 1 2022,positive,probably the only film i can think of where its actually better to read the book first as it follows it perfectly but simplifies bits
Jan 1 2022,positive,epic best movie of 2021 cant wait for the next one
Jan 1 2022,positive,visually amazing and great world building perfect balance of action and plot development i knew nothing about dune before hand yet i understood it just fine
Dec 31 2021,positive,like star wars without the fun parts
Dec 31 2021,positive,desert power    long agoin a galaxy far far awaybefore star wars mad max tremors and game of thrones there was only dune    a story and world that gave birth to fantasy and scifi as we know it as a main influence and many more for years to come although i havent seen the other adaptions of dune with either of the lynch or tv version so this is my first introduction to the world and characters and something that was once considered unadaptable has become a reality all thanks to denis villeneuve vision and now im interested in this world and the movie leaves you wanting more    dune 2021  man what a trip incredible in every sense just like blade runner 2049 nobody does art house blockbusters better than denis villeneuve a scifi tale of philosophical richness thats loaded with grand spectacle while i didnt see it in imax but that didnt take away from the scope of it all    no joke but this could be our new lord of the rings and star wars    the acting here is strong    timothée chalamet has impressed me ever since his breakout role in call me by your name so its not surprising that he did an excellent job in this movie as the character of paul the young man in royalty whose destiny can lead him in either direction not bad for a kid who started off showing off his xbox controllers on youtube if you dont know what im talking about type into youtube moddedcontroller360 and youll see    oscar isaac plays the duke the father of paul and oscar isaac has yet to deliver a terrible performance theres one scene between him and chalamet that was one of the most moving things ive seen in a scifi movie sincewell arrival and blade runner 2049    rebecca ferguson plays lady jessica atreides who is easily the heart of the movie and it might be my favourite performance from her    jason momoa plays duncan the ultimate chad whos a chill guy but is an absolute demon when it comes to fighting josh brolin as gurney halleck a cool but serious man who loyal to those close to him stellan skarsgård scenes as baron vladimir harkonnen the bloated and slimy creature with a hunger for power and chaos which also pays a wonderful homage to marlon brandos colonel walter e kurtz in apocalypse now through the visuals in every scene hes in also despite the small screen time he had but dave bautista has proved that he has more range as an actor than most wrestlers who turned to acting    zendaya isnt in the movie that much but i know she will be in the next movie her little scenes were very mystical she appears mostly in visions from chalamets paul which people have best described those visions as the most expensive perfume advert ever    in terms of the visual effects and the practical work its a piece of art it helps create a sense of scope that made everything feel so big so real and so engaging to watch i can say all of it looked pitch perfect but also using real locations for open spaces and made certain bits of environment like heat from the actual desert harsh winds soggy rainy grass and the breathtaking landscapes seem familiar to us in this alien world    the score makeup costumes production design cinematography editing sound and direction were all top notches    however the movie does feel like a part 1 and for some people the movie feels incomplete story wise but then again if it leaves you wanting more and we now know we are getting a part 2 to this story this issue will expire when the second one comes around
Dec 31 2021,positive,amazing movie one of the most wonderful ive seen in years
Dec 31 2021,positive,so i got to rewatch dune again this time in a bigger theater not in imax though and honestly i still cant find no flaw it is perfect from start to finish and i was just so focused on the movie it is just phenomenal also in that time between my first viewing and that one ive seen a lot of youtube videos magazines articles interviews and i even listened to the soundtrack an uncountable amount of time and the details ive seen and discover during this viewing were amazing denis is a formidable directorgenius
Dec 31 2021,positive,movie was beautifully shot and acted sound design was incredible you may find that you better understand the movie with subtitles since it has many made up words spending time actually paying attention to the movie would clear up most of the negative comments people have about this movie
Dec 31 2021,positive,showing this magnificent book fron this side is brillant
Dec 31 2021,positive,beautiful   but  i was predisposed to love the movie i even went out to a theatre for the first time in years to see it i wanted to love it  i did not have an issue with the acting although some of the secondary character casting missed the mark for me  there was so much heart and belief and intensity and passion put into the making of the movie but the movie experience felt hollow missed the heart of the story missed something  ive since watched it again two more times on the small screen trying to find what was missing and i cant  visually  its stunning but it just didnt connect   almost like it was trying too hard to be awesome and came up short  and lots of time spent on visuals and special effects meant less time on story and character development  all mouth and no trousers  heartbreaking for all the wrong reasons
Dec 31 2021,positive,blew my expectations out of the water brilliant film cant wait for the next part
Dec 31 2021,negative,this cannot be considered a great film  the characters were poorly established chalamet is not a strong leading character the plot was incomprehensible and the bloated ensemble of characters was a muddled mess  the cinematography and colorizing were amazing however  overall disappointing
Dec 31 2021,positive,awesome dealt with the tough plot lines and very well acted made you want to see the next movie ala lord of the rings
Dec 31 2021,negative,incredible cgi and sfx but it was boring also felt like a big setup for part ii but whats the point if you didnt understand anything up to the end of part i
Dec 31 2021,negative,stick to the original
Dec 31 2021,negative,so boringand i thought the original was bad
Dec 30 2021,positive,director dv continues to build on what will be a legacy of incredible achievement his signature style regarding poignant negative space and grand scale serve dunes themes and settings perfectly well done
Dec 30 2021,negative,disclaimer ive not read the book movie intermittently swings from entertaining to very boring was confused a lot of the time pales in comparison to epic movies with a proper narrative eg lotr interstellar assuming all the great reviews from the sci fi purists or maybe those who got to see it in the cinema
Dec 30 2021,positive,absolutely incredible one of the best movies of the year
Dec 30 2021,positive,very true to the book  was ready for the next sequel as soon as this film ended
Dec 30 2021,positive,star studded cast breathtaking visuals compelling writing its no wonder that were getting a part two
Dec 30 2021,positive,great job on a visually stunning adaptation of dune  a gem in the last 8 years of hollywood mountain of garbage
Dec 30 2021,negative,one of the worst movies ive watched
Dec 30 2021,positive,really good movie nice visuals good acting great audio experience quite true to the book changes are ok  personally id like to see an extended cut soon     it tells you in the beginning that this is the first part but you have to wait a while while youll see the next instalment that was a bad decision fans will wait but the general audience will forget the first movie and they didnt understand why it ended there
Dec 30 2021,positive,finally a dune i can watch without being bored star wars for adults
Dec 30 2021,positive,beautiful visuals and interesting characters make up for the slower pace of the plot  its wonderful to see the novels vision finally realized in film after so many abortive attempts
Dec 30 2021,positive,stunning graphics and the scenery was beautiful but thats about it the entire film felt like a trailer for the second movie  little answered lots of animosity and half the time youre on the verge of falling asleep despite the publicity around zendaya her presence was lackluster its just one of those movies you see to pass the time worth the watch but barely
Dec 30 2021,positive,this movie is a scifi masterpiece that was able to do justice to the books  you wont find any sci fi movie star wars included that can rival the imagery in this movie i wont say more just watch it yourself but also a lot of rotten tomatoes  professional critics should lose their jobs seriously a 15 one said bladerunner 2049 was better i almost died of laughter my god was terrible f reviewers dont listen to those people
Dec 30 2021,positive,great interpretation of the original story sound music and effects are enthralling totally absorbing and looking forward to part 2
Dec 30 2021,positive,absolute masterpiece film of the year for me breathtaking visuals and soundtrack cant wait for part 2
Dec 30 2021,positive,you know a movies good when you spend almost 3 hours watching it and you wish there was more
Dec 30 2021,positive,this is a beautiful looking movie the cinematography is insanely good and the cast is stellar however it might be very confusing if you are not familiar with the story of dune that was my biggest problem
Dec 30 2021,positive,the visuals are stunning and the first half of the film gave me chills once it started straying from source material though it lost its edge
Dec 30 2021,positive,a wellmade modern take on dune that is true to the original novel the ending however is rather abrupt and awkward and doesnt seem like it will be a good transition into part 2
Dec 30 2021,positive,unnecessarily cashcowed a singular epic would have pleased
Dec 30 2021,positive,absolutely fabulous  very true to the original novel and brilliantly captured the scale and grandeur of the dune universe
Dec 29 2021,positive,the best first half of a movie i have watched in 2021 i am looking forward to the next chapter
Dec 29 2021,positive,my dream have finally come true this is the best possible adaptation of the fh dune cant wait to see another part
Dec 29 2021,positive,it was really well done for the first half of the book they left a bunch of stuff out probably for time but overall well done visually stunning cant wait for part 2
Dec 29 2021,positive,as someone who has not read the book its a bit slow going at first by the end i was wishing part 2 had already been released
Dec 29 2021,positive,awesome one of the best dune movies no is the best of them all of course not as good as the books but an excelent start
Dec 29 2021,positive,im going to be honest i dont get the hype around this visually its beautiful the sound and music choices are really good as well all of that deserves praise although the movie has a painfully convoluted and sometimes boring first half only after 1 12 hours did i start to get invested in the story suffice to say it took way too long to become interesting still id go see it
Dec 29 2021,positive,a great experience villenueve brought dune world into the a universe
Dec 29 2021,positive,visually enthralling truly an experience looking extremely forward to part 2
Dec 29 2021,negative,too much too slow i do not find it brings anything new compared to the delaurentis film indeed this film served to understand how good and farsighted delaurentis was cutting out all those useless parts that would have made everything boring
Dec 29 2021,positive,there is so much ground to cover in the dune universe this really should have done as a multi season television series
Dec 29 2021,negative,i was hoping for a new science fiction series but all i got was a boring overlong insult to my intelligence with cheesy special effects mumbled unintelligible dialogue and if there was any plot i could not find it    watching this was two hours plus of my iife wasted
Dec 29 2021,positive,somehow manages a balance between nothing happening and keeping the viewer engaged with the movie it has everything that should bore you to tears long explanations about lore and backstories little to no actual plot progression for at least half the movie its mostly set up etc etc however i spent the entire two and half hours entirely engaged with the plot characters their relationships and what was coming next the world building is brilliant the characters are well crafted and well acted sound design was great the effects and set designs are fantastic seriously how do you make the dessert an interesting environment they manage it somehow and its all around a great movie my only real criticism is the fact that the entire movie is mostly set up and it feels as though once you finally get to what you expected the movie to be about it ends
Dec 29 2021,positive,there is no finer rendition of this wonderful story and heck it even makes a decent film this time might not win many big time awards but this is far better than fanclub pandering we get from marvel or the lotr films this isnt somebody just paying with the characters nor trying to recreate a book verbatim this was myth retelling in its finest honor the heart of the characters and tell a story with the same meaning in doing so dune has been reborn and raking in new fans as its reward will be exciting to see what happens next with this evolution
Dec 29 2021,positive,cant wait to see the next dune movie this was great
Dec 29 2021,positive,good movie  looking forward to the sequel
Dec 29 2021,negative,i enjoyed washing my dishes more i loved watching the original although it is cheesy by todays standard and i wasnt sure if this was a remake of the original or an attempt at a reboot  when i saw who was starring in this version i was looking forward to something better than i watched until i got bored and washed my dishes instead
Dec 28 2021,negative,terrible i wonder  if they used cliff notes to write the script i walked out tried to wait to see a worm but couldnt stand it
Dec 28 2021,positive,for a passionate fan of the book the freedoms undertook by the director were to much for me and the casting was unconvincing
Dec 28 2021,negative,a film for people who would never read dune fair enough
Dec 28 2021,negative,i know the movie was close to the book but way to many dermatic sences with music such a waist of screen time
Dec 28 2021,positive,truly incredible movie
Dec 28 2021,positive,wasnt as good as i expected would of been mad if i paid to watch this on the big screen
Dec 28 2021,positive,beautiful but frustratingly slow and pointless 
Dec 28 2021,positive,epic movie but it stinks that they hint at a sequel but nothing is in the works
Dec 28 2021,positive,honestly i think i missed something maybe in the next dune movie ill undersant the first movie as well but i liked so much the scenes the visual effects and how the actors did they job
Dec 28 2021,positive,i love dune the novels and even the lynch film this version i enjoyed but found slow and somewhat drab visually the story arch left me feeling like id watch half a movie as opposed to a movie setup with a sequel mentats are iconic feature of dune and their near total omission disappointed great acting talents were under used in lieu of long ambiguous vision scenes and dim confusing desert fights david dastmalchian as piters under use was very disappointing not nearly enough vladimir harkonnen the worms cgi is terrible they look more like a surreal dream than anything that could actually exist
Dec 28 2021,positive,dune is a big scifi story of a heros journey to a dangerous planet to ensure the future of his family and his people deserving of a rich treatment and in this regard the 2021 film delivers while the performances are good the most impressive thing is the music and visuals especially around the epic battle scenes although long and slow at times it is worth it for these moments
Dec 27 2021,positive,a worthy adaptation of the book
Dec 27 2021,positive,beautiful space epic wish the next was ready to watch
Dec 27 2021,positive,this movie is awsome when you go seeing this movie your not going to see a fastfurious kind it is slower with a real ambiance the soundtrack is immersive and brings us deeper in the movie the images and all the natural lights in this movie worth the price of the cinema tickets plus the expensive popcorn twice   im impatient to see the part 2   chefsdoeuvre 
Dec 27 2021,negative,very dull the entire movie is set up for the sequel  loud obnoxious music is played over every little thing as if there is some sort of grandeur in ever single space ship person view  action   really kills any gravitas that it might have brought if used appropriately     its biggest flaw is being boring though i dont think i have ever wanted a movie to just finish so i can leave as much as this film
Dec 27 2021,positive,everything about this film was executed perfectly best film i have seen in years
Dec 27 2021,positive,this movie is very immersive with great world building i cant wait for the next installments
Dec 27 2021,positive,this is a true cinematic incredible experience
Dec 27 2021,positive,great movie visually impressive and follows closely the original book
Dec 27 2021,positive,this stuck very close to the book enjoyed it much more than i expected a few scenes felt a bit awkward
Dec 27 2021,positive,a step down from blade runner 2049 and more importantly its source material
Dec 27 2021,negative,if youre looking for a good nap well this is the movie for you i fell asleep all three times i tried to watch this film eventually watching it entirely and i was upset i seen the original and liked some of the changes in this film but i wasnt a huge fan of the original either great idea but dont think this should be a movie there is so much content my opinion is to go the tv series route this story needs many more hours to be told
Dec 27 2021,positive,very drawn out storyline
Dec 27 2021,positive,very entertaining  excellent screenplay and special effects
Dec 27 2021,positive,big fan of frank herbert  slow paced but filmtography pacing story is timeless
Dec 27 2021,positive,literally the best scimovie ive ever seen 1010 acting visuals music and even proper representation of the book impossible to not enjoy if youre a fan of the genre
Dec 27 2021,neutral,great visual effects but boring
Dec 26 2021,positive,this is a great movie that engages and entertains the viewer from the effects to the acting everything drives the storey forward and pulls you in i will be waiting for the sequal and hoping it comes sooner than later
Dec 26 2021,positive,awesome movie great cast stellar acting ready for part two grew up playing the dune games
Dec 26 2021,positive,loved it beautiful vast and powerful scenes a triumph 
Dec 26 2021,positive,only bad thing its part 1
Dec 26 2021,positive,this is the second dis villeneuve movie ive seen since arrival in 2016 and i hated watching that movie i love watching this movie man its just so good the world building is just truly epic in itself but that just barely scratches the surface of what makes this movie so perfect i love scifis like star wars or any of the countless space shows like foundation but this is easily my favorite scifi movie or favorite movie period
Dec 26 2021,positive,to be honest i think denis villeneuve told frank herberts story better than frank herbert theres an early reveal in the book that robs the story of any opportunity to build dramatic tension and gives the duke a bit of a foolish character villeneuve corrects that mistake and the story is so much better for it the acting is incredible best movie of 2021
Dec 26 2021,positive,ok im waiting for the continuation
Dec 26 2021,positive,reminded me of the last jedi movie only i really enjoyed that movie this one was long and drawn out
Dec 26 2021,positive,while the internet hadnt pushed me that much promo for dune i still felt like this was a movie for me and boy was i right i wasnt familiar with the story of dune and never got into the book because a common consensus told me it was a difficult story to follow but the movie proved the exact opposite the way it is shot the accompanying music the cast the cinematography and most importantly the brilliance of director denis villeneuve all brilliantly fall in their right place to create this masterpiece of cinema ive watched it twice in theatres and ordered the book immediately which  by the way  is equally brilliant and deserving of its praise     it will be hard for a movie to replace dune as my new 1 favourite movie and i look forward to see the challengers go watch it and read the books while your at it
Dec 26 2021,positive,i usually trust rotten tomatoes as a solid barometer of what is good and what is not which is why seeing dune with a paltry 83 instead of a solid 95 makes me want to spit my popcorn this movie is outstanding end of no debate nada
Dec 26 2021,positive,one of the best cinematic experiences of the year maybe even this decade
Dec 26 2021,negative,not near as good as the original more added drama for no reason except to try and make another movie out of one movie a horrible job at casting the actors they all need help 
Dec 26 2021,positive,its worth seeing just for the visuals and cgi alone however its also got a great cast great music and some great action all of which helmed by one of the best scifi directors working today the story is a little hard to keep up with and the pacing could use some work but its still worth a watch
Dec 26 2021,positive,i wish i could give this movie a better review but the willful dearabification of herberts work particularly the fremen to cater to the almighty  and prevalent racism ultimately neuters herberts original message and story
Dec 26 2021,positive,oh man this movie is fantastic so close to the book source it is scary glad its been broken into two part to enable a focus on story tellingworld building its such a complex story that it needs the time for absorption the visuals are stunning the effects are amazing the soundtrack fits the narrative fresh as fresh as fresh
Dec 26 2021,positive,best half movie ive seen all year not saying much but  delivers enough exposition to get the first half of the hefty novel coherently delivered doesnt drag sprinkles sufficient effects  action to keep things ticking along admittedly the material is 33 political intrigue 33 indepth sociologyecology backgrounder and 33 action scenes im a longtime dune fan but id like to think the combo works for anyone whether youve read the books or seen lynchs 84 version on the evidence of bladerunner2049  arrival i knew villeneuve would do a detailed  incredible job and he delivered the goods pitch perfect production design  effects solid casting  well except coulda used a more solid paul a bit too thin  broody to deliver believable buttkickings to adultsize foes and gotta say im not a big fan of arbitrarily gender flipping the liet kynes character  definitely looking forward to delivery of the second half in 23
Dec 26 2021,positive,the set and costume design and the score were incredible the cinematography and mood of the film were so perfectly tailored to the themes and story and the context of the film in my opinion it was a close to a perfectly crafted film
Dec 26 2021,positive,itwasokaypity it was only half a storynot as enjoyable as the original david lynch version which although constrained by the technology of the eighties was a much better movie
Dec 25 2021,negative,i didnt feel anything for the characters the movies had cool visuals but the storytelling was confusing and i felt like i didnt get to the plot even when the movie ended it felt like a 25 hour runway that took me nowhere very unsatisfying
Dec 25 2021,positive,the best movie ever epic
Dec 25 2021,positive,beautifully shot even though it only depicts half the book it felt so rushed and lacking the detailed exposition of the book that draws one in and engages a readerviewer with the characters and many factions involved the film is more like viewing an adaptation of a cliff notes summary of the book it lacks heart and depth while much better than the awful lynch directed attempt to bring the book to the screen it still falls short
Dec 25 2021,positive,i cant even right now  just see the film  its exactly whats needed   it was incredible
Dec 25 2021,positive,knew nothing about the dune franchise before dune came out did a little research before watching and i was admittedly worried i would be absolutely lost while watching but i wasnt i didnt feel confused and was fully engaged the whole movie i had to watch again to fully grasp it but i really really liked this film the lore behind it is enough to keep me coming back and wanting more villeneuve is in a league of his own at the moment every single one of his movies are absolute bangerssss
Dec 25 2021,negative,the film had great visuals however i was bored watching it
Dec 25 2021,positive,best movie in years it is on such a higher level than hollywood product that they have a real problem
Dec 25 2021,positive,perfection a must see
Dec 25 2021,positive,decent plot but a bit slow
Dec 25 2021,positive,well this one need some words i never read the books rearely do i did saw lunchs film i remember some visuals but otherwise it left me pretty much clueless and its considered my worst film of his by miles jodorowsky tried to do this film way back it got into years in production and was about to become a 10 hour plus film with rockstars and the wildest effects and props the world had seen i saw the 2013 docu about that film and its know to be the best film never made  now its done its made and it delivered boy did it deliver    the story is huge  the most sold scifi book of all times if i remember correctly that will take some time to put on screen plenty of characters races worlds languages ways and rituals villeneuve presents it perfectly its slow but not too slow you get a grip of it while you slowly enter this amazing world there is no need to go deeply into the plot here but lets just say that there are a few rulers of worlds  some good others bad searching for collaborations or war in the year of 11000 something    it becomes a drama a hunt and a matter of life and death for both races and individuals throw in the most simplistic enormous creatures mixed with gigantic spaceships that can destroy earths in seconds and you are in for a scifi action drama that wil blow your socks off villeneuve was made for this film he earned his right to do the biggest film in newer times as he has such strong films under his belt  i have seen them all except from polytechnique and he always deliver i was wrong i did not want a follow up or two but it will surely be needed i will almost count days for its release    the cast is amazing and so is the eeriesque music the visuals is still the strongest factor here along with the narration when all things are combined this long film is nearly flawless and screams for the big screen    i like to look at this film as the artistic and darker version of the star wars universe i know it will be dragged out into more films and even series i dont like the series idea but yes  im dying for the next film  this is only the beginning    95 out of 10 spices
Dec 25 2021,negative,dune itself could be an incredible saga though was ultimately let down by denis villeneuves lack of ability to tell a story without boring us to death with a showreel of visual composition    dont get me wrong at least villeneuve is great at that but he should not be allowed to direct a movie until he has learnt how to tell a story which are two very different things    brooding atmosphere was his attempt which overall failed as the director tried to sustain more of a long and cheap meditation video attempt though it worked as i fell asleep well that night    in summary visually stunning with a mountain of poor dialogue
Dec 25 2021,positive,fantastic movie a bit confusing but watching it twice really helps timmy kills it everytime 
Dec 25 2021,positive,absolutely engrossing i read the book many years ago not only does this film follow the story of dune but it creates the intensity of feeling and intrigue i experienced from the reading the novel
Dec 25 2021,positive,visually this movie was amazing but the background score was so over the top at times to the point of me cringing like who in post edit was going through this and said yeah that seems good and the constant cutting back and forth to and from chani was just obnoxious im not sure how you can get the visual stuff down so well and then let other critical things slip
Dec 25 2021,positive,groundbreaking in a lot of ways really excited to see how part 2 captures the story
Dec 25 2021,positive,action packed great effects and sound
Dec 24 2021,positive,i cant express in words how epic this movie is
Dec 24 2021,positive,very good movie not at all what i expected based off of the previews as a nonreader of the book but very good nonetheless     it had really great universe building that established an amazing story with beautiful graphics it was slightly confusing at the very beginning which may be my only complaint but in a little while through the story it makes much more sense
Dec 24 2021,positive,the books were so good and deep that its hard to put it in a movie and not get boring  better than the original but slow and boring
Dec 24 2021,positive,this is a must see if you liked the first dune novel its just part of the novel as the second half of the novel will be in the next movie so says warner bros as it stands it is a very very good movie i read the first three books long ago and saw the previous 1984 movie this movie is so much more satisfying to watch even though its only about half of the story  my wife hated the 1984 version by d lynch and she really liked this one a lot more than she thought she would  the pace the unfolding of the story events the acting its all close to perfect imho  i will buy the 4k bluray as its a keeper for sure  well done  update hey bought the 4k bluray and looking forward to another watch of this excellent movie   they really have done the almost impossible here bringing the novel dune to life on screen which many said could never be done properly this is it  oh did you know the movie won the most oscars for 2021    the true winner of the oscars 2022 dune earned six academy awards out of its 10 nominations this film was considered the best by the academy in the following categories best cinematography best visual effects best film editing best production design best sound and best original score
Dec 24 2021,positive,finally someone made a dune movie that is worth watching and approaches the same quality as the book part of the success was not trying to tell the whole story in 25 hours 
Dec 24 2021,positive,one of the most visually stunning films ever tough to adapt from the novel but they did an impressive job just prepare yourself for this only being the first of two parts
Dec 24 2021,positive,must see beautiful storytelling directing and score cinematography at its best
Dec 24 2021,positive,stunning visuals and performances as a fan of the 80s film i am so happy to see an updated version where we get more details and the storycharacters have time to develop cannot wait to see part two well done
Dec 24 2021,positive,i loved the movie  great cinematography excellent casting followed the book  cant wait for part ii
Dec 24 2021,positive,loved and cant wait for the sequels denis villeneuve at his best hope it win the golden globes for director  best movie and then the oscars
Dec 24 2021,positive,denis can do no wrong and this is about as perfect an adaptation as i could imagine  the whole cast is spectacular with momoa skarsgaard and ferguson as the standouts  absolutely love what they did with jamis in this honestly a highlight of the film for me  never been a huge chalamet fan but after this i can say that i am my favourite performance by him  couldve used some more information on the other major factions eg spacing guild but im sure thats coming in part 2  a must see for any scifi or film fan
Dec 24 2021,positive,really good movie engaging good characters and doesnt feel rushed looking forward for the upcomming sequels
Dec 24 2021,negative,wtf was happening and wtf should i care it looks amazing though
Dec 24 2021,positive,after two days wanted to rewatch it again in a movie theater
Dec 24 2021,positive,a bit slow at the beginning but as the story progresses every single scene acquires explicative importance that helps to get fully immersed in this new and quite complicated world also a pleasure to the eye
Dec 24 2021,positive,best movies ive seen in a very very long time nothing made in the last 15years beat this
Dec 24 2021,positive,having never watched or read the original i came into this story blind i have to say i still enjoyed it and look forward to seeing the second film i heard so many reviews about how zendaya had such a minimal part but i feel she was used appropriately throughout the film
Dec 24 2021,positive,dune is a masterful piece of cinematic storytelling its bold dark and multilayered narrative challenges the viewer the directing acting and cinematography are fantastic the cinematic palette and in particular the soundscapes bring this film to life a must see on a big screen in a dark cinema
Dec 24 2021,positive,i loved the original with kyle mclaughlin and this one didnt disappoint other than i didnt realize it is a prequel  i thought the casting was spot on especially the barron  kind of surprised at some of the talent they were able to bring in knowing that their characters wouldnt get a lot of screen time  i havent read the book but imagine that this adaptation is more true to it than its predecessor      the special effects are amazing  the dragonfly like aircraft are impressively original and the rest of the special effects are amazing  well directed acted and written  i cant wait for the next episode who will they cast as fade charlie hunnam or tom hardy sounds like it may be awhile since it hasnt even started production from what i have heard
Dec 24 2021,negative,visually stunning but lacking any sustained suspense or solid character development that makes one really care when things go south
Dec 24 2021,positive,i can not wait for part 2
Dec 24 2021,positive,definitely worth the runtime great soundtrack although sometime its too noisy and great visual and great acting and average script but it become so frustrated when it comes to the last half part of the moviehow can you do something like that   im definitely gonna make a sequel to tell the other half of the story but i want to end it somewhere unexpected and boring is this what denis though when making this film
Dec 23 2021,positive,loved everything from the score and sound design to the costume and set design dv is probably the best scifi director ever
Dec 23 2021,positive,loved this movie a thousand times better than previous attempts and smart to not try and cram the whole book into one movie
Dec 23 2021,positive,a good adaptation of one of my favorite books no sign of fayed rautha or alias yet but seeing where the cut it i understand loved mamos fight scene at the end its worth your time
Dec 23 2021,negative,no context confusing plot nexus too much sloppiness and few action for 230 hours of film take out the main actors the soundtrack and it looks like an indian movie seriously
Dec 23 2021,positive,deducted at least a half star for the genderswamping of dr liet kynes  with a story with many strong female characters this was so unnecessary and ruined the characters death scene and his relationship with his daughter chani    with said excellent work on a story that is so hard to bring to life in a movie format
Dec 23 2021,positive,an epic beautifully shot film brilliantly adapted
Dec 23 2021,positive,movie looks amazing and the acting is quite good but it is an origin story based on a dated novel that was done better on screen with the original star wars trilogy the difference between a new hope and dune is a new hope was an origin story with the heroes triumphing in the end with room to grow this movie has none of that and just does a hard stop to end 
Dec 23 2021,positive,visually and sound wise i can not think of a better representation of herberts book the story is also told in a very decent way my only concern is with some cast the time they have on screen and showing of their character for example why on earth chang liet kynes from man to a woman it makes absolutely no sense and contradicts with the book thufir hawat got literally no screen time and he is a great character but all in all the movie is great
Dec 23 2021,positive,i dont always love movies that are this slow but denis vileneuve does a great job of making the characters and the world extremely captivating the only downside with this movie is that it is a part 1 and it definitely feels like a part 1 thats the only nitpick i have though beautiful cinematography fantastic acting and just an overall great experience
Dec 23 2021,positive,i couldnt love this movie more fantastic
Dec 23 2021,positive,i went into this not sure what to expect  but loved every minute cant wait for part 2
Dec 23 2021,negative,the story took way too long to develop and the overall direction is confusing  i know its a book adaptation but there are a lot of characters and plots that are not developed  i know there are multiple films but it was hard to go through this one without falling asleep
Dec 23 2021,negative,dont waste your time nor your money watching a very dumb movie
Dec 23 2021,positive,it a really well made version obviously the special effect are way better than the 1984 version but is really much more than that the argument is beautifully explain so that you dont have any doubt on what is about the acting was in my humble opinion good all and all i really recommend it
Dec 23 2021,positive,the stunning music and visuals are finely woven into this epic wo being bombastic or pretentious deducted half a star for a few vapid subpar actors ie chalamet mamoa bautista zendaya having said that they were well directed in simple limited rolls they could handle within their limited abilities great writing true to the source material masterfully directed we need more like this
Dec 23 2021,negative,i think i watched a different movie than everyone else this movie was bland boring and entirely too long snooze fest of 2021 
Dec 23 2021,positive,dune has had a few adaptations for both the big and small screen but never at the scale and scope of denis villeneuves its vast even in the early part of the story its telling and that openendedness could play as both exciting for those aware of the lores trajectory and flat for those who arent    this first part or really first act sets the stage for things to come while peppering in just enough excitement intrigue and reveals to keep pacing up it certainly didnt feel like the two and a half hour runtime     on a more granular level cinematography has a wonderful desaturated and earthy feel cold for the most part really only dipping into intense warmth with pauls visions it shouldnt be to surprising really as that work was done by greig fraser  the replicated look of organic lighting and neutral tones flow right out of rogue one and the mandalorian while the bits of heavy saturation we do see can be recognized in the trailers for his upcoming the batman    while its shot beautifully and the large scale moments hit hard i do wish the intimate action had a little more oomph behind it wide shots linger on fastpaced close combat in a way that removes some of the impact portions of the film use extremely closeups to great effect so its strange that fights arent given the same care    my worry for dune is that a fair amount of folks will come out thinking its only a portion of the story which it of course is im speaking more about folks who dont know how grand the story is or that the similarities to star wars are there because it inspired a lot of the biggest themes in star wars the people who know how a film even if its part of a franchise is typically structured especially in the latters case it could feel unresolved and anticlimactic not knowing its part one until the title card reveals itself when tv spots and posters could have been more forthcoming feels like a misstep    dune part one is a tone setter and world builder plenty of events happen but this movie is more about nodding towards whats to come than giving a full arc luckily i am part of the crowd that knows whats to come so for me it worked tremendously well  but mostly all i can think about is if it left folks that are nonethewiser wondering why this first entry felt incomplete
Dec 23 2021,positive,spectacular movie and storyline watching the ones when i was a child were nothing compared to the cinematic delight that is the dune of today
Dec 23 2021,positive,cant wait for more
Dec 23 2021,neutral,i actually need to rewatch this movie again the movie is dragged out way too long fell asleep multiple times however the ending was nice 
Dec 23 2021,positive,go see this great storyline
Dec 23 2021,positive,totally the start of a great series i felt it was well done and changes made from book were well done graphics and audio were amazing 
Dec 23 2021,negative,a rather weak remake with little new content over the previous dune movie while the cinematography is excellent what do you expect after 20 years have passed since the original ooh yes half the movie in twice the time a reflection of the dopey society we now live in
Dec 23 2021,positive,excellent better visual interpretation of the book
Dec 23 2021,neutral,its an slow paced  movie with great storytelling
Dec 23 2021,positive,it is a great movie especially if you are familiar with the book or previous movie adaptation
Dec 22 2021,positive,outstanding performances from the stellar cast in a heartwrenching mindexpanding gorgeous movie in glorious images a dream come true a message from the deep setting us up for a fantastic journey ahead
Dec 22 2021,positive,loved the adaptation too bad wb movies was not willing to commit instead of doing the movies back to back in one production run now there is a risk in small discrepancies in props etc the i hope this will bring a big wave of good scifi im sort of done with the disney super hero factory movie
Dec 22 2021,positive,it definetly feels like a fresh a breath air  an odd one for sure but definetly refreshing i think the challenge of the movie is how are they able to have us connect with characters within one sitting tackling such complex ideas  systems it begs first time viewers to rewatch it
Dec 22 2021,positive,literally the best film of the last 10 years and possibly much longer amazing it got made in the age of superhero movies with faster pacing every gorgeous scene is a piece of art with an otherworldly perfect score fascinating art of the cut interview with editor joe walker on how editing during covid lockdown affected the film brilliant 
Dec 22 2021,positive,visually stunning and brilliant performances that draws you into this world first experience of the dune story and it didnt disappoint
Dec 22 2021,neutral,after blade runner 2049 i was expecting a fantasy epic from villeneuve of lawerence of arabia proportions although once the spectacle aspects of the allstar cast and their red carpet personas fade whats left is a mediocre film with middle of the road performances and lazy action
Dec 22 2021,positive,this movie manages to transfer to the big screen what my imagination was conjuring while i was reading the book denis once again shows he is the master of modern scifi
Dec 22 2021,positive,dune is great but it was essentially just build up for the next movie and ended kind of abruptly
Dec 22 2021,positive,loved the original dune movie the strangeness characters and atheistic but it was pretty incoherent thats what happens when you try to mash huge books into an hour and a half they are trying to do it right this time will probably be a trilogy which is a great idea the baron much less menacing in this reboot however fight scenes were good
Dec 22 2021,positive,love it its a slow build but so worth while you get completely immersed in the story and the only draw back is the movie finished and im left having to wait years for the sequel
Dec 22 2021,positive,a visually spectacular movie ill never forget
Dec 22 2021,negative,a very confusing high budget too long a bit bland movie sorry director you missed it
Dec 22 2021,positive,great actors  best movie ive seen  in years  brilliant 
Dec 21 2021,neutral,i feel that you definitely have to read the book before you watch this movie because i was confused the whole time i fell asleep during the movie in the movie theaters it has a slowww beginning but i liked the ending tho
Dec 21 2021,positive,starts off slow as we get to learn about this new and destructive world that has the human race on its knees as the film moves on its easy to fall in love with these characters and their relationships with each other 
Dec 21 2021,positive,visually stunning  having recently done the audio book and compared it to the movie  it did seem that much of the movie felt rushed trying to get so much in
Dec 21 2021,positive,great adaptation of an incredible scifi book  the casting of timothee chamalet as paul was a brilliant choice  i really enjoyed his work in the king and he is pretty close to what i had imagined when i reread the book  i can hardly wait for the next chapter
Dec 21 2021,positive,fantastic cinematography that lets you appreciate the scenery of this awesome world the actors are well cast and didnt feel thrown together for the sake of a movie they delivered
Dec 21 2021,positive,stayed true to the source material was absolutely wonderful perfect example of when an adaptation to screen is done right
Dec 21 2021,positive,a visual spectacle reminiscent of the wizard of oz apocalypse now and star wars and timeless themes  family legacies lust for power and wealth and the crushing burden of a young man sensing he was preordained to save the universe
Dec 21 2021,positive,authentic rendition of one of the greatest sci fi books ever written cannot wait for the next 2
Dec 21 2021,positive,incredible the best movie i have seen in a long time you can literally tell that this is the original idea dune makes star wars look like space balls hypnotic artful symbolic i am hungry for more
Dec 21 2021,positive,solid action movie decent remake great epic scope of long establishing shots 
Dec 21 2021,positive,faithful adaptation of source material omitting some plot points due to the nature of book to film visually stunning great casting choice
Dec 20 2021,positive,a world building movie which was good but it watched like the best 3 hour trailer ever looking forward to more then to watch as one epic movie
Dec 20 2021,positive,i enjoyed this film im looking forward to the next one
Dec 20 2021,positive,a little too long but amazing cinematography and the score was awesome
Dec 20 2021,positive,well have to see how this movie holds up over time with part 2 but for a part 1 it doesnt get any better than this for a scifi epic
Dec 20 2021,positive,an absolute thrill a great scifi movie adaptation of a great scifi novel cannot wait for part 2 and ive heard he may do dune messiah some point after too it would be a wonderful trilogy if those two novels get brought to life in this same way ive seen this 3 times so far and plan on seeing it a few more honestly i feel it wasnt long enough would love to have seen so many other scenes from the first half of the book brought to life in this style
Dec 20 2021,positive,after living through the rotten tomato that was the 80s adaptation this is what fans have been waiting for all along so glad they made two films to tell the story as it should be
Dec 20 2021,positive,i dont know if its because of the storyline that will be developed in the next movies or the case that i havent read the books but i felt this movie so tedious hope it gets better in future sequels
Dec 20 2021,positive,visually spectacular converts the narrative of the novel to the movie very well watching the movie is fully immersive and is a film to rewatch again and again
Dec 20 2021,positive,great photography it presents us with the motivations and thoughts of the characters
Dec 19 2021,positive,ambitious to a fault and a marvelous technical picture thanks large to the craft that villeneuve has called to construct his personal project most of this film succeds on that purpose even if the screenplay does not gets close enough to the scope of denis vision the acting is very commited to the material and i am very curious for the sequel
Dec 19 2021,negative,unbearably boring and confusing hard pass unless youre familiar with the lore
Dec 19 2021,positive,the next star wars impeccable
Dec 19 2021,positive,this was phenomenal in all honesty i was so utterly engrossed that those 25 hours flew by and i genuinely thought there was another hour to go by the end of it the visuals are stunning the action brilliant and the story immersive the worldbuilding is incredible the music heartpounding
Dec 19 2021,positive,great visuals non gripping story just a trailer for the sequel basically
Dec 19 2021,negative,im so disappointed at dennis villeneuve maybe its not his fault because the problem with this mess of a movie is the plot that is hard to understand at one moment the movie was just a bunch of giant scenes that made no sense to me whatsoever and the characters were so superficial and lacked depth and dimension   everything felt so strange the most overrated movie of 2021
Dec 19 2021,positive,a good movie with a very solid plot that  has some boring scenes but after you saw the whole movie you realise they are needed to make this obviously very complicated but interesting story clear to those who have never read the books
Dec 19 2021,negative,im a dune fan  but this interpretation was ponderous  and it didnt help that my local theater played it with the volume at earsplitting levels for now on im saving my hearing and waiting to watch movies at home  but back to the movie    i get it that dune is a huge book and any movie depiction requires explanation of the complex politics and technology  perhaps it is impossible to make a great movie out of such material  but this version failed to portray the immense drama an majesty of the book nor did it show the heroic journey of the paul atreides in a balanced manor the next movie in the series may rectify that  but that is the point  the movie is incomplete  my advice is wait a few years till you can binge on the full story
Dec 19 2021,positive,works as a setup film
Dec 19 2021,positive,this movie is a spectacular romp for the visual effects and physics for the worms and the characters
Dec 19 2021,positive,this movie is perfect in every way and i am still reading the actual novel holy crap i dont think i will ever see a movie like this in a long time incredibly well done on sets visuals costumes and if you pay enough attention to the plot you will be hooked
Dec 19 2021,positive,nice storyline and good for sci fi novel lovers
Dec 19 2021,positive,really awesome awaiting for a second part of this masterpiece     i have only some doubts related to a few characters changed against the originals eg thufir hawat i cant imagine him as the assassin in the next chapter    good luck for the denis villeneuve
Dec 19 2021,positive,a breathtaking scifi spectacle in the hands of a filmmaking virtuoso it stumbles in the framing held back as a part 1 from having a satisfying plot but im certain part 2 will alleviate our hunger for more
Dec 19 2021,positive,brilliant filmmaking powerful storyline and eyecatching cinematography keeps your attention from the first five minutes through to the end must see
Dec 19 2021,positive,gosh i loved this movie the feel of it the cinematic aspect of it and timothe chalamet did a wonder job playing paul atriedes i was worried after bladerunner 2049 since that sucked so i was very thankful that this was so much better
Dec 19 2021,positive,spectacular will stay with me cinematic masterpiece beautifully shot i cannot wait for the next one literally i started reading the books
Dec 19 2021,positive,watched it with my two children and we all loved it
Dec 19 2021,positive,this is it this is the movie of the year top actors top effects top pacing glad they finally did the book justice
Dec 19 2021,positive,the pacing the plot the music score the scale all of these were sublime
Dec 19 2021,positive,great action and pace  restrained but stunning cgi imagery
Dec 19 2021,positive,a modern classic paul atrides is the new dustin hoffman
Dec 19 2021,positive,even though ive never read the books i thought this was a great movie and absolutely stunning visually it was confusing and hard to follow at times though
Dec 19 2021,positive,slow paced and absolutely stunning visual ecstasy
Dec 18 2021,positive,what dune lacks in action it certainly makes up for it with impeccable cinematography and directing by denis villeneuve the sound design mixed with hans zimmer score makes dune truly something special that needs to be seen on the biggest screen you can find with the best speakers cast standouts are timothèe chalamet and rebecca ferguson who both give incredible performances and are perfectly cast
Dec 18 2021,negative,big set pieces boring action scenes robotic acting and a over dialogued plot equals a collosal expensive waste of time but wait theres a sequel coming the audience must be either blind or paid off by the studios for positive reviews i give honest reviews
Dec 18 2021,positive,awesome in sweep and scope this rendition  brings big screen power and a large budget to properly tell frank herberts series to life
Dec 18 2021,negative,dune is dull and not original i dont understand why people like it
Dec 18 2021,positive,visually stunning with a great soundtrack but its too long and can dwell over the unimportant great adaptation carried by chalamet and ferguson
Dec 18 2021,positive,snooooooooooorefaaaather the sleeper has awakened but alas no i remained asleep early in this adaptation yawn
Dec 18 2021,positive,immersive and truly an amazing spectacle the cinematography is stunning and the score is great however i felt no emotional weight or connection to the characters perhaps those who have read the book may enjoy it more movie was also 30 minutes too long but for me the the stunning visuals alone were worth admission
Dec 18 2021,positive,this is not a passive watching movie where you are checking your social media while watching this or you will miss the entire plot of the story this movie requires you to pay attention and also to watch it a few times to catch everything that being said this movie hit it out of the park in greatness great acting great storyline and way better than the first movie which was rushed and made it mediocre
Dec 18 2021,positive,really good  better at atmosphere than action but still really good surrealism done really well
Dec 18 2021,positive,never believed it was possible to adapt this material but wow did they give it a good shot here watch on the biggest screen possible only wish i didnt have to wait for the sequel but for me this is one of the films of the year
Dec 17 2021,positive,visually beautiful and stunning loved revert character better than the previous screen adaptation by leaps and bounds timothée chalamet rebecca ferguson are fantastic
Dec 17 2021,positive,the movie was amazing one of the best movies of 2021
Dec 17 2021,positive,really liked this so far dont know how i can wait so long for part 2 they followed the bookstoryline pretty good and the key parts were done very well cant wait to see how it all pans out but over a year of patience doh
Dec 17 2021,positive,visually stunning flawless cast impressive adaptation
Dec 17 2021,positive,this mvie is awesome
Dec 17 2021,positive,excellent cinematography i needed to watch something before waiting for the final season of the expanse the plot is well the way its supposed to be so if youre familiar with dune youll enjoy it this is produced by denis villeneuve so you know youre going to be left in excellent hands if you enjoyed his top works namely prisoners sicario arrival and blade runner 2049 then  you should add this to your list this will be the first time dune will receive the justice its deserved for a long time previous efforts to cover the entire series have been futile for once villenueve is ready to tackle this is part 1 and part 2 will be released in two years enjoy the ride
Dec 17 2021,positive,a awesome movie really well done with great effect and a amazing representation of sound music and appearance
Dec 17 2021,positive,this was an awesome film to watch in the cinema as a fan of the book and the 1984 film i thought it was brilliant however you can tell that this is just part one as it says at the start and it is just introducing you to the world of arrakis cant wait for part two
Dec 17 2021,positive,great character and world building the acting was great and i am getting star wars vibes so ready to see dune part 2
Dec 17 2021,positive,a great movie that just falls short of brilliance could have been the best movie of the year but had some pacing issues
Dec 17 2021,neutral,kind of slow felt very bored visually very cool 
Dec 17 2021,positive,enjoyable but heavy minus on the secondary characters and proportionality of reason  action scenes are not fun either  logos fails and worldbuilding regarding characters is shallow    the rest ethos and pathos and aeshtetics are cool
Dec 17 2021,positive,a vast and detailed film that foregrounds scale texture emotionality among a sort of bleak arid desert war in the year 10191 actually some 20000 years in the future but oddly reminiscent of the 1920s and 30s the generation author frank herbert grew up from    movie mixes shakespearean tragic great families fable with villeneuves penchant for dramatic bold contrasts beautiful and uniquely rendered cinematography and good old fashioned action and adventure plot tropes  there are awesome and strange things in this movie and many exotic and bizarre design elements studios need to make movies like this for mainstream cinema more often personally enjoyed seeing a few times at local cinema if you enjoyed the original star wars or lord of the rings series this film has comparible scope wow factor and general audience action and adventure the films constant immersion in exotic costumes and landscapes is quite aweinspiring also director denis villeneuve adds an element of unsettling gothic darkness and unusual worldbuilding to add texture and impact to the work
Dec 17 2021,negative,boring i should like this movie i should like the original movie both are boring i would go for the book but only if its free
Dec 17 2021,positive,if youre into sand and sand not to mention more sand but hell they pulled it off nothing scarier for a film team i would presume to remake a movie based on a planet covered in sand i have been considering for the last 20 years the news media anyway in my opinion it was great it had protagonists and the houses are still something i am personally inspired to write about                                                                                                                                                               spoiler warning  universal space travel relying heavily on the spice mined theron arakis  if thats how you spell it is an excellent plot point for all the action based around the barren sandy planet no other world has spice only arakis great plot harkonan takes the evil guys theme and atradis again spelling are the good guys however the theme based around the first humanoids on arakis is also a great study to partake if i am wrong sorry but 41 stars out of 5 from me 
Dec 17 2021,positive,the new take on this movie is really amazing i really enjoyed it
Dec 17 2021,positive,dragged on for way too long
Dec 17 2021,positive,dune is a captivating scifi spectacle which does incredibly well to draw even viewers like myself who have not had much if any experience with the source material into the world and interest them in its lore the world feels deep lived in and distinct with interesting and wellthought out explanations for some of the problems its inhabitants would face my only real complaint is that at a couple of points throughout the film some of the dialogue was very hard to hear clearly particularly when discussing things early in the film when the audience is still somewhat unfamiliar with the universespecific terminology also to be aware of is that this film is very much a part one and it will almost certainly leave you wanting the second part immediately as it has with me
Dec 17 2021,positive,this movie was beautiful personally it was amazing for me as it ticked all the boxes in the genre that i love the cinematography and the soundtrack was outstanding along with the acting cant wait for the rest of the series to be finished according to the books
Dec 17 2021,positive,visually stunning and filled with wonderful performances particularly chalamet and ferguson i will admit that i had not read the book before watching but i was still left in awe with the grand and epic scale of the worldbuilding and character development and makes me want to pick up the book asap
Dec 17 2021,positive,craving for best visuals and bgm  this movie must be in the list of watching on large screen probably dolby background music from hans zimmer is enough to bring the goosebumps throughout the movie cinematography is top notch with lot of grandeur setting and larger than life sets you will be part of dune from the movie start till end waiting for next part with high expectations dunemovie scifimovies hanszimmer
Dec 16 2021,positive,probably the greatest scifi movie i have ever seen
Dec 16 2021,positive,an incredible attempt to create a book adaption worthy of the writers original style and rhytm this movie combines impressive visual effects with an atmosphere not easy to appreciate with political elements relevant to the purpose of the story and a stunning score made in a style never heard before not a movie for everyone but if you can overcome the superiority of the environment on the characters it will give you a correct representation of what the universe of dune would look like
Dec 16 2021,negative,beautiful but extremely slow paced and oddly devoid of fun dune is all build up with little to no payoff the battle scenes are strangely ineffective failing to cause any thrill or emotional impact as if watched from great distance characters seem to amble around delivering lines but with little emotion or personality other than serious mamoa the only one who livens thing up in his few scenes for a 2h 35min movie far too little happens much of the run time wasted in overextended epic shots and unnecessary slowmo all this to culminate in a rather dull final battle against an irrelevant character introduced less than a minute earlier while solving none of the main plot one is left with the feeling that had the editing been more agile this movie could have easily been 60 minutes shorter or have packed the entire second chapter in its run time
Dec 16 2021,positive,i have watched many many movies and tv shows in my lifetime but i believe dune has to be my number 1 spot for the best movie i have ever seen there is never a dull moment throughout the movie that doesnt make you want to sit at the edge of the chair in excitement and awe in the visual aspects of the levels of detail from the producers of the movie the narrative was spectacular and the story was straightforward to understand coming from me who has never read a page of dune in my life   it is definitely worth the watch on the big screen and the spectacular speakers playing the music that makes your heart go faster or slower during some parts in the movie
Dec 16 2021,positive,exceptional movies and so much better than the original beautiful scenery and characters development
Dec 16 2021,positive,what a fantastic introduction to this universe for new comers
Dec 16 2021,positive,heard an interview between tim chalamet and zendaya  thought it sounded fascinating and the photography was amazing  pleased to see it on the big screen
Dec 16 2021,positive,brilliant adaptation of the book very respectful of the source material when they needed to make changes to translate concepts to screen format i wish the dark tower film had been as faithful an adaptation as this
Dec 16 2021,positive,intense soundtrack and action deep backstory and plot line very beautiful
Dec 16 2021,positive,its visually stunning old school scfi   it set the right tone which is really important for a dune film  the problem is well have to wait quite awhile to see if the ending is as good as the beginning which is why i scored it the way i did   as a stand alone film despite all the positive things i could say it wasnt a satisfying story in itself   personally i dont know why the studio didnt just pay to let him film both parts at the same time  it wouldve saved them money in the long run
Dec 16 2021,positive,a fantastic reboot of the dreadful 80s movie ive never read the book but know enough about it to have a good understanding very well directed and the cast of characters is superb a fun action packed and entertaining movie that is well worth the 25 hours if you enjoy star wars youll enjoy this movie cant wait for part 2
Dec 16 2021,positive,having read the books before going in to watch dune at imax i was worried about whether the movie would be able to capture and portray the immense epic story as arguably one of the greatest scifi stories ever told director denis villeneuve has absolutely nailed it and paid utmost respect to not only the original author frank herbert but more importantly to the readers     the movie is sensational and applies an incredibly honest and faithful adaptation of the story in the book testament to dvs dedication and quest for perfection it had me smiling uncontrollably and nodding along as each of my imagined scenes and mental images id created while reading the books were brought out onto a screen so perfectly     cinematography is a feast for the eyes with every shot capable of being frozen printed and mounted on a wall as art   sound design again incredible hans zimmers score and the sound effects used during action sequences are an audiophiles wet dream     ive come accross a few reviews that said the movie felt unfinished you can tell these people havent read the books which is ok but not if they havent done any research into the story at least this film is clearly titled dune part 1 in the opening sequence and represents only half of the story of book 1 out of 6 does it build a little slowly sure but so does the book thats how you create a legendary masterpiece    whilst unclear how far in the saga this film series will extend to i believe they will tell the primary story of paul atreides only books 12 most likely over another 1 or 2 films and i personally cant wait to see what denis villenueve can magic up next     i strongly urge you to go and see this movie at the theatres just go and watch it scifi fan or not this isnt just a story about space and laser guns its one of the most philosophically beautiful and politically intricate sagas ever told with a splash of action absolutely stunning visuals and a sound design that will blow you away you wont regret it
Dec 16 2021,positive,great movie excited for the next one part ii
Dec 15 2021,positive,not my cup of tea good cast a decent movie experience overall 
Dec 15 2021,negative,hated this film but i never was a fan of dune my girlfriend is she enjoyed it i fell asleep 
Dec 15 2021,positive,a magical  reimage of the classic movie excellent casting acting visual effects that were jaw dropping it will rank as one of the best sci fi movies of all time for me at least  one thing that confused me was about zendaya though her role in the movie  would be lucky of it was 5 mins film time yet she was in all the promos trailers and so on eye candy no doubtim not complaining just saying sex appeal always has and will always sell tickets honestly a water buffalo could just as easily filled her role
Dec 15 2021,positive,a solid redux i enjoyed it
Dec 15 2021,positive,read the books i have to give an applause to the aesthetic design of the set and costumes  very much visualised the dune worldview id say the volume of the sound effects are alright some argues that they are too loud and dune wouldnt be great enough if it wasnt for the sound effects
Dec 15 2021,negative,nothing but successive fight scenes no actual plot just good people versus bad people a terribly boring screenplay i eventually gave up and walked out had been hoping for much more
Dec 15 2021,positive,i should preface this by saying i have not read the source material    well i just watched dune and i have slightly mixed feelings on one hand its a bold concept as well as a visual and sonic epic the scenery combined with hans zimmers score really create the atmosphere i think that denis villeneuve was going for its also competently acted with rebecca ferguson being the standout on the other hand it does very much feel like a set up for another film while thats not entirely a bad thing it does leave the film feeling incomplete and unable to stand on its own its also definitely a slow burner which may leave impatient viewers a little frustrated with this being said its definitely a viewing experience like no other this year and im interested to see what part two will hold i think my lack of source material knowledge may have handicapped my experience slightly but didnt totally derail it im not sure if it was totally worth all the hype and is probably not for everyone but it was definitely unique
Dec 15 2021,positive,regardless its not as good as some his previous films eg blade runner 2049 arrival etc this movie can be considered as a virtue feature based on one of the great sciif novels
Dec 15 2021,neutral,dune is one of my alltime favorite novels so i had high hopes for this film lighting was so dark it was hard to figure out what was happening ive read the books many times or i doubt id have had a clue what was happening much of the time i will go to see it again to try to catch bits i missed i did wish several times i had a fast forward control
Dec 15 2021,positive,marvelous acting directing and production
Dec 15 2021,positive,great scenery and cast spectacular look and feel movie just ok
Dec 15 2021,positive,new favourite film they set the world and tone so perfect only some fight scenes were a bit meh for me cant wait till part 2
Dec 14 2021,positive,one of the best cinematic experiences i have had since avengers endgame 
Dec 14 2021,positive,really satisfying that someone has finally made a movie that does the book justice nicely paced loved the soundtrack and how it contributes to a sense of empire and inevitability ive read the book several times and this helped me understand the imperial politics better  still wish theyd wear the hood and goggles of the still suitsit would make the fremen more real but thats a niggle
Dec 14 2021,positive,epic scale and beutifully filmed dune crafts a rich and exciting world for the audience dreams are messages from the deep
Dec 14 2021,negative,its beyond me what makes this have such a good score i mean the most kind way to describe it is boring it seems streched for a reason it is why make a trilogy if you only have story for one movie
Dec 14 2021,positive,i loved the 1984 film version however this is much better an excellent adaptation of my favourite book of all time a mustsee for any genuine science fiction and dune fans
Dec 14 2021,positive,amazing thats the standard
Dec 14 2021,positive,best movie ive ever seen the music and vfx are so good its a bit complicating but otherwise its perfect finnaly a good adaptation of the book
Dec 14 2021,negative,very disappointed with the 2021 in prep i reread orig book and rewatched the 1984 movie  long version didnt like anything about 2021 casting very poor directoreditor choices very poor  omitted or much worse changed key scenes horrible space travel ships horrible nontreatment of navigators even the worms sucked and the personal shields were a joke compared to 1984 for 25 hours and covering only 12 of book 1 it was an almost total waste of time and  sorry i didnt watch it for free on hbomax when it was 1st released wont go to part 2 very surprising how poorly they misused 20202021 technology and cgi  for year 10191 they could have taken legitimate license and updated tech and esp dials and ornithopter controls from back to the future analog and spinning dials even if herbert didnt anticipate tech changes kind of like star trek original using hair dryers for weapons
Dec 14 2021,neutral,not the best movie of 2021 it was definitely better then the first however if you are not a fan of the books its likely to bore you somewhat  the story is a real slow mover  i do not like how much was left off the cliffhanger and expectation of a second movie that may or may not come
Dec 14 2021,positive,need to know more of its back story wouldve been better to watch this at the cinemas
Dec 14 2021,positive,theres a lot of things that work in this film the cinematography is gorgeous and the soundtrack is phenomonal obviously because hans zimmer duh the main cast is strong and delivers a great performance overall the action is also great with wonderful choreography    however as someone who is not familiar with the original novel i found it extremely hard to follow the story and make sense of some scenes the characters names were hard to remember and i didnt feel anything when a character we were meant to care about died    the dialogue was also hard to hear a lot of the time and would definitely benefit from subtitles as i think a lot of the political scenes with heavy dialogue were the most confusing part to follow    my favourite scene was when paul had to endure excruciating pain while a poisoned needle was held at his neck i got literal chills from that moment    that being said my favourite part of this fictional world were the sandworms the tension every time they were shown onscreen was exhilarating to say the least the sound design of the spaceships was also top notch this film definitely nailed the atmosphere for sure    all in all i would give this film 7510 a solid film but very hard to follow at times which lessened the experience for me
Dec 14 2021,positive,awesome movie the story the soundtrack everything definitely going to see again and cant wait to see what happens next
Dec 13 2021,positive,not a reader of the books but a fan of other fantasy novels this was truly excellent story was thoroughly engaging start to finish and the visuals were fantastic acting was excellent from the entire cast would watch again and looking forward to part 2
Dec 13 2021,negative,villeneuve made the time drag so much with the slow mo and flashes also his serious villainy felt like brando in apocalypse now instead of the grotesque nature lynch portrayed them and the nephew went from a mad max type to a wooden spoon in bautista    give me david lynch studio contempt surrealism and absurd pacing any day
Dec 13 2021,negative,i thought it was slow obscure it helped that i had read the books and the soundtrack was ridiculously loud  i think the soft images didnt help either
Dec 13 2021,negative,pretty boring and very confusing
Dec 13 2021,positive,amazing first part after reading tje book i feel like finally a movie with so much attention to detail does justice to this saga villeneuve truly poured his heart into this his chilhood dream
Dec 13 2021,positive,one of the best movies to come out lately visually stunning and i enjoyed the story all the way through i look forward to a sequel to continue the story if they keep this up i hope they can adapt more of the novels
Dec 13 2021,positive,really good scifi flick
Dec 13 2021,neutral,the cgi and visual effects carried this movie but overall i think the story is confusing and bad i got so bored watching this movie
Dec 13 2021,positive,it was a little long in places and if you dont already know the story it might a hard to follow the cinematography is amazing and really should be seen on the big screen for the best effect
Dec 13 2021,positive,what i liked   great visuals sound and score   pretty faithful to the book   imaginative interpretation of the dune universe   what i didnt like   characters were thin and not developed enough    i didnt love the heroes or hate the villains    the prophecy was really important to the plot but didnt have a high profile   seemed longer than 25 hours  not a good sign
Dec 13 2021,positive,i liked it but if i had not read the book s i think it would have been a little confusing
Dec 13 2021,positive,it was very well done kind of a sad story  the baron was horrid so he did his job well  some of the accents were hard to catch every word and i tried to understand all the different kingdoms
Dec 13 2021,positive,only thing wrong with this movie is that it ended too soon oh and dont get too attached to any of the characters
Dec 13 2021,positive,loved this movie the best visualisation of the story so far the first half of this story was always going to be pretty negative but this surprised me
Dec 13 2021,positive,great adaption great actors i really enjoyed this movie and am excited for more
Dec 13 2021,positive,this is by far the most jaw dropping and amazing scifi movie i have ever seen in my life they did an outstanding job adapting the book to the big screen on this one
Dec 13 2021,positive,lived up to and exceeded the hype  very well made  love the directors vision of this universe
Dec 13 2021,positive,solid adaptation that is a marked improvement over the 80s movie  i favored the early 00s adaptation but will need to see part 2 to fully judge  this is good sci fi
Dec 13 2021,positive,awesome moviemaking great adaptation well paced great acting and lots of action and drama
Dec 13 2021,positive,see again slow plot development psychoanalysis heavy
Dec 13 2021,positive,started out slow but ended up being a good but long movie  not as much action as i normally like but still a good movie i like the fact that they didnt feel the need to include a sex scene to make it interesting
Dec 13 2021,positive,cast is charismatic scenery is riveting story line is gripping and flows well
Dec 12 2021,positive,i was floored by this  and it defied the typical hollywood rollercoaster it takes the material and characters seriously and its slow build makes the ending that much more rewarding not to mention the gravity of this film you can really feel the universe depth of planetary travel cant wait for the next movie
Dec 12 2021,negative,finally saw this yesterday i have watched screen savers with more tension
Dec 12 2021,positive,one word for this movie   epic   truly enjoyed this part one  and hope they make at least 20 more  dune was like star wars on steroids  this movie transported you   there were some things i didnt quite think were so realistic for year 10xxxx   which was the use of stoneage swords  at this time in history there would be no swords except for historical exercise  there would be laser guns which would quickly atomize your opponent or like in star trek would completely atomize the opponent  poof  gone     some unrealistic aspects also are the desert people with hightech suits that conserve water etc   the desert people would not have such high tech apparatus  other than some weaknesses as described the piece was really enjoyable  and it is a joy and a break from disney who seems to be joining in the social programming which america absolutely and vehemently rejects
Dec 12 2021,positive,dune has an amazing story well shot and a great spectacle i love it highly recommend
Dec 12 2021,positive,beautifully and dutifully filmed the only annoying part of this film is that is almost 3 hours long and still ends in the middle of the story
Dec 12 2021,positive,much more fleshed out and serious than the original 1984 film 2021s dune is a great start to a much needed adaptation to the book
Dec 12 2021,negative,really slow and boring no character build up lacked substance
Dec 12 2021,positive,i think this movie is beautiful the history is paused  but you can appreciate the photography it is like that kind of movies that in a future will be considered a movie of cult
Dec 12 2021,positive,the best movie ive seen in several years the photography is amazing good script good acting good pace there were some strange visual effects mistakes some scenes characters makeup and costumes were better in the lynch version the only disappointment was that its only the first part i need the second part right now
Dec 12 2021,positive,loved it this version a dialogue worth following great special effects without taking over the entire motif like most recent scifi films i enjoyed every minute
Dec 12 2021,negative,very very very complicated you have to think a lot i dont like thinking zendaya appears more in the trailer than she does in the film itself 110 or 010
Dec 12 2021,positive,at the end it was just wow
Dec 12 2021,negative,dune was a really sloooooooooooooooooow movie watching paint dry would have been more entertaining the overall plot was bland and lacking originality the action scenes were average and didnt have anything noteworthy to savour the characters were dull and two dimensional it couldnt have hurt to give the super serious characters a pinch of humour to spice things up a bit either the crisp cinematography which was good however this does not redeem the rest of the movie
Dec 12 2021,positive,a beautiful film acting is great effects are great amazing story production design is perfect and the cinematography is the bomb cant wait for the sequel
Dec 12 2021,positive,disappointed the film ends at the highest point of the story not a good closer not at all hope the sequel continue and tell finally a huge part of the story
Dec 12 2021,positive,one of the most anticipated movies of the recent times the reason is that  dune and villeneuve have a huge fan base dune is said to be one of the greatest films film that never made when alejandro jodorowsky tried to make it there is a documentary as well its a worth watch to see how well he was prepared for the movie another attempt was by david lynch which was made into a film in 1984 which is said to be a cult movie even lynch was hugely disappointed by the final product when villeneuve announced the film the whole world of film lovers were eagerly waiting happily he did not disappoint us part 1 is amazing if you involve into the movie it gives a satisfaction and dont let you down    it is planned to be a two parts film and the audience are waiting for the sequel lets wait and see for the conclusion
Dec 12 2021,neutral,engrossing movie for 14 yr old boys    my major complaint is its colour paletterelentlessly beige and brown and black and grey astonishingly dull     its star wars meets game of thrones meets the gospels with rumours of romeo and juliettebut we walked out do not sure about that    sincere banality honestly made
Dec 12 2021,negative,great visual and sound effects one heck of a cast unfortunately too many 2dimensional characters a bit disappointing to be honest nice soundtrack but often it overpowered the dialogue if you cant hear the actors you just have pretty scenery and things going boom id like to see the 2nd part to see if it can be turned around
Dec 12 2021,negative,boring very little happens and that very little is spread out in slow motion for nearly 2 12 hours its mostly atmosphere exposition and filler instead of story literally this movie has no story structure
Dec 12 2021,positive,i liked it quite well but it seemed like it didnt flow real smoothly a little choppy
Dec 12 2021,positive,superb acting  great special effects  excellent explanations dialogue for complex plot  a little slow though needed to be for the explanations
Dec 12 2021,positive,good graphics and acting but more back story is needed if deviating from the book so much
Dec 12 2021,positive,nailed it absolutely nailed it cannot wait for the next one so so fresh
Dec 12 2021,positive,unforgettable in the truest sense of the word  watch for the visuals and stay for the peerless sound design
Dec 12 2021,positive,loved it lots of character building and wonderful photography
Dec 12 2021,positive,stunning visuals and fairly close to the original story contains a sense of epic storytelling and provides a slow but rewarding experience
Dec 12 2021,positive,story characters actors and special effects were all amazing
Dec 12 2021,positive,finally saw dune in imax like villeneuve intended  dune part i is the adaptation of the first half of the novel written by frank hebbert dune  i am going to be completely honest and say that i probably only got 75 of what happened in the movie but dear god was it incredible    denis villeneuve strikes back dune is full of power and energy and even in the silent scenes it taunts us with its energy    the world building here is remarkable and the landscapes the cities the futurist helicopters the worms all the engines and equipment the shields are all astounding one of the best works in world creation that ive seen in movie the visual effects are terrific and im still shocked by the fact that marvels black widow had an higher budget than dune    the cinematography by greig fraser is phenomenal brutal epic and immersive i havent seen a movie that looked this good in the theathers for some time i gotta say    dunes action scenes were the cherry on top fantastic fight sequences filled with well cordinated moves that make you stick to your chair    thimotheé was fantastic and might i say the second best role of his career just after call me by your name rebecca ferguson and oscar isaac performaces were very strong as pauls parents jason mamoa was surprisingly wholesome i love that dude    han zimmer did a great job once again not a soundtrack that we can listen on a daily like interstellars but one that functions incredibly well in every moment of suspence and every moment of madness    production design art direction editing just everything really was top notch i see dune as a serious contender for almost every single academy award this year    dune is a movie that you are almost obligated to see on the big screen it is filled with elements that are enhanced by a theater experience  i will definitely rewatch this some time later maybe after finishing the novel maybe ill think different of dune after that but for now definitely my favorite movie of the year
Dec 12 2021,positive,i greatly enjoyed this movie cinematography is great acting is good characters are good i never watched the original or knew about the story before going into this
Dec 12 2021,positive,dune is a cinematic marvel and the scale of it makes it a bold achievement the beautiful cinematography is so mesmerizing it makes up for the lack of character development  im not gonna say it fail but i didnt quite made us empathize with the characters and fully hook us on the storyline
Dec 11 2021,positive,loved it great casting and wonderful special effects
Dec 11 2021,negative,the only merit of the latest version of dune is that it is visually very well done but the narrative is slow and dull disappointing although with much less means and visual technology lynchs version has much more emotional impact this dune is a colossal missed opportunity
Dec 11 2021,positive,best scifi in a long time
Dec 11 2021,positive,superb rendition of a classic science fiction story
Dec 11 2021,positive,absolutely loved it  cannot wait for the next episode
Dec 11 2021,positive,well acted fun imagery
Dec 11 2021,positive,its a shame this all doesnt fit into one movie but he is basically making the book and doing it right they could not have picked anyone better to make this one of my fav directors denis v  looks amazing the wait for the followupsgonna be brutal
Dec 11 2021,positive,i thought it was a great movie with great visuals and nice for me quite faithful to the book     the one thing it missed i thought was the most interesting part of the book dune the whole concept of how an organization like the bene gesserit tries to maintain its force or its goals over eons of time the idea that you might have to wait hundreds of years for conditions to be right to act while during that time maintaining your capabilities and human resources at peak efficiency and that you need to adopt strategies that take many hundreds of years to develop the most interesting dilemma the book continually poses is when you have to be bold or innovative in taking action even though by definition being bold means you are taking a risk of failure that could mean the end of everything you have tried to achieve of course it helps if you can foresee the future     this all seems very relevant in our world today for instance in our political arena where the forces for truth need to defeat the tendency towards selfserving and lies or in planetary conservation that depends on creating a sustainable economy versus an extractive economy    the most humbling aspect of this that i think the book addressed is to realize that the stakes are enormous but the way is difficult the only reallife successful example i can think of is what nature has invented to do to perpetuate the species and ecosystems for the first it had to invent something called the sex drive with its multiple components in each species that are designed to be reinforcing and unbelievably powerful for the second nature has created an exquisitely integrated cyclical system that achieves 100 recycling and continually renewed productivity its daunting to understand that we need to create something equally powerful as a force for truth or for environmental conservation
Dec 11 2021,positive,such a great movie the cast was on point and the story held true enough to the book  for me to enjoy it fully
Dec 11 2021,positive,the scale and magnitude of it all is incomparable this the desert film lawrence of arabia never was
Dec 11 2021,positive,epic the perfect film  makes you think beautiful amazing talent and performances hope they make all books seen it twice and would go again
Dec 11 2021,positive,very good movie i was surprised i didnt expect something like this the movie doesnt end we need to wait for the next ones    filme muito bom me surpreendi não esperava algo assim o filme não termina precisamos esperar os próximos
Dec 11 2021,positive,the visuals were stunning the scope and ambition of the storytelling was admirable and the ensemble was strong timothee chalamet and rebecca ferguson were the obvious standouts with strong moments from oscar isaac too zendaya jason momoa and javier bardem were essentially in scenestealing cameo mode
Dec 11 2021,positive,a transportive and transcendent experience everything about this movie from the music to the sound design cinematography set design costumes everythjng is crafted to immerse you in the otherworldly quality of this movie you truly feel the spice blowing in the air  while not available forever in this format this movie needs to be experienced in imax
Dec 11 2021,positive,too slow of a pace but i love the story
Dec 11 2021,positive,i honestly feel bad for people who dont like dune granted i understand the frustration with it only being half a movie otherwise this movie rocks in a refreshingly unique way i didnt expect to love this as much as i did but the enthusiasm of dunes creators shines through and its infectious havent felt big hollywood movie magic like this in a long time
Dec 11 2021,positive,amazing movie i didnt read the books or know  much about it but i love scifi the story line is great and the visual and music is wicked good it sucked me in instantly and i wanted it to keep going i cant believe i have to wait two years 
Dec 11 2021,positive,incredible sound and visuals fantastic storyline that stays true to the original source material very well cast and the acting was spot on
Dec 10 2021,positive,amazing movie  amazing landscapes impresive special effects great caracters vivid colors and very interesting movie script  no ridiculous scenes or unfunny white humor or nasty burps  you must see it  i will love to see the part 2 of this film
Dec 10 2021,positive,incredible experience
Dec 10 2021,negative,  this is the biggest load of rubbish i have had the misfortune to watch the acting was pathetic the special effects even worse and the storyline  dont get me started on this you have been warned
Dec 10 2021,positive,i was disappointed with dune although i admire the directors ambition the scenery was unconvincing and the special effects amateurish perhaps it was watching it at home on a 60 plasma screen rather than in a theater but it just didnt measure up
Dec 10 2021,positive,a mustsee for anyone who is a scifi fan and especially those who love the books the movie graphically is beautiful and the story is a very close adaptation of the texts only downside is that it was not advertised as part 1 of a series cant wait for part 2
Dec 10 2021,positive,yes yes yes the story catches your attention once the puzzle is composed but we need to say it it takes a bit even if youre not a scififantasy fan the movie itself is poured with little clever details about this particular world that is describing we leave the cinema by force as wed rather spend our remaining time watching the second chapter see you next year
Dec 10 2021,positive,villeneuve successfully translates beloved impossible to film novel successfully to the screen the movie captures the sprawling feel of a galactic empire and brings the political drama engagingly to the forefront     book fans should enjoy the obvious reverence the crew has for the source material taking artistic license where appropriate for the medium    each member of the cast seems well suited to his part josh brolin and jason momoa  play such interesting characters that you wish they had their own spinoff movies alas the book is no help there    the movie looks beautiful the director pioneered several lighting and volume techniques and the effort pays off as we feel the characters are on a dry windswept desert planet bravo
Dec 10 2021,positive,bruh i gave this film a 2 star review after racing to the cinema to see it upon release ive watched it now probably 3 or 4 times since then and can honestly say its my favourite film
Dec 10 2021,positive,  as a fan of the book i can say that they did a good job the film is a visual masterpiece and as a florida resident i felt right at hone on arrays he film is missing all the internal monolauge and narration of the book but the actors do an excellent job of portraying  the charactors throughts and emotion my only complaint is that timothée chalamet looks like a scarecrow wrapped and a human colored plastic bag but his acting was top notch so didnt bother me that much its a great adaptation i highly reccomend for scifi fans
Dec 10 2021,positive,dune is incredible the story is amazing but the visuals are probably the best ive ever seen it is the first movie in a long time that is deffinitely a mustsee in the theaters on the biggest screen possible the whole cast is amazing but rebecca ferguson and stellan skarsgard stand out the most
Dec 10 2021,positive,absolutely remarkable  i liked the 1984 movie  thought it was quite good  but this  breathtaking youd be an absolute idiot to call yourself a scifi fan and not go and see this  spectacular  cant wait for the next one and will certainly see this one again
Dec 10 2021,positive,dune had incredibly performed a great story to audiences even though it has slightly struggled with a boredome from some parts but overall such as action scene the cast and honorable mention virsual effect are all have make dune top the first as the best films of 2021 it well deserved
Dec 10 2021,positive,met my expectations lots of action emotional
Dec 10 2021,positive,i actually thought the story was pretty good throughout the whole movie and the visuals were so nice
Dec 10 2021,positive,this movie was definitely way better than i thought it was going to be there never seemed to be a dull moment in the movie as i had expected there to be one movie where i can say it was almost as good as the book
Dec 10 2021,positive,i disagree that the movies focus was always on the characters and i dont understand why having a focus on the characters is even bad in the first place the film is the first of the planned trilogy and did a excellent job of setting the ground for the dune universe there is a great balance between action and character development along with outstanding cinematography although the movie ended right before the main characters embarked on their journey it foreshadows what we should expect for the next two dune movies
Dec 10 2021,positive,i liked the moive but it was dragged out
Dec 10 2021,positive,the best adaptation of the book yet
Dec 9 2021,positive,this movie blew me away visually stunning great score and the story line keeps you glued to the screen even if it is a bit slow at times scifi movies can be brilliant or garbage just as easily but this one definitely lands on the side of brilliance nearly a perfect score 455 stars cant wait for the next one
Dec 9 2021,positive,i can watch it again
Dec 9 2021,negative,it was a 3 hr screen saver
Dec 9 2021,positive,this is the best adaptation of dune ever beats 1984 beats the syfy miniseries it is true to the book its is a must see
Dec 9 2021,positive,ive decided to watch the movie again after finishing the book and the only thing i can say is holy fuck    this is cinema
Dec 9 2021,negative,i did not care for this movie  too much special effects and weak story  good actors placed in an overwhelming futuristic time that was not very interesting or engaging
Dec 9 2021,positive,i loved it saw it with my partner last night and it just made me break out in chills again and again to any lovers of sci fi even if not absolutely go and see it the music alone is amazing
Dec 9 2021,positive,great show  casting is awesome with a thrilling plot
Dec 9 2021,positive,i loved this adaptation and enjoyed the level of detail  when i first started seeing all of the big name stars i felt like this was going to end up being nothing but another showcase of one liners  i enjoyed being incorrect  i like how they went deeper into the lore while still weaving in their own nuances
Dec 9 2021,positive,i have never felt the need to write a review before but after seeing dune i know that i witnessed the start of a new ip in par with star wars or lord of the rings i had always heard that the books are regarded as the greatest scifi novel ever written and get the movie still blew my expectations out of the water this movie has everything and then some my new favorite
Dec 9 2021,positive,id watch part two i guess
Dec 9 2021,positive,after a long long long wait dune part 1 has finally hit our screens and the wait has been worth every minute    the books written by frank herbert back in the 60s are considered by many to be one if not the greatest scifi epics ever written i havent read the books but this version of dune there have been others has ignited an interest for me to read the books some time    dune is visually stunning with cinematography that is cosmic in its view that moves down to intimate portrayals of faces and people the action sequences are intense contrasted with moments of quiet reflection    its a long movie but the pacing is so good it doesnt feel long and i felt totally engaged for the whole story the actors are well cast and are believable as is the world that has been created for them to live in characters are skilfully developed the soundtrack is superb    dune is an aweinspiring movie and it must be seen on the biggest screen you can find bring on chapter 2 which should arrive around october 2023
Dec 9 2021,positive,from the plot point of view wei shens narrative continues blade runner 2049 and coming as always not because of the slow pace told to the public but because of the fast life our aesthetic becomes more and more impatient and the narrative rhythm of dune is just right in short it is a revenge of the prince however wei shen shows a grand world view through characterization and lens language and makes extensive use of it not only through some details such as the red of the sword cut to the shield the audience can better understand why the cold weapon is used to fight in the distant future but also the heros shaping is very stereoscopic at the beginning of confusion the battle with jamie completed the transformation and freeman people accepted his plot changes and the gods talked and talked not only that but what shocked me most was the appearance of the first sand worm when the sand worm slowly devours the spice truck from the sand dune the male host and his party overlook the picture of the sand worm which makes me personally immersed although many directors of the ip adaptation film of dune novel have overturned the combination of wei shen and dune is undoubtedly the most suitable hans zimmers score also uses a lot of voices to express the vast and mysterious sand dune scene especially when the sorority is coming there is a feeling of miracle cool colors used this is undoubtedly the best interpretation for the future the dune land where freeman people live in this cold era of political turmoil perhaps only human nature is the sharpest blade i have to say that this movie is made for the big screen and i am looking forward to the second one
Dec 9 2021,positive,dune is a visually thrilling immense spectacular film that demands to be seen on the biggest screen possible director denis villeneuve is a master of making the spectacular personal and he has succeeded greatly here with equal focus on both action and character based on the frank herbert novel this is a film about conquest and honour in a universe far far away the story is very complex but i was struck by how i was never too confused by worlds i knew nothing about house atreides controls the planet caladan and they have been assigned by the emperor to rule the planet arrakis arrakis is a desert planet that has the extremely valuable resource of spice which is crucial to the running of the empire but they are set up for a fall after they land the film focuses on the honour of the atreides family and also the myriad aspects of capitalism and colonialism yes even in different universes these are the factors that oil the machine men fighting for territory at the expense of the people that inhabit these worlds there are many great features to this film but special mention should go to another robust score by hans zimmer and also monumental cinematography by greig fraser a talented and diverse cast ads extra with timothee chalamet and oscar isaac standouts this is a magnificent achievement in world building making for a wondrous film but one that never sacrifices the large for the small and best news of all this is just part one part two will be with us in two years time
Dec 8 2021,positive,the whole movie was badass will be going to see part2
Dec 8 2021,positive,the only thing holding this movie back is its structure because it covers only the first half of the first dune book you feel left hanging when the credits start rolling aside from that dune delivers on all fronts creating a fantastically immersing world
Dec 8 2021,negative,having been a long time frank herbert  dune fan  this frenchwoke version of  dune  was disappointing to me and my contemporaries i just do not think that this  production was up to the task of presenting herberts work  i think that spielberg  could have pulled it off had he been interested you just have to   read   the books
Dec 8 2021,positive,massive editing flaws and cinematography designed for a duran duran video damage what is otherwise an interesting take on herberts dune
Dec 8 2021,positive,amazing story telling at next level theres a maturity to the film that transcends the usual sciif action  which unfortunately is the formula that a lot of people are used to  i would go again just to submerge in the otherworldly visions and score in a cinema environment   did i mention the top cast
Dec 8 2021,positive,epic stunning and thoughtful
Dec 8 2021,positive,went to see dune with my family of 5 we all have quite different taste in movies but everyone really enjoyed this epic adventure not looking forward to the wait for part 2 though
Dec 8 2021,positive,perfectly executed adaptation by villeneuve that will have you excited for the part two finale
Dec 8 2021,negative,i loved the 1984 dune movie and this had a big standard to live up to but unfortunately it failed to do it     the cinematography  special effects were superb but it was way too long 2  a half hours thereabouts the character development was overblown which became tedious by the end     herberts book was fast moving but this screen play was slow  tedious     it was good to see but dont expect it to be better than the original movie for people like me who have hearing issues dont bother because the ridiculously load music makes hearing the actors speech impossible to hear so if youre hearing impaired wait for a subtitles version
Dec 8 2021,positive,beautiful soundtrack and the cinematography is amazing i have not read the books and did not know the plot going in but the movie was very easy to follow
Dec 8 2021,positive,very good we need to see the next one
Dec 8 2021,positive,i loved this dune  i really appreciated the more thorough scenes providing detailed introduction for the characters  i liked the original dune movie having watched it probably 10 times over the years and i liked how this was similar in many ways  but was way more thorough and visually soo much better  the background settings and sound affects were impressive and created a great vibe  im really excited and slightly impatient for part 2 to come out
Dec 8 2021,positive,well done visually beautiful left wanting more
Dec 8 2021,positive,never seen the original but this reboot is amazing the world building is out standing and makes you want to see more if you like big budget big story big universe movies then this is perfect for you
Dec 7 2021,positive,visually this moving was a masterpiece  storywisei have to be honest i fell asleep for about 10 minutes in the middle because its pacing is soooo slow  and i love dune    ill defiinitely be watching the sequel but my expectations are lowered
Dec 7 2021,positive,the movie deserves 4 stars just for the brutalist architecture that villeneuve brings to cinema
Dec 7 2021,positive,truly one of the most aweinspiring and magnificent films ive ever seen  masterful set design costume design ship design weapon design tight script well paced for its runtime amazing performances incredible makeup brilliant cg awesome cast gorgeous score incredible attention to detail every line delivery was fantastic the direction editing and overall production was perfect one of the rare films that i genuinely could not complain about a single thing in it felt perfect theres nothing i would change    unfortunately i dont think this movie will ever really get the full recognition and box office reception it deserves due to lockdowns economic downturn and the changing filmgoing landscape but dune deserves the world  ive heard divisive takes from other filmgoers who either thought it was the greatest movie theyve ever seen or hated it because they got bored and fell asleep in the first 30 minutes i fall in the former category ill accept that those of a different mind might find the first half hour not gripping enough those easily bored might not enjoy it but definitely any nerdy fan of scifi fantasy mythology or grand epic stories should come away from this film very happy my hats off to the director and everyone involved in my opinion it was perfect if i could rate 65 i would
Dec 7 2021,positive,i was unimpressed with the inclusion of gen z type conversation  i would argue that gen z viewers would not have been upset or felt disincluded had the writer not awkwardly forced this in      changing paul and jessica from how they are in dune to being easily unsettled fragile vulnerable emotional characters that were arguably childlike was again to me a nod to gen z to make the characters more relatable at the expense of the book version  changing the story to have chani be more of a focus to me was purposeless did not improve the movie  her contempt of paul to me suggests this was again a shift to appease gen z more than anything  nothing against gen z i just dont think the movie was improved at all by shifting it to pander imo    overall disappointed not going to bother with part ii which i hear is being reimagined to lessen pauls role and greatly increase chanis and its a shame to me  i have been a huge dune book fan for a long time now  the movie could have been great  instead it was just good suffering due to what i perceive as a weird forced pandering to a younger audience  weird in that i think the same young audience would have more enjoyed it more without the forced pandering
Dec 7 2021,positive,if you dont like this movie please jump off a bridge 
Dec 7 2021,positive,this film will win an oscar for best picture it will probably also get director actor maybe actress maybe supporting zendaya who knew a graceful almost disdainful utterly confident chani screenplay costumes music and cinematography movie of the year imho may the gods of cinema grant it the box office to justify part ii and part iii    intelligent story with faithfulness to novel inspired casting magnificent cinematography generally sometimes not great cgi terrific sound track excellent unhurried pacing and just the right length a welcome cerebral relief from the spacewesterns of star wars and the spaceoperas of star trek mature sf as opposed to scifi stow any overwoke criticism of whitesaviorswoopsintorallybrownsavages trope its written into the novel and is inescapable its also circumstantial and peripheral not thematic or central    i had my doubts about the casting of the translucent waif timothe chalamet as the future muaddib a dominant authoritative figure possessed of gravitas and command presence but villeneuve is growing the sapling into an oak this alone should win both of them oscars
Dec 7 2021,positive,epic must see in imax one of the best world building that felt like when i read the book
Dec 7 2021,negative,this is an awesome story and it should be an awesome movie but it is told with a sledgehammer and ruined i originally thought the cinemas sound system was stuffed but its actually the composers fault  also the desert light is wrong there is no heat haze like a mirage and it appears that nobody involved in ornithopter scenes has ever flown an aircraft low over hot ground  the 1984 movie was better
Dec 7 2021,positive,soooo awesome  love all the outfits it makes me want to read the books
Dec 7 2021,negative,great cinematography  dumb story and wooden acting
Dec 7 2021,positive,beautifully shot great adaptation from the books a few moments where the film felt pretentious but it was not overbearing in its approach 
Dec 7 2021,positive,visually astonishing great storyline with remarkable performance from all of the cast
Dec 7 2021,positive,simply breath taking watching this film in the cinema is a must probably the beat piece i have seen this year cant wait for part 2
Dec 7 2021,positive,really enjoyed  finally a perfect adaptation of the novel
Dec 7 2021,positive,overall a great movie very nicely done cant really connect to the main character paul though he kind of reminds me of frodo
Dec 7 2021,positive,incredible   the best book becomes an even better movie  i think theyve done the impossible and improved on the book amazing
Dec 7 2021,positive,an alien galaxy new worlds factions competing for favour and resource no cheesy pop culture elements or tired casting
Dec 7 2021,positive,very long movie with a rich but long backstory the backstory can be overwhelming at times but i can see how this movie would be necessary for future iterations the amount of detail shown was a breath of fresh air but perhaps more time should have been taken explaining the universe in a bit more detail so that audiences that have never read the novels would be eased into all the information a bit better and with more context overall it was a very emotion driven and deep movie which i would suggest to anyone teenageradult
Dec 7 2021,positive,i am not a scifi enthusiast and i have to say that i was blown away the scenery the music and  the acting was overwhelmingly well done the concept itself was revolutionary  i am now going to watch the original movies from 84 i cant wait for the second one coming out next year
Dec 7 2021,positive,unreal do not watch at home go watch at a movie theater
Dec 7 2021,positive,sensational movie amazing thankyou
Dec 7 2021,positive,the movie was enjoyable coloful eye catching views of the desert sands and rocks   however there were parts that were unintelligible because the background music snd special effects drowned it out i had to wear earplugs because the sound was too terribly loud even still i put my hands over my ears to protect my hearing
Dec 6 2021,positive,the thinking manwomans star wars is here
Dec 6 2021,neutral,villanueves dune is a literal and mostly faithful adaptation of the novel to a fault and yet it feels oddly devoid what made it strange and interesting missing are the chapter forwards and sometimes narration of princess irulan an element that provided some of the novels best prose and greatest mysteries that being removed and replaced with a run of the mill zendaya as chani dream sequence on repeat this version of dune simply isnt weird enough and in some ways exists as the antithesis to david lynchs unfortunate 80s flop villanueve instead relies heavily on dull characters dry delivery and dialogue poorly developed intrigue and the same lengthy actionescape sequences that bog down the novel while the visuals are something to behold the film otherwise seems to have very little to say maybe villanueve has something more up his sleeve for the sequel which this film does little to suggest it just feels like such a missed opportunity to do something truly special
Dec 6 2021,positive,the cinematography and color of the film is amazing  but  denis villeneuve has a talent for stretching 30 minutes of story into almost a 3 hour film  his editing beats drag on and force feed the audience  we get it  you spent a lot of money on every beautiful shot  i struggled to stay away for the last 90 minutes of the movie  i gauge how good a film is by either wanting to see it again or purchasing the bluray  i felt neither for this movie but its worth watching oncei guess
Dec 6 2021,positive,good acting by the leads  has potential
Dec 6 2021,positive,visually breathtaking and a great movie to see on the big screen felt a lot like a setup movie for the rest of the franchise i left really excited for the potential of the next one so if that was the goal they accomplished it for me 
Dec 6 2021,positive,stunning picture and noticeable directors attention to details but i think that the movie lacks the entertaining side of the book things are taken too seriously
Dec 6 2021,positive,dune fans will like it for the most part everyone will be blown away must see in imax
Dec 6 2021,negative,had high hopes based on the trailers and cast was a big fan of lynchs interpretation of the dune series being over the top and constrictedly restrained at the same time this film felt like it wasnt sure what it wanted to be so any opportunity to push into new territory was missed too safe and a bit preachy for my taste ymmv
Dec 6 2021,positive,a reasonable adaptation of the book the pace was a little slow however it was clearly setting up the next movies some good performances and worth a viewing
Dec 6 2021,positive,i loved it but i read the first four books i have a feeling you would be lost without some background information this is an in theater third row recline chair movie get a hazmat suit if that makes you feel more comfortable i wore two masks and ski googles
Dec 6 2021,positive,actor selection  excellent  acting  excellent  plot development  very good  visually stunning  it could have been two hours longer and i would have not been disappointed  i read the book 45 years ago and still remember the plot line  but the screen adaptation and scene creation really bring it to life
Dec 6 2021,positive,fun acting great sticking to original story
Dec 6 2021,positive,cant wait for the 2nd part
Dec 6 2021,positive,visually stunning and made me want more
Dec 6 2021,positive,we loved it one of us had read the books the other hadnt but both of us could follow the plot and thats high praise when youre dealing with dune  we were enthralled from beginning to end and it was almost three hours long with the cinema ads at the start of the session  go and see it
Dec 6 2021,positive,well written and acted
Dec 6 2021,positive,the graphics were great the kid who plays paul atreides looks a little too young and fragile also the girl that plays chani is a little annoying i wish they would have showed a little more of atreides planet stellan skarsgard was awesome
Dec 6 2021,negative,what i hated the most about this movie is its only part 1 which they dont tell you that until the start of the movie the trailers and title do not say that    secondly the movie sound  bass is so loud you cannot hear or understand what they are saying 60 of the time    the first half is mostly talking and lots of boring parts in the original movie all the real action happen in the second half so part 2
Dec 6 2021,positive,absolute masterpiece i couldnt call myself die hard reader of the books i have only read dune and only once it is a credit denis villeneuve his vision manages to captures the books in a way i cant always imagine my mind is a little to poisoned by previous dune movies and other science fiction     a huge credit for being able to with ease explain some of the lore politics organisations and rules of the dune universe without tired exposition the movie is sharp and some scenes feel so close to the book its jaw dropping     also a special note on the sound  music of the film its unique ive never heard a film like this amazing
Dec 6 2021,positive,loved it  it was amazeballs 
Dec 6 2021,positive,a genuine triumph by villeneuve the acting is excellent and some performances exceptional excellent directing editing special effects even the cinematography which at times is almost kurosawan great score by zimmer even if many find it boring nein  there is a rationale to its subtlety first third is astonishing some scenes are brilliant loses some steam in the last half hour as the film takes a breath and prepares for the second installment a much more complex and nuanced take on paul atreides interesting too what villeneuve decides to leave out as extraneous 
Dec 6 2021,positive,stunning experience
Dec 6 2021,positive,mind blowingly good an actual true telling of the core material from the book denis made this movie for the fans and no one else if youve not read the book youll likely feel overwhelmed thats fine though be overwhelmed
Dec 5 2021,positive,excellent cinematography cgi effects and plot line music also very well done
Dec 5 2021,positive,fantastic sf  i read some of the books back in the day but gave up on them  just not a suitable read for a bustrain commute  so glad to see some classics coming to the screen
Dec 5 2021,positive,beauriful movie great adaptation of the book
Dec 5 2021,negative,i want to love the movie and there is a lot to love however as a dune fan the fact it was only part one of the movie and they made no plans for part two until after the release was a massive disappointment    do yourself a favor and wait for the second part and then watch them back to back
Dec 5 2021,positive,went into this film totally new to the dune ip i was blown away by the scale the all star cast and the excellent pacing fantastic film and i cant wait for the sequel    quick summary of the film imagine a mash up between lawrence of arabia meets star wars
Dec 5 2021,negative,director is as shallow as a kardashian an insult to the original casting was lacking and a huge mistake leo would have been better with a different lead actor who seemed like a real hero the movie was a major miss i rented for too mcuh and stopped half way through from boredom and disappointment how is it possible a movie made 30 years ago has better effects plot and actors than today i am sick of seeing pro wrestlers and athletes trying to act i am done watching movies fuck hollywood  it so bad  what happened to talent 
Dec 5 2021,positive,best scifi movie in the last decade frank herbert wouldve been thrilled to see this the intricate dance between the acting storyline visuals and score were done to a perfection its not only a great first watch but also incredibly rewatchabledue in part to the stellar cinematography and jw score i just hope there are more dune films to come with denis villeneuve continuing to direct them
Dec 5 2021,positive,this is one of the best movies i have watched soundtrack is the best i have ever heard action story acting and characters is perfect i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes scifi genre or read dune books
Dec 5 2021,positive,its hard to rate movies like this for me as i have read the book and watched other interpretations of it i enjoyed this movie but i feel if you have not had any history with dune you might get a bit lost id recommend it still and wish part 2 was sooner
Dec 5 2021,positive,fantastic movie  dialogue acting cinematgraphy are awesome
Dec 5 2021,positive,i thought it was good and would have 5 stared it but its a bit of a slow burn and that feels weird in sifi the acting was good and it was visually  appealing
Dec 5 2021,positive,i am a long time fan of the frank herbert books there is absolutely no way any film is going to include all the nuance of the original material but if youve read the book this movie does a good job of providing a canvas upon which you can superimpose your recollections it is visually and aurally stunning however its not perfect lady jessica is somewhat more neurotic than i recall from the book id have preferred a stronger more calculating representation not sure i liked the casting of thufir howat the portrayal was a bit too much like father xmas for my liking not the grizzled formidable character he should have been as for lietkynes duncanbrewsters performance is good enough but i just dont follow the reasoning behind the gender swap the fatherdaughter relationship between kynes and chani is clearly established in the book and all the casting did was to yank me out of the story because it jarred with my recollection of the book built up over decades of rereading still no fault with duncanbrewster per se and for newcomers this wouldnt be an issue overall a cracking film cant wait for the second instalment
Dec 5 2021,positive,cant wait for part 2 maybe a children of dune will be in the works afterplease
Dec 5 2021,positive,cinematography is absolutely stunning id not read or seen any previous dune adaptations so the story felt fresh and new the characters are interesting and i think the 2nd part would benefit from developing these in more detail the lore could be confusing to follow at points but i think rewatching the film would cement this i could definitely see myself watching this for years to come great choices for the lead roles incredible villian definitely a mustsee
Dec 5 2021,positive,i read the books long before the first movie and was greatly disappointed in that version but i also understood that it was a very complex story to read and wondered if it could be successfully put into movie format that first movie definitely established it could not be done in single movie   from the moment i saw the first preview i was immediately excited and hopeful   the movie did not disappoint the visuals were stunning the story was not rushed and i think they nailed it matching characters to actors    im so excited to see the next one
Dec 5 2021,positive,beautifully made great effects but lacking some character building and engagement
Dec 5 2021,positive,if you loved herberts book you owe it to yourself to see this adaptation beautifully depicted stunningly wellcast and displaying at every turn a devotion to the source material this a fans film par excellence  if youve never read the book you may enjoy the movie but i think you may have difficulty following the story libraries have many copies of the book and you only need to read the first two thirds prior to seeing this film  it is worth it
Dec 5 2021,positive,i havent seen the original so this was a nice change to the formula for the scifi flicks
Dec 5 2021,positive,finally a movie worth going to the cinema for you know a movie is good when you feel as time flew by i never had any previous knowledge of dune lore but now im completely invested dune part 1 surely creates alot of expectations for the hopefully upcoming sequels
Dec 5 2021,positive,the movie is on point with the novel of dune     love it
Dec 5 2021,positive,really enjoyed it looking forward to the sequel ending this brilliant remake of the book
Dec 5 2021,negative,wtf why how just terrible
Dec 5 2021,positive,i really enjoyed it great scifi movie looking forward to the sequel
Dec 5 2021,positive,visually stunning without being too grandioseselfcongratulatory about it  in terms of content  it doesnt really convey much of anything on its own  while whether or not the remaining parts will help with that  remains to be seen
Dec 5 2021,positive,compelling storyline fantastic action
Dec 5 2021,positive,dune as it was meant to be seen amazing experience missing out if you dont watch it in imax
Dec 5 2021,positive,so many stars but so little dune the sequels must flow  mmmm shai hulud
Dec 5 2021,positive,david lynch famously brought his dune vision to the screen in 1984 the film score for dune was composed by the rock group toto their first and only film score  its sublime    for those who havent read the book  including myself  the 137minute movie is a bizarre collection of characters sets endless references of spice and constant internal dialogues that serve as narration frankly the voiceovers are probably needed to help escort novice viewers    as a side note princess irulans virginia madsen opening introduction is vastly helpful i am pointing this out as if one is not familiar with lore of dune lynches film despite what critics and fans may have said about the effort  i personally think it is excellent a film that gives lsd hallucinations without taking lsd it is a great starting point even though liberties were taken  to learn the lore and charterers herberts novel    well here we are on earth in 2021 56 years after herberts novel 37 after lynchs film  villeneuves dune arrived in theatres and hbo max and soon to be bluray  uhd if you want to see denis villeneuves latest scifi masterpiece in the third dimension it is getting a 3d usa bluray release yes you heard it here first  i have already preoreded my dune 2021 3d copy its going to be absolutely brilliant    dune contains a depth of worldbuilding that is seldom matched in science fiction dune also showcase powerful and influential religious figures in the all female bene gesserit witches  classic myths with the ledged in the dune universe kwisatz haderach is an old chakobsa term that translates to shortening of the way ie folding space and time for space travel the kwisatz haderach must be male the bene gesserit have been carving the way for the mythical figure for centuries through selective breeding10000 years of breeding to be precise    dune titled onscreen as dune part one is a movie adaptation of frank herberts original novel of the same name it adapts about the first half of the novel    the year is 10191    a substance dubbed spice is the most coveted commodity in the universe because its essential for interstellar travel spice  also named spice melange  is only found on one planet arrakis a desolate desert rock where scorching temperatures fall between unbearable and unlivable if that wasnt rough enough giant humansucking worms  that are a couple of hundred yards long  could rumble from the sand and swallow you up in one bite    the freman who live below the surface live on arrakis and the dark orange spice  which looks like sand  seems to be everywhere    a mythic and emotionally charged heros journey dune tells the story of paul atreides a brilliant and gifted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding who must travel to the most dangerous planet in the universe to ensure the future of his family and his people as malevolent forces explode into conflict over the planets exclusive supply of the most precious resource in existencea commodity capable of unlocking humanitys greatest potentialonly those who can conquer their fear will survive    the movie is epic in scope this 165milliondollar celluloid creation offers a spectacular visual experience    dune is so masterfully shot that you could watch this movie on mute and still be entertained    the cinematography is truley oscar worthy     as a longtime fan of david lynchs film dune it was inevitable i would go into denis villeneuves effort ready to find any fault lynchs dune is a sentimental cinematic treasure to me and i am not willing to give it up i was pleasantly surprised  i mean the source material is so fascinating with rich story telling and depth of character development it would be hard for it not to succeed and dune 2021 does just that    the casting is very well put together alisters  oscar isaac zendaya jason momoa javier bardem josh brolin and stellan skarsgård but the standouts are the two leads timothée chalamet  as the lead character paul atreides followed by rebecca ferguson as lady jessica a concubine and member of the bene gesserit a sect of women who through mental conditioning have the superhuman ability to manipulate others and influence humanity for their own benefit in many ways it is fergusons movie ferguson is a pleasure to witness in the 236 minute run time she is absolutely stunning and brings emotional depth to her character with her acting the film hinges on their motherson relationship and ferguson balances her characters maternal anxieties and soldier like toughness with ease    dune occasionally struggles with its unwieldy source material but those issues are largely overshadowed by the scope and ambition of this visually thrilling adaptation denis villeneuves dune looks and sounds amazing  and once the admittedly slowbuilding story gets you hooked youll be on the edge of your seat for the sequel it can not come soon enough  810dune part one2021
Dec 5 2021,positive,its excellent what else can i say
Dec 5 2021,positive,very well done and imagined in a way that i really liked also the actors did a rather decent job living up to what a lot of readers expected for film adaptations of the characters
Dec 5 2021,positive,if you dont see this movie youre missing out on one of the greatest book to film movies ever created
Dec 5 2021,positive,great movie  best to see in imax
Dec 5 2021,positive,we 42 to 14yo and 75yo all loved it and cant wait for the next part  excellent story line and good effects  we are now emotionally invested  good time
Dec 5 2021,positive,i have to admit i was bracing myself for another remake that was a sad modernized in the worst possible ways offering that leaves one inevitable disappointed but dune was actually very good i enjoyed denis blade runner otherwise i would not have wagered the amount of a movie ticket on this one  surprisingly unspoiled by agenda
Dec 5 2021,positive,part 1 is slow and spends a lot of time world building and introducing you to the characters ok its a bit boring but worth it
Dec 5 2021,positive,cant  wait for part 2
Dec 4 2021,negative,two stars for the incredible visuals it felt like being very aware of watching a movie instead of being in it the characters had no depth the storyline was too slow and the music was too omnipresent almost annoying too much is like not enough great movies dont only have incredible imageries thats why this one will not be remembered as such for me  hope the next one is more balanced
Dec 4 2021,positive,you simply have to see this movie the cinematography is fantastic the adaptation is very close to the book some important characters have been left out but maybe they will appear in part 2
Dec 4 2021,negative,one of the main motifs of the film is dreams a motif that was presented too convincingly to its viewers by the overstretched nonsensical dialogue short mediocre action sequences and overly unnecessary emotionless closeup shots not to mention that the film abruptly ends just as it begins to feel slightly exciting making the experience feel like an expensive long trailer
Dec 4 2021,positive,it definitely has some flaws the cgi at times looks cheap and unfinished the action is not the best and the music is underwhelming to say the least but the movie is so good that it didnt bother me that much its a tricky book to adapt and they did a great job with this one
Dec 4 2021,negative,one of the most boring movies ever was a complete waste of 3 hours of my life
Dec 4 2021,positive,denis villeneuves highly anticipated scifi adaptation is finally here after several delays due to the pandemic and although its far from perfect its an ambitious achievement thats worth experiencing on the big screen if dune gets one thing right its definitely the stunning visuals everything from the cinematography to the production design is brilliant and makes the story come alive the cast is another praiseworthy aspect of the film especially chalamet who was surprisingly very fitting for his lead role my biggest issue is the movies unnecessary leisurely runtime of two and a half hours its way too slow for the events that take place my second issue is the questionable source material with its undeniably problematic plot points in the end dune is recommended to all fantasy lovers who will surely find it entertaining despite of what everyone has to say about it
Dec 4 2021,positive,amazing movie cant wait for a 2nd one
Dec 4 2021,positive,my eyes never left the screen its absoutly beautiful to look at  i tuned off in my head what was being said  never understood what it was really about
Dec 4 2021,negative,never read the books or saw the original so i had no clue what was going on they didnt explain a damn thing boring fell asleep several people walked out before it ended and i nearly left too total waste of money to see this and hours of my time hated it
Dec 4 2021,positive,i loved this movie  what a difference from the old lynch version which was so convoluted and boring  cant wait to see it again and part two
Dec 4 2021,positive,absolute stunning great visuals great music great design much better than the first movie i love it
Dec 4 2021,positive,a storytelling level i would expect from every movie brings me back to the times of the first appearances of the greatest cinematographic adventures exquisite
Dec 4 2021,positive,this is one of the best science fiction i have seen in a decade i cant wait for the sequel
Dec 4 2021,positive,loved this movie it has such a sure sense of its narrative and characterisation visually stunning but i found its the quieter moments between characters that stand as the films highlights
Dec 4 2021,negative,it was kind of bland and and fast paced there were no moments to digest the world and the visuals just werent satisfying for me
Dec 4 2021,negative,poorly matched actors flat acting unnecessary changes to the technology which in a scifi needs to be well thought out there was very little lore explained to those new to the series which leaves all factions from the series without any of dunes signature mystique not even the special effects were that good clearly this was a film made so you will pay for the name as there was very little effort denis frenchname is obviously not a frank herbert fan 110
Dec 4 2021,positive,definitely worth seeing in theaters
Dec 4 2021,positive,film of the year stupendous  on every level acting dialogue  cinematography  is amazing a must see 
Dec 4 2021,positive,my wife and i saw this on hbo max and loved it then a few days later when i don had stopped over my wife started telling him about it and we watched it again with him that weekend the three of us went and say it in imax about an hour away and due fyi severe back pain i rarely get out even in town but it was worth the few days off extra pain and despite rhaving seen it twice already on a 70 plasma seeing it in imax was amazing    this was the shortest long movie ive ever seen as it felt like it was at most 90 minutes long despite being much longer    i cant wait to go to see part 1 as the first part of a double feature followed immediately by part 2 itll be a long day at the theater but it will definitely be worth it    i dont expect a directors cut as this released is supposedly exactly what he wanted but if theres a longer version released it now please
Dec 4 2021,positive,it is very rare to walk out of the theatre shaking from what you just experienced dune is a bombardment of the senses in the very best way possible it is truly a film that needs to be experienced in the theatre my jaw was open in awe the whole time admiring the cinematography sound design music and special effects every single frame is gorgeous and helmed with such care i knew nothing of dune coming into it but i am completely sold on this world and cant wait for part 2 this is a film lovers wet dream and is a must see
Dec 4 2021,positive,a bit slow but the story carries the movie the cinematography is top notch
Dec 4 2021,positive,from beginning to end dune was epic enthralling and beautiful  the score was stunning and its hands down the best scifi film ive ever seen
Dec 4 2021,negative,only reason this movie gets 1 star instead of 12 is the graphics and special effects are pretty solid  otherwise this is probably the worst movie i have ever had to sit through  the movie accomplishes in 25 hours what it could have easily captured in 40 min  drawn out story line with little true substance to the movie itself  if youre a fan of the book and hellbent on seeing the movie at least do yourself the favor and wait to watch it for free
Dec 4 2021,positive,dune is one of those rare occasions where a remake is just as good if not better than the original series or movie it builds on a solid performance by all characters to a point where you dont want it to end then subtly concludes making you look forward to part 2
Dec 4 2021,positive,being a fan of the books i was excited to see dune on the big screen it didnt disappoint in term of a visual spectacle amazing  cinematography and world building
Dec 4 2021,positive,stunning visuals and terrific performances accompanied by a first rate score i loved it
Dec 4 2021,positive,epic movie best movie off the year what aaa story man i am excited to sequel
Dec 4 2021,positive,fantastic beautiful with an incredible score dune is a fabulous start to a trilogy
Dec 3 2021,neutral,you must read the book to get anything out of this movie  it was produced extremely well the cgi was done so tactfully well that it wasnt noticeable finally a movie that knows less is more  but the screenplay and acting is rather wooden  its not possible to relate the characters less empathize with any one of them  therefore it just goes flat they try with trying to build tension in scenes but i found myself barely paying attention  ambitious but too wooden in the human element
Dec 3 2021,positive,brilliant i highly recommended it
Dec 3 2021,positive,good picture bad storytelling
Dec 3 2021,positive,i loved science fiction from my early teens today sf seems to be synonymous to an overload of cgi and in the case of star wars a never ending complex story of whos whos father dune is back to basics a straight line story but made with such care for the basics in movie making great colour great scenery great costumes and of course cgi but of the necessary kind its back to basics of what a great sf movie should be if you like sf movies to allow you to leave enough for your own imagination and not for drowning in special effects you will love this one i was sad when it ended i wanted it to go on
Dec 3 2021,positive,a very faithful and mature adaptation of the sci fi classic
Dec 3 2021,neutral,i really wanted to like this movie maybe if i had watched it on the big screen i would have liked it more but the pacing was just so slow and there was so much they could have cut
Dec 3 2021,positive,amazing visuals and stuck to the story quite well i was slightly concerned they might not do part 2 though
Dec 3 2021,positive,looks like a movie that would have been made in 20 years couldnt believe this was made in the current year
Dec 3 2021,positive,great start hopefully they keep it up
Dec 3 2021,positive,its big and epic and some say its slow  but it is visually and aurally fantastic chalamet and mom ferguson are a winning combo its been a long time since something of this size was attempted and executed well
Dec 3 2021,positive,a good beging film   truly toptier production from the ost to the cinematography its all there while i did give this a lower score it will probably change as this series continues
Dec 3 2021,positive,weirdly enough i had never heard anything about dune so wasnt really sure what to expect but i was not disappointed there was never a dull moment and i thought  timothe chalamet did an amazing job cant wait for the next movie
Dec 3 2021,positive,this is a very good rendition of dune  the special effects are great  the characters are well played  i absolutely love this versions baron harkonen   the only thing that may put off some viewers is how drawn out the story is  and the fact that it stops half way through the first part of the first book      i loved it  but casual frank herbert or dune fans might now  it was very much akin to lord of the rings  i cant wait to see the second half
Dec 3 2021,positive,an excellent interpretation of the complex frank herbert epic  acting and special effects were outstanding  having familiarity with at least the original book and david lynch movie version from the 80s is helpful
Dec 3 2021,positive,amazing 1010 this quality of movie is how they should be made a masterpiece
Dec 3 2021,positive,the movie is not very friendly to new audience of the dune universes imo
Dec 3 2021,positive,oh my god this is every dune fans dream come true finally the adaptation weve been waiting for as a person who is a die hard fan of the novel this did not disappoint in the slightest all i can say is you need to go see this on the big screen and see it in imax this is the intended and in my opinion the only way to experience it easily on par with lotr and original star wars give me part 2 asap    ps i dont give 5 stars out often this is honestly something special
Dec 3 2021,neutral,oh my gosh im so dissapointed the pacing is dreadful i was just waiting the whole 2 and half hours for something really cool to happen but it just  didnt 
Dec 3 2021,positive,really enjoyed it cant wait for more
Dec 3 2021,positive,okayi have not read the books so i didnt have prior knowledge before watching the film but oh my god is it really good first off the cinematography is absolutely incredible and is some of the best cinematography ive ever seen the acting costume design sound design set design were all on point and was absolutely incredible watching this film in vmaximax is the best way to see it the music is very strong and hits hard in the theatre and it gives a menacing feeling and also gives a sense of scale and intensity han zimmer really knocked it out of the park with this one the reason why its not a full 5 stars is just the fact that some of the scenes dragged not that it was boring it was just a bit too slow this film is a slow burner and really takes its time to establish everything and tell the story the action is absolutely amazing and when it came i was on the edge of my seat this film is definitely worth watching and i highly recommend it
Dec 3 2021,positive,a reasonably good adaption of the source material  they indulged in the common hollywood practice of changing characters into black women for no reason but apart from that its quite good  great desert scenery and such  very nice colours effects sounds  its quite slow in parts but so is the book  id say its one of the better versions of dune
Dec 3 2021,positive,exceptional casting production design visual effects and sound contribute to a stunning adaptation of frank herberts classic the film handles the source material with reverence and transports you successfully to the mysterious desert planet of arrakis well worth making the trip to the cinema for this one i cant wait for the sequel
Dec 3 2021,positive,its a huge advantage to have read the books so knowing the story  the visuals are amazing and the acting is great  type ii civilizations reaching towards type iii are so much fun
Dec 3 2021,positive,closest anyone has come to the books in my opinion fantastic cinematography great cast and performance i didnt even notice how long the film was i was totally immersed cant wait for october 2023
Dec 3 2021,positive,denis villeneuve creates a reserved yet captivating world the film is expertly cast and each actor quickly becomes their character having grown up on the david lynch version i was eager to see villeneuves take on the story many of the key scenes appear in both the lynch and villeneuve versions villeneuve however crafts an original being visually stunning and based in reality this film makes it easy to suspend belief and the characters and story to carry you off there was an obvious choice to make the characters the point of the film and not the special effects i also loved the variation of the messiah trope
Dec 3 2021,negative,boring movie of the year no story at all no proper ending wasted my 2 and half hours highly unrecommended
Dec 3 2021,positive,great blend of book and movie artistry
Dec 3 2021,negative,i was looking forward to seeing dune for the past month when it came to the theatre yesterdayi went to see it and i was very disappointedit was not what i expectedtoo loudthe charactersget killed off too quicklyi had hoped to see jason mamomato have a much greater role throughout the movieand the same with zendayashe did not appear in the movie till right to the endit left two charactersthe mother and sonnot a great storyalot of killingnot enough special effectsthe two greatest moviesi have seen in the last couple of weeks are the best ive seen for along timethey arethe eternalsand shang chithey are excellent made movies  i really was not impressed at all with this movie dune
Dec 2 2021,positive,finally a worthy movie to enjoy if you read dune and ever imagined what hurbert was discribing this movie nails it waiting for part 2 
Dec 2 2021,negative,big fan of villeneuve however he lost me on this one it has its merits especially with the visuals but even these i found bland after a while i just couldnt connect with the characters and found myself monumentally bored despite the scale and depths of the story timothy chalamets is perhaps the very embodiment of my experience hes not a bad actor but comes across as bland monotone and distant if not a bit wooden
Dec 2 2021,positive,the adaptation weve been waiting for my only regret is that they didnt film both parts simultaneously like peter jackson did with lotr so we have to wait a couple years for the conclusion 
Dec 2 2021,positive,the movies is okay with some glaring issues fans of the first movie and the book will instantly notice but a decent setup for the good part of the story
Dec 2 2021,positive,it spent more time setting up the next movie than telling the story at hand however the movie was still quite enjoyable
Dec 2 2021,positive,this was pretty much everything i wanted it to be the acting was great the visuals were as stunning as you would hope and the story telling was both visual and not just force fed like the original    well done and a great follow up to blade runner 2049 for directing
Dec 2 2021,positive,stunning visuals drags at times and i got more on a second watch im very excited to see where it goes from here and i intend to read the books now as well
Dec 2 2021,positive,i really loved dune the action set pieces were phenomenal but the focus was almost always on the characters
Dec 2 2021,positive,i liked the way the movie was true to the book the acting and the world that was created was excellent
Dec 2 2021,positive,this movie is great must see
Dec 2 2021,positive,wow this is one for the ages
Dec 2 2021,negative,enjoyable aesthetics without substance   if you are a fan of the literary saga you probably wont enjoy it given the changes introduced and the general lack of respect for an essential literary work of art
Dec 2 2021,negative,almost entirely soulless and surprisingly boring for a movie with such dramatic scenes and so many explosions i found myself looking at my watch far more often than is healthy and the arrival of the closing credits filled me with no emotion more prominent than relief
Dec 2 2021,positive,i loved every minute of this movie it takes the best of the novel and leaves the bits that for me didnt work as well definitely plan to watch again and again
Dec 2 2021,positive,refreshing to see a genre film that rewards the  perhaps a tad too patient pondering perceptive filmgoer visually striking villanueve showing himself to be a genuine tour de force in modern science fiction cinema part 2 cannot come soon enough
Dec 2 2021,positive,absolutely incredible i loved the world building the art and costumes the director of photography did a fabulous job and hans zimmer wrote a fantastic soundtrack for this wonderful film
Dec 2 2021,positive,a little too long for the story and the plot but im definitely looking forward to seeing whats happening next a decent introduction to dune
Dec 2 2021,positive,a solid sci fi epic which is a pretty faithful adaptation to part of the book dune
Dec 2 2021,positive,remarkable spectacle this is an epic film with fantastic performances and mind blowing special effects i expect several academy award nominations and wins it doesnt hurt to have a basic knowledge of the story and the characters but not necessary a treat for serious scifi fans
Dec 2 2021,positive,saw it in imax and it was glorious great interpretation of the book want to see it again
Dec 2 2021,positive,absolutely loved it
Dec 1 2021,positive,great movie more satisfying if you read the book
Dec 1 2021,negative,went too see dune last night gotta say i was severely disappointed barely hit a third of the storyline and way way too many long pauses staring at an unspeaking actor with the expectation that youll figure out what they are thinking if i never read the books or saw the other versions i would have been totally lost and completely underwhelmed either of the previous dune films were 20x better that said the cinematography was great but the movie lacked the ability to tell the story and the fantastic nuances within it could have been epic just a bit of internal monologue or god anythingjust anything to fill in the details im just sad im also sad to post this as it may prevent them from making the other half the only half that may actually redeem the storyline this entire episode was just a setup for part two which may never come just sad
Dec 1 2021,negative,really boring throughout the movie no humour buildup too long ending sucks
Dec 1 2021,negative,i found this movie to being a boring slog which was a massive disappointment because i really love the idea of dune and i loved both bladerunner and arrival at the start this film felt like it was going to be just my cup of tea but as it went on i grew less and less interested in what the story has to offer perhaps if i was a fan of the books id have enjoyed this more but im coming at this as someone who has only seen this film as their introduction to the dune universe a universe i have no real interest in ever visiting after watching this     i dont want to be too harsh on the movie as it was beautiful and everyone played their parts very well however it did the biggest crime of any bit of entertainmentit left me feeling like i had wasted the only thing i can earn more of my time     i dont need a movie to be full of action or comedy for me to enjoy it i am a massive fan of what i call boringly entertaining movies a long boring movie that has me thinking is so much better and memorable than most of what is offered up in modern times thats the thing i need a movie thats going to be long and boring to make me think and this didnt in the most brash why for me to put it it was just shit happening for nearly 3 hours nothing really deep to think about no meat to chew on     sure the argument could be made that this story is about colonization and capitalism but thats honestly all there is to it not really that deep when the same ideas are expressed in a 60 second tiktok     i wish i could have enjoyed this i really do
Dec 1 2021,positive,spectacular one of the best films ive seen period
Dec 1 2021,positive,its been almost a month since i saw this movie and ive watched it 3 times simply amazing the book is amazing denis villeneuve always excels im a fan of his works if i could define this movie in a few words these would be amazing beautiful and passionate
Dec 1 2021,positive,it was a good movie if youre not a patient movie watcher youll get tested with this one glad i saw it in theaters
Dec 1 2021,negative,i wanted to place 1 star the special effects are good so i placed 2  i was eager to see a couple of things in this movie  1  how navigators will be depicted  2  how interstellar travel is presented  3  to see te final battle    what i saw and i wasnt expecting  spit  now i like that strange dune from 84 even more
Dec 1 2021,positive,villanueve did an amazing job adapting a monstrous book into a spectacle of film the anticipation for the sequel is immense
Dec 1 2021,neutral,i wish i hadnt seen the 1984 version as poorly as that one was done it gave you a full understanding of the scope of the storyand the satisfaction of a conclusion this one seemed to have too much focus on setcostume design stunning as it was it lacked the narrative the first one offered i watched the current version on hbo max then went on youtube and rewatched the 1984 version again
Dec 1 2021,positive,it is the winner of 6 oscars so yeah
Dec 1 2021,positive,considering its only half a film its one of the best scifi films ever made
Dec 1 2021,negative,i completely understand im going to be in the minority here let me start by saying the film visually is great i love the world building and everything looks fantastic the acting is good but the problem is beyond that this film is pretty dull there was so much exposition maybe this story just works better as a book im generally someone who prefers a slow burner rather than the trashy all out modern movie but this was excruciating i respect people who like this film thats absolutely your right and opinion for me personally and film is all about personal opinion i found it boring and a complete snooze fest that i struggled to get through which is a shame because i was really hoping to like it
Dec 1 2021,positive,its like star wars with a tinge lord of the rings its of epic scale with excellent world creation watch it in 3d
Dec 1 2021,positive,movie looked cool at some times but it was kind of boring i dont think its bad its just not for me
Dec 1 2021,negative,i would say its the worst most boring movie since gravityyet both films had so little happen refuse to call either of them a filmif i had not been with a friend id have walked out of dune about half an hour into itover 90 minutes later the 2 hour slog had no action scenesno storyno characters worth caring about and so little happening i was wondering why it hadnt been cut down to the first 10 minutesits like the prologue before a real film will then show the films title before getting into the actioninstead dune was just a 2 hour prologue that had no pay off and left me annoyed not only at wasted moneybut i could have had 2 hours extra in bed although i did nod off at one point i was so extremely bored
Dec 1 2021,positive,very good movie good acting and atmosphere a proof that holywood can produce good stuff if they use their brains and dont try to push an agenda
Dec 1 2021,positive,beautiful wellacted engaging and intriguiging i had not watched any previous iterations nor had i read the book yet i was comfortably able to follow understand and enjoy the movie must watch in the cinema
Dec 1 2021,positive,i loved the 84 dune but the 21 version is less rushed more cinematic and felt more true to the book
Dec 1 2021,positive,what a ride  went to see this twice and i could watch it a thousand times  as a kid i used to be a big fan of lynchs dune which did not stand the test of time to say the least  so seeing a proper adaptation of herbets book was a long overdue pleasure  villeneuve has an unmistakable style in pace lighting shapes framing music  every single scene is cared for every character has the right actor every line is carefully crafted and oh this is so visually stunning  it is great to see some references to the old movie after all the source material is the same but what is even better is the fact that this film will stand the test of time  could it be better yes of course nothing is perfect  some cuts made in editing resulted in some scenes or characters changing tone or mood a bit too abruptly within seconds but again these are minor issues to an already excellent product
Dec 1 2021,negative,the movie is extremely boring nothing happens it seems like an eternal prelude that never solves itself its just a good visual experience the way the story is shown is very bad
Dec 1 2021,negative,man was this film boring boring boring 
Dec 1 2021,positive,incredibly well done usually my biggest fear with an allstar cast is that the movie wont find a sense of grounding and realism but the director makes a great job making the plot digestible despite the heavy source material it had the right amount of exposition to not lose the audience in the first 30 min of the film i also enjoyed the attention to detail brought to the story combined with a  fantastic score which is breathtaking to watch on the big screen
Dec 1 2021,negative,is like star wars and game of thrones have a little baby and this baby was bored as hell
Dec 1 2021,positive,at first i was a little bored at the beginning of the movie mainly because i didnt know too well what the movie was going to be about but it turned out pretty interesting i cant wait for the second movie to come out
Dec 1 2021,positive,beautiful cinematography  wish more happened though
Dec 1 2021,positive,a brilliant movie that proves that when something is called unfilmable it is not always true
Dec 1 2021,positive,lighting in the movie too dark difficult to see characters and film sets  decent special effects
Nov 30 2021,negative,this movie is boring sure the visual effects and music are good but wheres the story wheres the sci in scifi it seemed like one long fight scene to me characters are forgettable it goes on too long i was very disappointed im glad i saw it on 7 tuesday
Nov 30 2021,neutral,while dune 2021 is much better than dune 1984 i still felt like i needed to read the novel to truly appreciate the film the visual effects are spectacular and the acting is solid but there were parts of the movie that lost me theres just so much going on and its kind of hard to follow if youre not already a fan still i think denis villeneuve is a great director and im interested to see where the next movie goes
Nov 30 2021,positive,i need that second movie
Nov 30 2021,positive,visually impressive and distinctive captures something of the weight of the novel a lot of commentary has focused on how the lynch dune was idiosyncratic in many ways aesthetically it was and yet scene for scene i was surprised by how many of the beats were similar i kind of felt myself longing for the old dialogue in the gom jabbar scene and saying it quietly to myself im excited for part 2 and my only real knock on this as an adaptation is that i didnt think lady jessica was really nailed as a character here a little too much damsel in distress not quite enough iwillmeddleinyourreligion badassery
Nov 30 2021,positive,91    after failed attempts at bringing the dune story to the big screen due to the sheer amount of content to cover denis villeneuve manages to successfully tackle and present the story in the best possible way well at least half of the story as shown in the beginning of the film this is only the first part of the book so it could be easy to not be fully invested as you wont get a final conclusion to the story however the way dune 2021 is told in its 150 minute runtime feels natural explaining everything the viewer needs to know in a simple way rather than the confusing narration of dune 1984    finishing on an incomplete conclusion was expected from the start however it never distracted away from the story being told villeneuve has crafted a new world on screen which many will love an easy comparison to make is star wars however dune 2021 is still nothing like which shows how unique of a film it is    as usual with a villeneuve film the cinematography is outofthisworld also hugely impacted by hans zimmers score dune 2021 tells a wonderful story yet is only half way through completing it which will look to be completed in an inevitable dune part ii
Nov 30 2021,positive,really indepth and fascinating production design of the highest caliber a challenging unusual score with an unusual take on incidental music  noise and a unique combination of practical and special effect including a unique approach to screening generally well cast although it inexplicably and randomly veers wildly offbook in a few cases to detriment and has significant pacing issues key elements of worldbuilding from the books are completely ignored unfortunately or glossed over in favor of other elements otherwise it would have gotten higher marks the quality and layout of viewing venues sound systems seem to significantly effect the experience  we had trouble even hearing dialogue at times as the score and sound effects drowned it out
Nov 30 2021,positive,one the the best movies i have seen in a long time cinematography acting soundtrack plot and character execution are all very well done its such a breath of fresh air from the mediocre media thats been thrown at us in recent years i can not recommend this movie enough
Nov 30 2021,positive,this is a beautiful film great adaptation
Nov 30 2021,positive,fans of the novel will appreciate this film
Nov 30 2021,positive,loved this movie i have seen it 3 times hurry up with the second one
Nov 30 2021,positive,i absolutely loved this film  it is without a doubt the best scifi film i have seen and does the books justice
Nov 30 2021,negative,really not a great film felt like a badly scripted mash up of star wars and game of thrones but didnt care about any of the characters because they had no depth it felt random
Nov 29 2021,positive,does a good job of conveying the concepts of the book with fantastic visuals giving the movie an epic feel cant wait for part 2
Nov 29 2021,positive,a return to form for movies this is the science fiction formed on the truth of old the breathtaking visuals have the cinematic weight to draw you in the music has an epic feel though it wasnt to my taste while many feel that it was too slow i feel it was providing time for the plot to breathe dune is an epic and you dont run a marathon by sprinting full speed over the route
Nov 29 2021,positive,aside from the slowness and restraint of the first half as a result of which the overall duration shows a bit and the fact that this is essentially not a standalone movie but part 1 of 2 dune is incredibly wellmade visually fascinating but also cerebrally and emotionally engaging the direction photography sound music and cast are all topnotch and the themes and characters very captivating in short it has epic written all over it
Nov 29 2021,positive,well done adaptation
Nov 29 2021,positive,loved the movie stuck close to the book  characters was great  worth watching
Nov 29 2021,negative,doesnt even come close to being as good as the original dune and the cliffhanger ending really ruined it for me  cant recommend this one
Nov 29 2021,positive,a ton of information needs to be digested to understand the story i feel like itd be much more easy to follow and more enjoyable with a second viewing 
Nov 29 2021,positive,i liked the movie even though it had to cut corners storywise but that is unavoidable with this huge story especially concerning the intricate political realities i thought the music was a bit overkill in most places and overreaching to bludgeon the audience into understanding this is a really epic moment in case you had not noticed yeah we kind of got it  the cast is a mixed bag and i will make some comparisons to david lynchs version even if he disowned it first of all i like thimotée chalamet as paul sorry kyle love you man but that part did not suit you rebecca ferguson as jessica was bland and uninteresting but at least not a cyphre as in lynchs version somehow she is apparently hard to bring to life from the books not sure why  leto atreides played by oscar isaac well who cares really but id have to give it to jürgen prochnow i mean unbeatable in terms of charisma even though he had so little to work with still made the character memorable  ole vlad harkonnen  well done in both movies i like evil to have a brain and both embodiments a lot of body showed that but id have to give it to stellan skarsgard as in lynchs movie kenneth mcmillan is brilliant but comes accross more as a raving lunatic which deminishes the character but still left a lasting impression as he did it so well hmm cant choose yet  of course no one can beat the great brad dourif as piter nough said beast rabban is a toss up dont know yet really no doubt the second movie will also feature feyd rautha but sting was a bit ridiculous so not hard to improve on that  duncan is still a bit of a sketchily worked out character but jason momoa was ok in the part what little there was but the books themselves do not do much with the character even though he features in different forms throughout most of the books and it is an important character but herbert never really fleshed him out proper so it also shows in the adaptations  javier bardem well i watch him in anything but we havent seen much as yet of stilgar but hell do great no doubt  josh brolin is a better fit for gurney halleck than patrick stewart as far as physique and personality go mr stewart obviously is an accomplished actor but he was simply miscast for that part  sian philips as the reverend mother mohiam of course was not to be beaten by even a great actress like charlotte rampling i mean she was that part and in my mind is forever locked into it  im very sorry but i cannot for the life of me remember the actress playing chani in the first movie which is not surprising as again she is a badly written character in the books which again is weird seeing who she will become to paul but even reading the books i kept forgetting about her  visually the movie is amazingly looking as villeneuve keeps proving with any movie he has made sofar the man knows how to impress in that area  it was to me the only redeeming quality of his blade runner sequel which i disliked  as an uninteresting story especially considering the original but thats another topic  all in all i really liked the movie and definitely want to see the sequel even though it clocked at 25  hours it was not slow i rather wanted it to just continue so thats a good sign  good effort but will it become legendary and seen as a cinema classic i doubt it  damn i wished jodorowsky would have realized his version it would probably have had very little to do with the books but damn if it wouldnt have been an instant classic ah well like the stones sagely stated you cant always get what you want  did i get what i need nah not really but i was successfully entertained and i guess that is one of the reasons movies are made
Nov 29 2021,positive,probably the best scifi the year very loyal to the content  it is based on frank herberts sci fi  epics the best way to describe it it is a mix between  game of thrones and star wars with the color pallet of blade runner 2049 it has to be noted that the story pre dates all the mentioned and has influenced  them all in short it is an absolute success visually stunning entertaining and captivating
Nov 29 2021,negative,i thought this movie was paced far too slow i understand that its only part 1 but they needed to shave off about 45 minutes of run time it was boring for the most part and when the action did come it was short lived and nothing special a snooze fest that the pretty visuals and dramatic score couldnt overcome its a movie that despite the artsy visuals i felt like id seen before and seen better its just no fun i also didnt particularly like any of the characters except for jason mamoas i usually love movies like this and was disappointed also there were too many scenes where i couldnt understand what the characters were saying 
Nov 29 2021,positive,this version of the movie stayed extremely close to the book the visual effects and scenes were very well done much more satisfying than the original movie which is extremely rare to say about any remake
Nov 29 2021,positive,my most anticipated movie of the past two years has finally arrived i saw this at the amc empire 25 imax with a sold out crowd and let me tell you the only way to watch this movie is in a movie theater this is such a visual and audial spectacle that you need the full frame surround sound and a bucket of popcorn unless you have a giant tv and an amazing sound system youre not going to get the same experience as in a theater        the performances across the board are absolutely fantastic surprisingly rebecca ferguson and jason mamoa gave my favorite performances timothee chalamet is able to communicate so much through his eyes and denis villeneuve really understood and utilized that skill        it wasnt the movie i thought it would be as someone who knew nothing about dune other than the basic synopsis i expected it to be a more intense experience but its a very emotional film which is something i shouldve expected with it being a villeneuve film but it did exceed a lot of my expectations
Nov 29 2021,positive,most faithful book adaptation i can remember  liked  almost all the visuals are just as i imagined if not better than when i read it 30 years ago  disliked  beyond the obvious having to wait 2 years to see the rest of the story not crazy about all the cast but they were good enough
Nov 29 2021,positive,great visuals good adaptation of story  cant wait for the next dune movie
Nov 29 2021,positive,pretty accurately follows the book but if you havent read the book s you can still understand the story
Nov 29 2021,positive,looks incredible ive never read the books but it appears to be a faithful adaptation it felt about 30 minutes longer than it needed to be
Nov 29 2021,positive,true to source material wellacted good special effects
Nov 29 2021,positive,this movie was great i havent read the books but i loved the pacing some are saying it was to slow but i disagree 3 hrs is no longer abnormal for a movie and we like to see better character and plot development then the traditional 1 12 hr rush please make the rest of the dune movies like this
Nov 29 2021,negative,to much sandi dont like sandits course and rough and irritatingand it gets everywhere
Nov 29 2021,positive,my son said i had to go  im glad i did  id not seen the older movie nor read the book  im eagerly awaiting part 2
Nov 29 2021,negative,the original was better added to much fillers to make in two movies what was done in one
Nov 29 2021,positive,been a while since a great fantasy came out
Nov 28 2021,positive,was it slow yes was it beautiful action packed and obviously only half a narrative also yes 
Nov 28 2021,positive,if people are expecting star wars theyre going to be disappointed its not a full story but the first part of a 2 part movie what they did some said was impossible not for everybody but fans and the general audiences yes just dont go expecting some dumb popcorn movie
Nov 28 2021,positive,i loved the original and i love this more the epic struggle continues with excellent acting and set design i wish the entire drama and sequels were ready for viewing i would approach it like the ring cycle
Nov 28 2021,positive,if you have read the novel its great to see it play out on the big screen  if you havent you can still enjoy the story
Nov 28 2021,negative,this movie was one of the worst movies i have ever seen the beginning was so slow and the fights were terrible and it was only part one please make the second one better
Nov 28 2021,positive,really great good story and characters
Nov 28 2021,positive,might not be to everyones taste but sails closer to the books epic cinematography that should be seen on a big screen clearly calls back to various other films beyond the brando nod such as arrival 2001 a space odyssey etc
Nov 28 2021,negative,it started off really good but there wasnt really any good fights and it got ridiculously long and boring after the first 20 minutes
Nov 28 2021,neutral,the movie was great  the acoustics were so bad you couldnt hear half the words being said if i hadnt tread the book and seen the movie i would never have been able to figure out the plot the theater said they have no way to enhance the talking without increasing the sound level which was deafening at time  we saw this first of 345 movies at emagine theater in lake geneva wi  it is a wonderful theater with reclining wide seats and food you can buy and eat in the theater  yo order and they bring it to your seat
Nov 28 2021,positive,was amazed a must see cant wait for part 2
Nov 28 2021,positive,great worldbuilding wonderful cinematography perfect music
Nov 28 2021,positive,well done light on the violence  no nudity  redeeming theme and quotable lines
Nov 28 2021,positive,i liked the movie very much  the script writers did a very good job of setting the pace and content with respect to the book  im glad the movie did not try to fit the whole book in one movie  i liked the choices for actors
Nov 28 2021,positive,it was a slow build up but it was required to share the detailed back stories excellent actors the cgi is amazingi truly enjoyed it it had great choreographed fight scenes looking forward to part 2
Nov 28 2021,positive,a beautiful movie that seems to mostly pave the way for the next movie and leaves something to be desired for those who havent read the book
Nov 28 2021,positive,what an incredible cinematic experience not since the original star wars trilogy have i felt so taken to new worlds and lore so marveled by the whole experience and with todays options and all the previous movies that came before it   even if youve read the book previously it continuously captures your attention with the absolutely stunning visual adaptation of your imagination and sense of scale as well as wondering how they managed to show so much lore in so little time
Nov 28 2021,positive,best dune adaptation i have ever seen the scale pace casting artistic design and acting are all perfect for an accurate adaptation of one of my favorite books this is the scifi equivalent of the lotr adaptation lets hope they deliver on the next one
Nov 28 2021,positive,i am usually annoyed by the filmmakers insistence to watch their movies on the big screen but dune is something else this epic sf saga was made to be devoured on the biggest screen possible as its a true audiovisual spectacle the sound is incredible the hans zimmer score is brilliant the cinematography is striking and the vfx are some of the best that weve gotten so far but the movie isnt just hollow spectacle for the masses as it also develops its story properly while the world building themes and the mythology are superbly crafted here the characters are all fantastic and the acting ensemble was surprisingly strong here some of the pacing and structure issues aside this dune is finally a terrific worthy adaptation that fans of the iconic source material deserve on a side note villeneuve really has a thing for massive ships taking off doesnt he
Nov 28 2021,positive,incredible best movie i have seen in a long time will not disappoint dune fans
Nov 28 2021,positive,best movie ive seen in a long while the 25 hour watch time was warped into 15 minutes in my perception i was utterly transfixed
Nov 28 2021,positive,epic the cinematography is incredible  as well as the sound track be hands zimmerman if you lived the books this first installment of the new movie versions is for you this is more like what i imagined as i read it acting is incredible go see it
Nov 28 2021,positive,there are a number of aspects of dune that i found mediocre or wonky but there are even more aspects that were great overall it is a visuallystunning scifi epic that has more world building and depth than most of the shallow movies that come out these days
Nov 28 2021,positive,best movie i have seen in a while awesome story and graphics cant wait for more
Nov 28 2021,positive,amazing true to the books great cinematography
Nov 28 2021,positive,dune is the scifi epic ive always dreamed of massive in scope but detailed and grounded in nature an exciting adventure with flawless special effects and fantastic designs but one that takes advantage of the genre to tell a rich and thematic story rather than just the set dressing to cool action the worldbuilding is a marvel to witness and for 2 hours and 35 minutes i was transported to another world i hate to make the obvious comparison but with so many of these new star wars movies it has just becomes a slideshow of planets we learn what material the planet is made of sand snow salt then we are off to the next one dune crafts a similarly vast and complex world but most of the story takes place in the sandy dunes of arrakis so that we are able to soak in all the culture politics and people some of my favorite scenes are with paul and his father governing the planet and learning the insandouts of the daily operations there are so many details that make the world feel real space portals that allow for intergalactic travel and technology designed to not waste a single drop of water from your body are presented like thats obviously the way things have to be    paul makes for a compelling protagonist an unassuming boy who has the weight of the universe thrust upon his shoulders you can tell he is a studious and bright individual always questioning the world around him and the traditions of his people his relationship with his family and mentors in the house of atreides is refreshingly warm and caring and it made me feel invested the feeling that something is off about there mission is there nearly from the start and keeps the tension during the slower parts as the story progresses pauls visions seem to get more intense and it lends the film a dreamlike quality while creating the mystery of whether these are visions of the future or something else the intergalactic politics are detailed but not overbearingly so i love the game of thronesesque power struggle all centered around the valuable commodity of spice i am also intrigued by the mysterious emperor and witches who seem to have some sort of nefarious plot cooking in the background there are themes about religion colonialism and environmentalism infused that you can draw direct comparisons to issues going on today which just makes this story that much richer    the film is certainly slow to start but its this patient storytelling that pays off by the end once the betrayals high drama and action kick in its pulse pounding and exciting the body shield technology gives the combat scenes an extra layer of strategy as handtohand combat has to evolve the big criticism i see is that this is an incomplete story that ends in a jarring manner maybe i was prepared for this after hearing this warning beforehand but i was satisfied with how this film leaves off paul goes through a complete character arc and has to make a key decision in the climax his character at the end of the film is a far cry from the boy who has lived a sheltered life surrounded by supportive people and struggles to get out of bed so yes dune is easily one of the best blockbusters and scifi films ever made certainly unlike i have ever seen and i havent stopped thinking about its rich world since i left the theater
Nov 28 2021,positive,it disappoint me the mix in the movie of religious connotations that were not in the book and the lack of knowledge by the person who added this in the movie when they heard about the desert they added the religion
Nov 28 2021,positive,best dune adaptation made best movie of 2021
Nov 28 2021,positive,smoother than the original with a better explanation for those who never read the books
Nov 28 2021,positive,it wasnt bad but quite boring at the same time
Nov 28 2021,positive,very true to the books and helps those that havent read understand at the same time
Nov 28 2021,positive,beautiful cinematography and faithful to the book
Nov 28 2021,negative,i definitely have to read the book now just so i can understand what i just watched difficult to follow  some of the dialogue was difficult to hear  way too long for the story that got told
Nov 28 2021,positive,hard to understand what the actors were saying at times
Nov 28 2021,positive,absolutely amazing movie definitely a must watch and i will be watching it again my only issue is that there is no indication to my knowledge at least prior that this is only part 1 and there is another movie but honestly its so good i am glad theres multiple parts couldnt recommend this movie more
Nov 28 2021,positive,an engrossing adaptation with delightful cinematography and spoton casting
Nov 28 2021,negative,very boring i guess its just not for me i dont know what the hype was about i could not follow the storyline the pros of seeing it on imax was the pretty cool sounds thats about it
Nov 28 2021,negative,boring not thrilling and even sometimes stupid
Nov 28 2021,positive,in short extremely long but brilliant prologue for the next film a bit slow at times but promises big for whats to come definite must see dont get drinks
Nov 28 2021,positive,i thought it was a little slow moving however i thought it was a good intro to the movie series
Nov 28 2021,neutral,honestly i enjoyed this more than i liked the book which i think is a longwinded and incoherent mess with a regressive political outlook at least the visuals are stunning and the action moves along
Nov 28 2021,positive,one of the best movies i have watched for a long time amazing sound and picture  looking forward for the next episode
Nov 28 2021,positive,awesome movie from start to finish
Nov 27 2021,positive,dark moody and beautifully atmospheric
Nov 27 2021,positive,very faithful to the book  really compelling characters  cant wait to see part ii
Nov 27 2021,positive,slow burn but didnt mind glad they are making a sequel left wanting more
Nov 27 2021,neutral,could not follow story line
Nov 27 2021,negative,slow moving  confusing plot boring mis cast  did not stay to the end
Nov 27 2021,positive,good film immediately read the book and wanted to see it again chalamet is helped along by a strong music score but i cant help cringing when he has to sell lines like  desert power insert epic music and epic look on chalamets face
Nov 27 2021,negative,very slow moving it was like the entire movie was building up to some big climax that never came  i actually fell asleep at one point and i never do that during movies  perhaps for someone who read the book and knows whats coming in the sequel it may have been better
Nov 27 2021,positive,this is so far from typical hollywood as you can get i am sure it is not silly or woke enough for some critics do not mind the very few negative reviews it has to be slow building as it is otherwise the epic story would feel rushed nothing is dumbed down or over explained just one heck of a deep multilayered complex story but not hard to follow should satisfy fans in casual viewers alike a cult movie and a blockbuster in one which is quite an accomplishment the casting and acting is perfect and the visuals are stunning
Nov 27 2021,positive,i read the book decades ago so dont remember if it is faithful to the book or not but i did recall some plot points it helped me remember what was going on my wife and daughter had a harder time following the plot what i didnt enjoy was the bombastic score several of us in the theater had to ask the theater to turn the volume down and the mumbling in some scenes some subtitles would be nice
Nov 27 2021,positive,utterly fantastic visually stunning 2023 can not come soon enough
Nov 27 2021,positive,great movie  amazing soundtrack  cant wait to see chapter 2
Nov 27 2021,positive,beautifully acted written and directed this is what i dream star wars could be some day
Nov 27 2021,positive,i read the books a number of times when i was younger  the material is difficult to adapt to cinema and denis v did an excellent job  i loved this movie
Nov 27 2021,positive,just loved what they did with it best description ive heard is that its like an epic prologue to what will be part 2 all the characters are introduced and the chess board is set let the battle begin
Nov 27 2021,positive,added more information than the first two movies
Nov 27 2021,positive,the cast and special effects are incredible  finding a good place to end when only covering half the first book was difficult but i much prefer splitting into two movies than try to compress everything into a single movie  the movie was fastpaced enough as it was
Nov 27 2021,positive,very well done overall great story but a little slow in the beginning but it does pick up  excited to see part two
Nov 27 2021,positive,great cinematography the director cast and crew brought the dune universe to life and it captivated me for the full 25 hours
Nov 27 2021,positive,excellent cinematography music and sound was stunning
Nov 27 2021,positive,spoiler alert as a dedicated fan of the novel i appreciate the effort that went towards adhering to it that said i was disappointed with the misuse ofmissing characters including the overdevelopment of duncan momoa was good for action decent at best for acting and that feyd rautha was somehow excluded the baron was barely involved despite the massive talent level that skarsgard brings to the table also the sound mixing was horrible i really felt for people who hadnt read the book i have bioniclevel hearing and missed at least 25 of the dialogue 
Nov 27 2021,neutral,faithful to the first cinematic offer years ago  too artsy for me  this film was able to tease with a few scenes promoting a visceral experience but they were few and far between   was i entertained  yes  but at least for me it was out novelty  so for this reason i have to admit my own age bias in expecting to compare this one with the earlier version which wasnot that great and set a campy experience  would have liked to have had the cadence and tone of prometheus or something along those lines    this movie confused me with supposedly rugged characters dressed in steampunk and postapocalyptic wear that were both just too clean for the lives the characters were meant to be experiencing   cant wait to skip the next one
Nov 27 2021,positive,a bit slow but photography and sound is amazing
Nov 27 2021,negative,i sat through over two hours of buildup so i could wait for the next movie the characters are really dull and make paying attention to the story a chore it looked pretty good but didnt have much else going for it
Nov 27 2021,positive,terrific start to an excellent story the affects are perfectly mastered into a fantastic soundtrack that enhances to story actors are spot on i wanted ryu l the story to continue and 25 hours went by a mix of game of thrones and star wars but so much larger than both
Nov 27 2021,positive,slow to develop hard to followunderstand if youre not familiar with the book
Nov 27 2021,positive,amazing movie beautiful and stunning visuals and colours and good story telling best of the best cinematography  rebecca ferguson also looks very beautiful and pretty
Nov 27 2021,positive,i liked that it followed the book more closely than the previous movie paul was younger than expected but very good the other characters were well cast also the costuming and sets were wonderful especially the desert scenes i hope they make more movies to finish at least the first book
Nov 27 2021,positive,awesome movie they did an excellent job adapting a notoriously difficult to adapt book
Nov 27 2021,positive,great cinematography and casting look forward to the sequel
Nov 27 2021,positive,all the actors were well selected for their roles the attention to details and the ability to deviate only a little from the book allows you to stay enthralled the entire time stunning cinematography
Nov 27 2021,negative,fell asleep it was so bad
Nov 27 2021,positive,sand worms thigh pads still suits nose tubes no boobs
Nov 27 2021,positive,the director and cast were all phenomenal denis us at the top of his game
Nov 27 2021,positive,good acting well paced beautiful cinematography
Nov 27 2021,positive,lots of fun  good story line  some dialog difficult to understand cinematography was well done
Nov 27 2021,positive,this version of dune is amazing denis villeneuve is a genius and master filmmaker cant wait to see part 2
Nov 27 2021,positive,really good so far excited to see part two eyes could have been more blue and contained no white at all
Nov 27 2021,positive,loved the portrayal of the characters with the awesome cast dont want to give too much away but was pleasantly surprised with the creative aircrafts location of the sets and following the storyline of the book
Nov 27 2021,positive,great visuals and music dialogue a little quiet and hard to understand sometimes
Nov 27 2021,positive,visually immersive especially if seen in imax  faithful to the novel  thankful that part 2 has been green lit  ready for it
Nov 27 2021,positive,flawless brilliant must see twice kind of movie
Nov 27 2021,positive,its good so far looking forward to see whats next
Nov 27 2021,positive,denis denis im so in love with you
Nov 27 2021,positive,excellent cinematography visually stunning fantastic character renditions cant wait for part 2
Nov 27 2021,positive,i was expecting less but this adaptation surprised me villaneuve i think nailed it the tone the music the camerawork the special effects   very good easily the best adaptation of the story thus far  i look forward to the next installment
Nov 27 2021,positive,although it showed more of the actionside of the book it absolutely captured the atmospherics and character development of the book it was intense it was excellent
Nov 26 2021,positive,part 1 was kool had a decent flow to it on the longer side as far as movies go but wasnt boring
Nov 26 2021,positive,last time i felt this good watching a part 1 of any movie was lord of the rings this was such a breath of fresh air the world seems fully realised and the people feel large then life as they should for a epic of this scale i had never heard of dune before this movie was announced so i didnt had any expectations of it but when i saw denis villeneuve was directing my expectations sky rocketed since i love his other movies namely arrival prisoners  blade runner 2047 i feel denis is on a nolanesque trajectory to being the next must see director though much of the movie was a setup for the events that are yet to unfold the intrigue was there for everything that was set be it the nature of powers that the protagonist possess or the mystery behind the antagonist which were introduced and some which are yet to be introduced the glimpse of politics surrounding the bene gesserit was nicely done  the emperor hyped up without officially introducing him the journey that paul went through in the movie was great but the future of his character teased by the event that unfolded at the end and him showcasing his ability was really hyped moment the glimpse of things to come as teased by worm riding spice use  sand power left me on the high note and ready for part 2
Nov 26 2021,positive,ive been a fan of the older dune movie from the mid or early 80s especially after reading the series of books this brought a much higher level of understanding to some parts of the movie which was unfortunately probably lost to most people unless they too had read the novels  and this current release absolutely incredible it seems almost comical to compare the special effects of one to the other but being 30ish years apart it only makes sense timothee chalamet is brilliant and is perfect for the leading role kudos to all the actors directors producers everyone but chalamet seems to have been born to play paul atreides i cannot wait for part 2 seriously im already impatient for its release
Nov 26 2021,positive,they cut out a lot of the boring stuff and kept all the action parts jason mimosa did an adequate job but we all know hes not there for his acting he didnt take his shirt off though
Nov 26 2021,positive,i really appreciate their efforts to keep true to the bookas hard as that may be
Nov 26 2021,positive,not bad was expecting a cliche remake the scenerycinematography excellent entertaining and well done
Nov 26 2021,positive,i liked dune a lot the reason i didnt give it 5 starts is because it was a little confusing ive never seen the original move or read the book so there were a few things i didnt understand completely but over all it was a really good movie
Nov 26 2021,positive,creative well acted a little choppy in some parts but what can you expect with a monster book like dune  looking forward to next one
Nov 26 2021,positive,simply stunning best cinematography and score i have enjoyed in too long
Nov 26 2021,positive,incredible the actors the cinematography the music the storyline just incedible     blown away and after reading the books i think that this is super easy to follow compared to the previous    an absolute mustsee and timothee c holy moly the best of the best
Nov 26 2021,positive,visually it is a great movie and honors the original great acting dont forget the war over space crack
Nov 26 2021,positive,i am a fan of the 1984 movies which inspired me to read the entire dune series i enjoyed this version but am a little disappointed at where they chose to end the movie the story is left unresolved and unsatisfying regardless still worth watching
Nov 26 2021,positive,beautiful film great adaptation cant wait for part 2 some minor pacing issues an odd story structure by its self but great if you keep in mind that it is really just part one of 2 in this story
Nov 26 2021,negative,dune is not a movie its half a movie promising you the other if it does well the movie equivalent of an earlyaccess game    the visuals are good the music is grand and the performances amaze but what is it in service to    two and a half hours of boring politics uninteresting characters and half a story im not left thinking wow i wonder what happens next im left thinking wow thats it    maybe when all the movies come out ill like it im not holding my breath    watch it if you like the books be cautious if you dont whatever you do dont complain about it online lest you be made fun of for being marvel brainrot
Nov 26 2021,positive,breathtaking visuals thumping soundtrack and solid editing make it a mustwatch  especially in imax 3d
Nov 26 2021,positive,the movie makes you want to read the book and cant wait until to next movie
Nov 26 2021,positive,this was the true surprise for me this year  it pretty much hit on everything i enjoy in a movie  scifi action interesting concept i bought the book about week later  about to dive into this universe loved it  
Nov 26 2021,positive,visually stunning and sets up the characters and the universe very well
Nov 26 2021,positive,nothing to complain about it his movie i really enjoyed it
Nov 26 2021,positive,beautifully directed masterful adaptation of the novel
Nov 26 2021,positive,great movie brings the book to life
Nov 26 2021,positive,great video effect but
Nov 26 2021,negative,not sure what the message was  something about the mahdi and return of some great leader   very dark and noisy  i think they were trying to show how some people attack other people for the resources and power that they possess
Nov 26 2021,neutral,very slow and poorly executed
Nov 26 2021,positive,its just a beautifully shot movie it feels like every scene has meaning and all of the actors are extremely well cast for their roles the cgi is so good in some scenes that i almost forgot it was computer generated for me this is the most immersive movie ive watched this year and i certainly hope for the promised conclusion     this is a movie i will certainly buy when released on blu ray as i suspect theres quite a bit of additional content available
Nov 26 2021,positive,brilliant accessible engaging great writing and execution
Nov 26 2021,positive,excellent movie even if you do not know anything about the story
Nov 25 2021,positive,such a good movie ive heard people say its too long or its boring but i guess they just dont understand movies like this the backstory and the political intricacies are so interesting to follow also giant sand worms how can you not love this movie
Nov 25 2021,positive,great screen adaptation of a great novel the film hits all the main points of the book and feels very true to the novel the poetic film shots get a little too much a little heavy handed but it does not distract from a great telling of a great story did i say its great
Nov 25 2021,positive,a masterpiece this movie is absolutely amazing  and denis villeneuve best movie you must watch
Nov 25 2021,positive,the imax viuals and sound were all that made it watchable on the small screen it is a poorly paced fraction of a great story the ornithopter appears to be the lead character
Nov 25 2021,positive,amazing cinematography and detail in the story
Nov 25 2021,positive,the thrill and excitement of watching dune were second to none this movie was filled with action and tense moments it can be a little confusing at times if you havent read the books but villeneuve does a wonderful job to keep you at the edge of your seat the cast was impeccable and truly showcased how great these actors are especially timothée chalamet and rebecca ferguson if you have yet to see this movie get to it
Nov 25 2021,positive,great effects true to the book
Nov 25 2021,positive,had a hunch this film was gonna be incredible boy was i right also decided to see it in imaxwow dont sit on your couch and watch this at home unless you have a massive screen and surround sound i mean dont watch it at home cause thats not supporting the movie but anyways dune was spectacular dune in imax was nothing short of perfection
Nov 25 2021,positive,a welcome relief from the book
Nov 25 2021,positive,one of the best films of 2021  a masterpiece of science fiction and drama
Nov 25 2021,positive,dune is a great adventure of a movie you start caring about the characters in a quick second it hooks you easily the story is very well told and timmy t is a great protagonist zendayas 5minute screen is also enjoyable but we couldve gotten more of her shes just so great the sound effects and the score wow 10 out of 10 this movie reminds me of the prepandemic era and how you would get excited about the movie theater great movie overall go watch it
Nov 25 2021,positive,amazing cgi and so many 5 star actors but it was a little confusing and felt like a trailer for the second movie at times
Nov 25 2021,positive,excellent show  enjoyed every minute
Nov 25 2021,positive,best loco movie of all times
Nov 25 2021,positive,dreams are messages from the deep its safe to assume that the opening message of dune relates to the visions in the mind of paul atreides director denis villeneuve has told a visually stunning sciencefiction triumph villeneuve and his team deserve awards for the creative vision in the adaption from book to screen even hans zimmer created an immersive soundtrack worth all the praise timothée chalamet as paul atreides was outstanding rebecca fergusons performance was the best i was pleasantly surprised to see the heavy worldbuilding exposition wasnt too watered down i believe the story should definitely continue and take a further dive into the depths of both arrakis and the mind of paul atreides
Nov 25 2021,positive,the movie is very faithful to the source material looks wonderful and is so strongly acted the first half of the movie keeps you enchanted and captivated unfortunately the same cannot be said about the second act where it becomes a bit overextended and has no culmination or a strong finale
Nov 25 2021,positive,this movie gave me the sensation that a was watching a new sw or lotr but this time i watched when released in theaters
Nov 25 2021,negative,i thought this movie was going to be the next star wars but instead of lots of action it fell into a mystic kind of movie basically the story never picked up for me
Nov 25 2021,positive,a visually breathtaking and audibly immersive masterpiece undoubtedly a future classic  denis villeneuve understood the assignment
Nov 25 2021,positive,why the director thought it important that the lighting of every scene had to be extremely dark interfered with us following the movies plot
Nov 25 2021,positive,very well followed the original movie story and like some of visual technical update
Nov 25 2021,positive,beautiful to watchpretty hypnotic
Nov 25 2021,negative,the movie added new characters was extremely slow and what is not true to the original movie
Nov 25 2021,positive,heavy drama supernatural hierarchy and sand  chalk another one up to a dystopian future we all know weve already begun
Nov 25 2021,positive,movie was great but really need to pay attention
Nov 25 2021,positive,liked it even better the second time great acting great pace great effects music is like one big crescendo 25 hours and i left wanting more
Nov 25 2021,positive,really well directed and true to the books adaption the shots are breathtaking given this stayed so close to frank herberts novel it was quite slow and the ending will not appease the general masses methinks
Nov 25 2021,positive,incredible best movie in a decade
Nov 25 2021,positive,dark intense and moody certainly an improvement over the david lynch directed 1984 version   cant wait to see part 2 and judge the film on its intended entirety   so far this is a must see    it is just the beginning
Nov 25 2021,positive,beautiful imagery and nicely acted  way better than the 1980s version which i tried to watch three times and only now after seeing the most recent version do i understand what was going on  still found it a little plodding though  the story was fine but it repeatedly falls into repetitive slow motion dream sequences that last for minutes and do little to propel the narrative  i know its supposed to be an epic tale but it starts to feel a bit bloated  special effects were beautiful and great set designs  the characters were a bit too mopey and introspective for my liking  if they had trimmed about twenty minutes off the run time i probably would have enjoyed it more  as is i think it fell just short of being great
Nov 24 2021,positive,this have everything a great scifi movie should have spaceships political intrigue double double backstabb jedis op ninja soldiers and tight black leather outfits   i saw this part 1 at home part 2 i will definitely see on the big screen 
Nov 24 2021,positive,dune part 1 is the newest adaptation of the 1965 scifi novel from frank herbert in attempt to redeem itself from the 1984 adaptation dune dives in with a stellar cast consisting of timothee chalamet who was a perfect cast of paul atredies rebecca ferguson oscar isaac and more the cast and their performances were spot on with the book and truly give more to their character than whats on the surface the script does a wonderful job of pertaining true to its book and the moments it skips over are unrecognizable by audience members who havent read the book the director and cinematographer do a stellar job on immersing you in the world the dune dwells in hans zimmer as always does a phenomenal job with the films score the final scene has a moment of vocals mixed with strong instrumentals that makes you want to bow down to hans work and the world you just spend 2 and a half hours in i saw this movie three times in the theater as i am a fan of the book and now the 2021 adaptation i am thoroughly excited for part 2 which releases in 2023 i highly recommend this movie to any fan of scifi but keep in mind that this isnt star wars scifi this is true scifi
Nov 24 2021,positive,ive viewed dune twice now the second occasion in imax it was an amazing experience  i got the perfect seat as well row h seat 15  right dead centre of the theatre i was at perfect eye level to catch every mesmerising shot as hans zimmers booming score reverberated around the theatre and vibrated through the floor  i had been eagerly waiting this movie for some time i read frank herberts novel roughly twelve years ago and enjoyed it and i hoped one day the right person would come to make a big screen adaptation  when i heard that finally a big budget adaptation would be made i was excited that was amplified further when news broke that the man at the helm would be denis villeneuve whos work includes sicario arrival and blade runner 2049 he also said that adapting dune was his dream project then there was the stellar cast pulled together the aforementioned zimmer placed in charge of the music score and the year long postponement following the covid 19 shut down anticipation in the weeks running up were getting bigger and bigger  but the cynic in me feared that it might disappoint as much as i have enjoyed denis villeneuves films they have had a reputation of being slow there was also the news earlier in the year were warner brothers announced it would release all new movie releases to its us streaming platform hbo max the same day as cinema releases also part two of the adaptation was not in commission in the run up to the films release which maybe was a sign the studio execs perhaps did not have the faith in it to be a smash hit or did not believe it would make the financial returns to justify a follow up  dont immediately release to platforms then more on that later  to my delight it was everything i hoped for an epic sci fi film experience that transports the viewer to another world its not just that its a visual treat it even feels real the costumes look authentic they dont look silly which is so hard to pull off in a sci fi film the spacecrafts looks real from the way they move and sound and the locations whether its the vast sand barren of arrakis or the dark and wet giedi prime home world of house harkkonen look so authentic the best compliment i could give it is that i was in a closetopacked imax theatre and absolutely everyone was fully transfixed on what they were watching and it did not feel like 2 hours and 20 minutes of your time was stolen  its a next level work of art as well with generations of filmmaking rolled in to one film you can see the evolution of sci fi cinema in the movie you can see the influence of 2001 a space odyssey star wars alien blade runner and david lynchs 1984 attempt of the same work more than that it felt like i was watching a grand era defining film that will inspire generations or at least i hope it does its up there with the best cinema experiences ive ever had up there with seeing jurassic park when i was 7 lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring when i was 13 the dark knight when i was 20 inception when i was 22but then thats when i began to feel sad  theres a melancholic feel to experiencing dune as well if youre a keen enough film buff youll know that cinema is becoming less of a magical place in recent years i dont mean the overall quality of films being released has become poorer i actually believe theres more good films being released than ever but thats for another piece its more that less movies now are being released specifically designed for the cinema experience  i wrote earlier about warner bros deciding to release the movie on hbo max the same day as the cinema release in the us they explained their decision to do that was because of uncertainty of the cinemas being opened due to the ongoing covid19 pandemic thats understandable but its just becoming more normal for movies to jump straight into release to a streaming platform a lot of people now are just happy to stay at home and watch films or bingewatch box sets on the many streaming services and sites that are easily accessible via the internet by gosh have we done lots of it in the past 18 months so instead of throwing millions at marketing and advertising a new film under its banner a film studio will now just release a new movie onto a streaming platform it makes financial sense  even marvel the box office juggernaut of the past decade is pushing more of its releases to disney sooner than expected black widow was given a premium pass release to coincide with its cinema release and shangchi legend of the ten rings is being released to the platform by the end of november and i predict that if eternals doesnt perform as strongly as hoped it will be released to disney in time for christmas then if you look the prearranged releases for marvel phase 4 youll notice theres largely more tv based projects than there are film projects a sign that even they are slowly tapping out from the cinema market  this isnt a complaint of streaming platforms i dont know what id do without netflix disney now tv etc if anything i should be praising them for helping me save money from forking dozens of pounds week after week on cinema releases but dune is proof that there is still appetite amongst movie lovers for that exhilarating big cinema experience denis villeneuve himself encouraged people to buy a ticket and experience his movie in the cinema because thats exactly why he made it he wants people to enjoy his movie in a theatre not at home on a laptop or phone screen but thats just the way its going and it really makes me feel sorry for the young cinema goers of today i do not know if theyll get their aweinspiring moments like i got with jurassic park lotr or dark knight because you dont get those feelings or reactions on small devices thats why i really really hope that there were some young film goers in that audience with me who felt those spinetingling booming moments  theres something about dune that made me feel like i was experiencing an endingthe end of big cinema well at least until part 2 is released i have that to look forward to
Nov 24 2021,positive,denis villenevues adaptation of dune is admirable for its scope ambition vision and aesthetic mastery where it falls short is the overall dull nature of its exploration the film proceeds in at an excruciatingly slow pace with most of the characters being so subdued in their characterization that it makes david lynchs overthetop characterization ten times more interesting as such dune manages to be both a decent film but so disappointing for the director who elevated blade runner to new heights
Nov 24 2021,positive,this is a slooooooow movie
Nov 24 2021,positive,it slowed down in the third act but they are trying to stretch the first book into a trilogy the art direction is great and the acting is very good the movie did not get into some of the deeper mystical or political aspects of the herbert world so we shall see definitely worth the time
Nov 24 2021,positive,fantastic adaptation  ive read the entire series thrice through seen the david lynch version a dozen times and the sfyfy channel version a few times as well  this is very well done and interesting to see the movie without all the inner monologue that is so prevalent in the books  great visuals great action great acting and great soundtrack
Nov 24 2021,positive,its kind of like fellowship of the ring in that right when you are getting into it starting to follow the plot and are starting to care about the characters the movie ends  i mean i was enjoying it but i had just started getting into it and thinking man this is a good movie when it ended  is part 2 going to debut on hbomax too  gonna try and make me go to the theater to see the second half of the movie
Nov 24 2021,positive,brave choice to split the book when part 2 hasnt been signed off on but chose a natural break point to finish part 1 far far better film then 1984 lynch attempt
Nov 24 2021,positive,dune introduces the universe criated by frank herbert in an elegant and consize way director denis villeneuve was born to tell this story and is maybe the best scifi director of our time such was proven in movies like arrival and blade runner 2049 dune  part ii please come as faster as possible
Nov 24 2021,positive,i loved it its hard for me to come up with anything negative to say about dune especially after seeing it on the big screen in imax twice there were many moments throughout the film that were absolutely breathtakingly beautiful and everything from the sand worms to the ornithopters looked very real not once could i tell if cgi was being used which is very rare nowadays on movies this size and it really helps that they filmed mostly everything on location the sound design was possibly the best i have ever heard in a film and the score by hans zimmer was perfect every single actor did a fantastic job bringing their character to life but the number one issue i can see with an average movie watcher going into dune is its slower pace and runtime i would say dune is a must see if like me you enjoy films that take their time building up the worlds characters and story instead of just jumping right into it
Nov 24 2021,positive,denis villeneuves adaptation of the unadapable frank herberts novel is definitely better and more digerible than lynchs version and yet despite the great visual style and exhiting action scenes it doesnt get to explore all the brilliance of its source material adding that the deep looks provided by timothée chalamet never does it any favors either
Nov 24 2021,neutral,ok better than the 1984 david lynch disaster with its cheesy wierding module macguffin but basically follows the same screen play a mistake    more faithful to the book with a good rendition of plot and prop devices close to what frank herbert described but they still had to go woke on a few characters to get into the oscars at least they didnt have he courage to gender swap paul and chani into a gay romance
Nov 24 2021,positive,phenomenal movie  a visual feast to the eyes
Nov 24 2021,positive,the film was a little too heavy on the epic sound effects for my taste
Nov 24 2021,positive,star wars for adults i feel i was robbed by george lucas so many years wasted i didnt know about this story very frustrating the film focuses on what matters the story and the characters the pomp and circus of other sci fi franchises wont be found here the film takes its time and it definitely is set up for the next one but when youre coming in completely blind like me you appreciate the attention to details a great experience i cant stop thinking about
Nov 24 2021,negative,there are no words to describe how horrible this movie was 1 no plot at all 2 characters were horrible 3 writing was horrible 4 pacing was horrible
Nov 24 2021,positive,visually stunning with an intriguing story im gonna go read the book now
Nov 24 2021,positive,it was good but its half a movie
Nov 24 2021,positive,it was an amazing imax experience
Nov 24 2021,positive,beautiful nuanced film the costumes cinematography acting all superb waiting for part 2
Nov 24 2021,positive,impressive worldbuilding so the movie is worth seeing as a great show of the possibilities of contemporary cinema technologies unfortunately the monumental scale crushes the actors under the weight of landscapes architecture crowds etc a somewhat plodding predictable script makes it difficult for the viewer to engage emotionally
Nov 24 2021,positive,stunning detail and more in depth of the story
Nov 24 2021,negative,visually this was beautiful and amazing as a movie its terrible nothing happens dune is a 25hr 1st act all it did was set up the story
Nov 24 2021,negative,lots of special effects but not enough to sustain my interest for 2 12 hours not enough plot and not enough character development very disappointing with such a stellar cast
Nov 24 2021,positive,add a couple points if you are a fan of the classic source material but if you expect dune to stand on its own legs as a film it fundamentally doesnt another masterclass from villeneuve in perfectly calibrated visuals and world building however you may find yourself checking your watch well before the film hits its hideously sudden ending a very dry  pun not intended  and pondering first chapter leaves an odd taste in the mouth and i couldnt help but feel it wasnt meant to be viewed this way hopefully chapter 2 eventually strengthens this uneven experience that succeeds almost entirely on the merit of its craft
Nov 24 2021,positive,cast was excellent and cinematography gorgeous looking forward to second movie
Nov 24 2021,negative,the movie was dragged out and boring  fell asleep twice  i dont know why they made this movie into 2 parts
Nov 24 2021,positive,i loved everything about this movie the cast was great the score the cinematography cant wait for part 2 
Nov 24 2021,positive,so epic there are 5 good dune books i hope more are made
Nov 24 2021,positive,the cinematography for this movie was truly epic for a movie like this to work it needs these shots to establish the scale of things enjoyed this movie thoroughly with the only critique being were they ended plus or minus 15 minutes in either direction wouldve been more desirable
Nov 24 2021,negative,this movies visuals are beautiful practically every scene has some kind of money shot that any viewer can enjoy the action scenes in the movie were good as well and were exciting to see thats pretty much the only reason this movie gets two stars the story was slow and boring theres a lot going on but at the same time nothing is happening a lot of the lines felt forced and even hard to hear due to the movies dialogue being quiet i cant see myself watching the sequels due to the pace of this movie being far too slow for me
Nov 24 2021,positive,beautiful movie great story i cant wait to see the next chapter
Nov 24 2021,positive,i still don t get it but the production values were vastly superior to the david lynch version it took me 4 or 5 viewings though
Nov 24 2021,negative,i saw this movie in a nonimax theatre and the sound was so loud that my ears hurt for hours afterwards the plot and casting were okay characters like duncan idaho and gurney halleck seemed very shallow but its hard to go deeper than that into the film when just listening to it was genuinely physically painful the volume was only tolerable when i was in the restroom next door  it was that loud it was a case of wretched sound editing ruining an otherwise passable movie
Nov 24 2021,positive,i love this movie the cast dialogue  visuals are amazing ive watched this movie 8 times now i would highly recommend
Nov 24 2021,negative,its a waste of time honestly after all the hype surrounding its release very slow and confusing just stick to the book
Nov 24 2021,positive,i absolutely loved this movie the transitions from the characters and their related backgrounds and overall character and world building was seamless  the dialogue was engaging and there was enough action background sequences and effects  to break it up to keep you engaged i dont often rewatch movies but this is one i can definitely see myself rewatching
Nov 24 2021,positive,amazing movie i wouldve loved to see this as a limited series as opposed to a full length movie with chapters the vision and storytelling tackles the source material head on which makes for a great movie 
Nov 24 2021,positive,very entertaining 
Nov 24 2021,positive,visually stunning   great acting
Nov 24 2021,positive,awesome movie sandworms wow acting terrific visually stunning cant wait for the next part
Nov 24 2021,positive,i dont normally enjoy kids movies but clearly this is a cut above the rest far greater than the star wars saga has over the past few years find a theater that has great audio and rumbles your seat you wont regret it
Nov 24 2021,positive,that is more then one movie and no idea when 2nd movie or more come out
Nov 24 2021,positive,villeneuves dune is immersive and atmospheric from the very first scene invoking the grandscale scifi cinema of old with instantclassic sophistication it remains true to the spirit of the book while avoiding many of the cumbersome trappings of space opera my one quibble is that lady jessica an assertive and powerful figure in the book despite being afraid of her son is here often reduced to something of a weepy mother stereotype hopefully her character will further develop in the sequels which promise to be epic
Nov 24 2021,negative,having not read the book it was extremely hard to figure out what was going on conversations were so convoluted and esoterical most of the time i had no idea what was being discussed  im not hard of hearing but subtitles would had been a big plus
Nov 24 2021,neutral,very slow and drawnout also several scenes are so dark you cant really see whats going on
Nov 23 2021,positive,great movie long enough to develop the story lineplot did not skimp on the graphics etc and great acting  cant wait for dune 2  it has been awhile since we have had a good trilogy
Nov 23 2021,positive,i have watched this movie 5 times now on hbo max love this director and think he did a great job putting the film together and incorporating different aspects of the book from the original film great casting great concepts and great script happy to read that part 2 has been green lit
Nov 23 2021,positive,loved everything about it
Nov 23 2021,positive,from director like denis villeneuve is you can only expect to see a beautiful cinematic experience going from the wellwritten characters and the intriguing story to the beautiful soundtrack composed by hans zimmer  this is also a mustsee one like the previous blockbusters of villeneuves work   the only negative i would give is the length of the movie which in my opinion could be a bit shortened
Nov 23 2021,positive,movie is rushed and people who dont know the whole story can easily get lost but i defiantly excited to see the next movie in this franchise lots of great actors but not used to their full potential 
Nov 23 2021,positive,the only thing i didnt appreciate was the volume level set by the theater   a lot of key dialogue was overshadowed by background musicsound effects  the movie itself was phenomenal  cant wait for part two
Nov 23 2021,positive,far more coherent than the original incredible effects set i truly want to see more
Nov 23 2021,positive,i would feel better about watching this if we were guaranteed that the second and third movie will be made where they choose to end this is essentially in the middle of the book so as a full movie it lacks climax but if they make the second half of the book plus dune messiah as villeneuve intends this will end up being the first instalment of something awesome
Nov 23 2021,positive,great movie in its own right some minor pacing issues a few things that may take a second watch to graspsink in for those unfamiliar with the duniverse and i dont think oscar isaac was the proper choice for leto but overall its a high quality visually impressive mostly faithful adaptation that lives up to most of the hype
Nov 23 2021,positive,a classic reimagined great cast great visuals and very faithful to the novel the ending is a little bit abrupt but lets hope the second part is as good as this one
Nov 23 2021,positive,i loved blade runner 2049 so i knew i was in for a treat and i was not disappointed this is a great start to such an amazing scifi epic
Nov 23 2021,positive,the photography is beautifulspectacular the sense of how large and overwhelming the space craft and buildings are is delivered wonderfully you can almost feel the massive heat and dryness and size of the desert   the story is very accurate to the book you dont have to read the book to understand what is going on of course reading the original book will help you understand the finer points of why the religious aspects of the film are so important it will also help to understand part 2 if it ever gets made of course as that is where the story gets deeper into the religion and politics of the empire  the actors are very believable and the subtle nuances in facial expressions and body language by the major lead characters was a real joy to watch for me one of the best movies i have seen in years i would definitely go see it again
Nov 23 2021,positive,what a mesmerising movie i knew nothing of dune before my first viewing but the storytelling is so masterfully done that i captured everything you have to be willing to pay attention and think but i love that everything was amazing the visuals the atmosphere the acting and the character building i was invested in all of them from the first minute i was intrigued i was scared i laughed i cried multiple times tent scene anyone that one shattered me i just felt it all the 25 hours felt like way less than that i wanted more i have seen the movie three times in theaters so far it also made me want to read the books 13 already finished currently reading book 4 god emperor of dune i cannot wait for the dvd to come out and for the next parts of course i hope denis gets to do at least up until messiah go see this
Nov 23 2021,positive,great cast great movie cant wait for the 2nd part
Nov 23 2021,positive,finally a screen adaptation of the book that stays true to it if you havent read the book you will miss a few details and some of the character back stories but its still easy to follow i like how they boiled down the political intrigue to make it easier to understand and reduce the time to fit in the screen format cant wait until part 2 comes out
Nov 23 2021,positive,excellent film adaptation i didnt want it to end
Nov 23 2021,positive,this is truly an epic film
Nov 23 2021,positive,good story line good acting but moved a little slow and was kind of dark  it held my interest enough for me to want to see the next one  it did not have the majesty of the star wars movies
Nov 23 2021,positive,when you think of great modern day directors who comes to mind christopher nolan tarantino del toro david fincher spielberg the cohen brothers etc dennis villeneuve is among the best of them all his newest film dune based off of the novel written by  frank herbert is another film that he can add to his outstanding resume i really liked dune as always villeneuve delivers a visually stunning film with outstanding sound design and fantastic acting as much as i liked dune it isnt one of my favorite films villeneuve has done it isnt on the level of blade runner 2049 or sicario but you know youre a good director when one of your more average films by his standards is still in the talks of being one the best films of the year and that is exactly what dune is it isnt perfect i have a few small issues but the pros severely outweigh the cons here is what i liked     visual effects    cinematography   sound mixing   sound design   acting   excellent storytelling   accuracy to the source material   music   standout points to rebecca ferguson lady jessica   standout points to oscar isaac duke leto   standout points to jason momoa duncan idaho    as always like all villeneuve films dune is visually stunning truly one of the nicest visual movies ive ever seen it is so interesting looking and the colors are at times dull and at other times extremely bright the cinematography is also quite impressive like always it wouldnt surprise me if dune won an oscar for visual effects or cinematography it is really that impressive the sound design is also likely to be nominated it is incredibly loud and wonderfully done and it sounds very different from other films it is so loud to the point where i felt my seat vibrating the storytelling is superb complex but it all comes together very nicely by the end the cast works flawlessly together rebecca ferguson is definitely the standout of the film for me she is excellent as lady jessica jason momoa as duncan idaho is badass and oscar isaac is great as duke leto i havent read the book but according to several people i know dune is nearly perfect in terms of accuracy to the source material the music is also incredible it is of course extremely loud and elevates suspense in already loud and intense scenes dune has a large list of pros but it is not perfect     pacing in first act   length of certain scenes    the first 45 minutes are really slow and while to my knowledge that is accurate to the book it doesnt translate all that great on screen and there are some scenes that drag a bit and feel like they couldve been trimmed down a bit   dune was very well done from the booming sound the visual scope the acting and the quality storytelling it was a bit long and the pacing in the first act is slow as can be but the movie as a whole is still really good and the small problems i have with it do not affect my liking of the movie very much i will check this one out again soon  dune grade a
Nov 23 2021,positive,the film dune was directed by denis villeneuve he made this film based on a series of books by frank herbert    previously the original dune was released in 1984 however denis villeneuve is going to revive the film in a modern way the cast is timothee shalamet as paul atreides rebecca fergusson as lady jessica atreides oscar isaac as duke leto atreides and many others including rising star zendaya as chani at the moment dune 2021 doesnt have any awards but warner brothers studious is already nominated this film for 14 academy awards    the action of the film is set in 10191 padishahimperator shaddam iv is giving into possession sand planet arrakis to leto i of the house of atreides this planet is the only source of melange or spice  a priceless substance that increase human life and provides traveling through the stars duke leto accepted dominion of the planet from there a long and interesting journey begins which doesnt intend to end so quickly paul atreides leto atreides son is preparing hard to become a fullfledged duke but the main challenge is yet to come    all aspects of this film are gorgeous the story acting soundtrack and sound design i would also like to draw attention to the operators work the style of the shot makes it immersive in the film and become part of the story the timing of the film is 155 minutes however despite this  the film is watched in one breath    i strongly recommend watching to everyone who likes and appreciates the sciencefiction films the creativity of denis villeneuve and cycles of books the chronicles of dune by frank herberts fans
Nov 23 2021,positive,its a great movie with a lot of great cg and really good action sequences the reason i gave it an 8 was because i just saw the original about two weeks before the remake and i was a bit disappointed that it wasnt as crazy as the original if not for that this movie is an easy 10 for me
Nov 23 2021,neutral,i had a very hard time paying attention to this movie even though we went to see it in imax and it has me worried about my distant plans to watch all the star trek movies i found the subject matter to be borderlineimpenetrable which is at least half my own fault we chose this movie on very short notice i didnt have a real desire or intention to dedicate my brain to learning all the jargon and character names and everything involved in what i knew to be an expansive media franchise i rewatched the harry potter movies recently and read reviews from contemporary critics saying only fans of the book would love the first movie i remember being filled with scorn  glee over that like what kind of absolute rube is not already a fan of the book but now here i am in the same spot as those hapless fellows i didnt have any specific problem with the way villeneuve presented the material to us its just that my viewing strategy was to sort of sift through the specifics and keep the plot boiled down in my mind to its bare elements but they advanced through developments so steadily that my recollection of what happened before the two characters escaped a flying ship is hazy at best things perked up a lot after that as there were only a few characters to think about and the plot became more similar to other works id seen but it was far too late for me at that point ill rewatch this when the sequel is being released
Nov 23 2021,positive,this movie has done what was said to be impossible  truly beautiful movie
Nov 23 2021,positive,incredible i hate using the term epic but nothing else quite captures it in this case
Nov 23 2021,positive,i enjoyed this movie never really got the original from the 80s i seen tonight  it was playing at the movie theater but i watched it on hbo max i wish i would have seen it in the theater
Nov 23 2021,positive,amazing the way they show politics with out shoving it up to your face and still keep it entertaining its still amazing    the vfx is so well done kudos
Nov 23 2021,positive,denis villeneuve yet again delivers a visually stunning well crafted epic along with the visceral score by hans zimmer the acting set pieces and faithfulness to the book you arent just watching a movie youre apart of one
Nov 23 2021,positive,brilliant cinematography musical score and performances by the cast  glad part ii is already greenlit see this on the biggest screen you can find
Nov 23 2021,positive,the cinemaphotography is amazing a must see
Nov 23 2021,positive,this was an incredible movie the plot was phenomenal and i loved every minute it was kinda complicated but still easy to follow definitely would watch again and im so excited for the second part to come out
Nov 23 2021,positive,the movie sets up the future parts of the series but at times it can be slow and confusing
Nov 23 2021,positive,this might be one of my favorite scifi movies yet
Nov 23 2021,neutral,dune by the numbers checks off most of the main story points like items on a grocery list and spends no time exploring any of them the trailers were more exciting it never once occurred to me going into this movie that i would find myself not caring about characters ive loved most of my life the one exception being bardems stilgar about as emotionally monochromatic as the visuals themselves a monumental waste of an opportunity in the 25 or so years i have left to me i hope that someone else makes a go of it and does it right at least i still have the books
Nov 23 2021,positive,excellent film cinematography is beautiful music is haunting and timothy challamette is wonderful worth the price of a ticket see it on the big screen for effect
Nov 23 2021,positive,dune delivers a visual extravaganza rivaled by only other films directed by denis villeneuve it kicks of this epic saga with a deep film that takes its time to set up the world characters conflicts etc the sound design as well is top notch in the film couple these things and you literally feel as if you could be on araakis yourself however the film does not perfectly execute this set up occasionally it stumbles and for some there might not be enough happening all the time however even with these flaws dune still shines and delivers a grand experience if you are a fan of science fiction this is a definite watch
Nov 23 2021,neutral,a big letdown for me didnt care about any of the characters
Nov 23 2021,negative,no where near as good as the original  whimpy hero 25 hours of nothing  waiting for the battles against spice production and the rise of moadeb and the movie is over  2 thumbs down  crap movie
Nov 23 2021,positive,visually stunning with an equally impressive and complementary score you definitely feel the need for a completion of the story i couldnt see myself sitting down to enjoy this installment alone
Nov 22 2021,positive,what shall i say first the movie was spectacular and it followed the dune canon with absolute precision the cinema photography was amazing and the acting superb i would recommend this movie to everyone
Nov 22 2021,positive,the cinematography for this film blew me away it definitely is a must see there are not many movies that i see two or three times this was one of them
Nov 22 2021,neutral,excellent casthorrible dialogue made that much more horrible because the dialogue in the book is much better superb special effects  a disappointment    disappointing that the variance from the book invariably was disappointing  removing much of the suprise the unusual which has made dune what it is and replacing it with the trite  childish
Nov 22 2021,positive,i have zero knowledge of the dune universe and this was a blind watch  i very much enjoyed the film and the scorecinematography is absolutely beautiful  looking forward to seeing what comes next
Nov 22 2021,positive,the story was very good and the acting was as well but i think that the production design could have been a little more imaginative especially for a film set in the year 100000  i would have liked to see a little more freedom with the design work i thought that the barons look was amazing but the overall design was missing the creativity that was captured so well in david lynchs previous adaptation
Nov 22 2021,positive,very true to the book and special effects were spectacular
Nov 22 2021,positive,it was an exciting movie but was a little confused
Nov 22 2021,positive,so good very nicely made movie looks beautiful on the big screen
Nov 22 2021,positive,this movie is so visually amazing the music is excellent the acting is great only a few minor complaints from me overall this movie was great and i hope to see a part 2
Nov 22 2021,positive,great visuals and music and art direction the story was told in an interesting way slow at times overall i think this is the best screen adaptation of the book made into a compelling if dark story
Nov 22 2021,positive,the photography is incredible the landscapes the story catches you right away although the development of the film feels a bit slow at times i really want to see how this franchise continues
Nov 22 2021,positive,my eyes havent been glued to the screen like this in a long time if you dont see dune in a theater you havent seen dune denis villeneuve is a master at immersion
Nov 22 2021,positive,definitely a movie you want to experience in theaters
Nov 22 2021,positive,way excessively loud
Nov 22 2021,negative,i opened an account just to review this movie so that i may warn anymore innocent consumers that may be looking to pay to see this movie dont 
Nov 22 2021,positive,i like this movie its incredible this worlds that it present this new universe its just amazing the characters are the best it feels like a quick movie you can watch with out boring
Nov 22 2021,positive,finally a dine movie the follows the book i felt like i got to see real ornathopters i enjoyed every moment of the movie
Nov 22 2021,positive,i always found the old 80s dune very hard to get into yet this new version was very easy to follow i liked the cast and the lack of any preachy woke agenda being forced on the audience that alone makes me love the film overall the special effects and use of cgi was superb i love pretty much every casting choice aside maybe the lead actor who it a little bland but that is my only complaint
Nov 22 2021,positive,i have seen it 3x twice in the theatre  the expansive and titanic nature of the world that the characters operate in is really best communicated on the big screen  cannot recommend this film enough
Nov 22 2021,positive,dune does come across as an imitation of star wars and is an excellent movie overall with an interesting story it is one of those movies that is certain to have a cult following
Nov 22 2021,positive,good but too slow pace for my taste
Nov 22 2021,positive,denis villeneuve just does not miss this movie does something that the box office has needed for a while showing it is possible to have a big blockbuster hit that is dialoguestory driven first and visual effects second visually dune is beautiful and and an absolute must see for any film fan
Nov 22 2021,positive,the movie takes you through the first half of frank herberts first book  the movie has a muted color palette and interplays between light and dark  the cinematography is a welcome return to panoramic views and long shot      the movie has a slow tempo broken up by interludes of action    i enjoyed the movie my wife struggled to stay awake
Nov 22 2021,positive,okay but was bored thru most of it till the end
Nov 22 2021,negative,dune was less than interestingi was aching to see some sort of storyline develope beyond the usual scifi fieldit was somewhat confusing and heavily protractedyawn  yawn  lee wheres my neck pillow
Nov 22 2021,positive,second time seeing it the theater  first time i took my son second time my daughter   they both loved the film equally  story telling at its finest
Nov 22 2021,negative,completely awful do not waste your time or money on this disaster
Nov 22 2021,positive,superbly directed great visuals excellent cast
Nov 22 2021,positive,as someone who had no idea of dune in the lead up i can say that the whole story line the races planets etc are all very convoluted but the story pushes through the complexity and grips you from moment 1 was a shame so little is answered at the end of the movie but it was absolutely brilliantly done and i can not wait for the next chapter
Nov 22 2021,positive,dune like looking up from abridged version of shakespeare for kids to consider its oedipal themes when you eyes fall upon a painting by van gogh and to be struck by its beauty whilst a fog horn is let off in your ear     a watchit once movie
Nov 22 2021,positive,amazing this is almost exactly what i always wanted to see in a dune movie i look forward to see the next movies
Nov 22 2021,negative,terrible boring movie 2hours of complete bullshit with bad movie graphics and effects
Nov 22 2021,positive,the production design cinematography and effects are fantastic everything else is pretty disappointing though the lead is terribly cast the second half is kind of boring drags on needlessly and has several dumb scenes its also just weird and a bit confusing if your not well aquatinted with the source material
Nov 22 2021,positive,absolutely stunning amazing film best of the year if not the last few years
Nov 22 2021,positive,slow and kind of boring the main character can tell the future so i already know what will happen in part 2
Nov 22 2021,positive,legit the best theatrical experience of my life
Nov 22 2021,negative,absolutely horrible terrible storyline and very difficult to follow we kept waiting for it to become good and it just never happened that was a waste of over two hours of my life that we can never get back i wish i could ask for my money back
Nov 22 2021,positive,overall a good movie you must go into the movie knowing there will be more to come because it doesnt answer much
Nov 22 2021,positive,the ultimate slow burn
Nov 22 2021,positive,very enjoyable i really loved the soundtrack score
Nov 22 2021,positive,i cannot be sure how much i liked it until i see the completion but it was promising
Nov 22 2021,positive,awesome better the second time around
Nov 22 2021,positive,loved it  easy to understand plot unlike there original  cast is right on target  cant wait till the next one
Nov 22 2021,positive,loved the books and this movie was an awesome start i never see movies twice but i would go again tomorrow i cant wait for the next installment
Nov 22 2021,positive,a masterpiece of modern cinema a unique work of art that deserves to be seen by everyone an act of love by the director for the book the cast is stellar and top notch the technical aspects of the film are great cant wait to see more
Nov 22 2021,positive,great acting beautiful scenery soundmusic was amazingi hadnt read the book but saw it with my son who has and he said there wasnt anything missing from the movie that detracted from me being able to enjoy it understand it definitely need to see on the big screen
Nov 22 2021,positive,its a beautiful epic done with care and art slow burn not for all but it is well made
Nov 22 2021,positive,best film ive seen in a while adaptation from books
Nov 22 2021,neutral,5710  mediocrepassable    seen on 31322
Nov 22 2021,positive,slow but packs a decent amount in its runtime and made me wanna read the book
Nov 22 2021,positive,really enjoyed it despite the fact that 90 of the movie was just talking but even that talking was interesting and its only the beginning
Nov 22 2021,positive,good special effects sound track and acting enjoyed the movie
Nov 21 2021,positive,that was an excellent rendering of the first half of the first book  i had such high expectations  and honestly  they were exceeded i only wish there had been back to back filming of part one and part two i will also be curious if they do all the books
Nov 21 2021,positive,i am a longtime dune fan and the series holds a special place in my upbringing i was very happy with what denis villeneuve pulled off here the tone pacing aesthetics dialogue were all well done i cant wait to see part 2 of book 1
Nov 21 2021,positive,beautiful visually true to the story cant wait for the next chapter
Nov 21 2021,positive,a visual feast with an impressive ensemble cast in the latest effort to do justice to frank herberts complex science fiction masterpiece well half of it on the screen delighted that the audience reaction and receipts mean that part two has been greenlit 
Nov 21 2021,positive,i didnt read the books didnt know anything about the story but it wasnt hard to follow the visuals were good but honestly i expected much more from this film the way it was hyped not bad but nothing special either
Nov 21 2021,positive,i really liked it the plot line was extremely intriguing except some part were a bit excessive the cast choice was great and you can tell it was created based off the book excited for the series
Nov 21 2021,positive,absolutely worth the wait
Nov 21 2021,positive,dune is a very tricky movie to comment on because so many things happen and at the end of the movie you want more right from the start you can see the epic scale this movie has but at the same there are certain things that are hard to follow making the movie less accessible to mainstream audiences which arent fan of the book or this genre really enjoyed it but there were some times the audience might have no idea what was going on the worldbuilding of this movie its like on avatar level or the wizarding world level fun very well directed excellent astar cast it might be timothee chalamets careerdefining movie
Nov 21 2021,positive,it is outstanding vision the great piece of art
Nov 21 2021,positive,it is as frustratingly slow as one might expect coming from its dense source material and denis villeneuves contemplative style and it cannot help but feeling incomplete as it only and consciously tells the first half of the story these flaws can be easily forgiven for dune is finally able to soar high within the scifi film genre especially thanks to hans zimmers outstanding score its fine cinematography its profound and faithful exploration of frank herberts world and the outstanding performances from its stellar cast with rebecca ferguson stealing the show
Nov 21 2021,positive,insanely well directed beautifully shot and well acted  my only gripe is wishing it had a little more personality from the lynch version sprinkled throughout had a hard time connecting to these characters but hoping that changes in part 2
Nov 21 2021,positive,closer to herberts novel than the 80s version but i felt it was a little dull at points and lacking the humour and pathos of david lynchs version which had the benefit of some incredibly gifted character actors an oddly miscast sting being one notable exception    in many ways the changes to herberts novel make even less sense in this version than those in the last where time constraints were a major factor but i guess every director feels the need to stamp their mark on their movies and the changes are generally a lot more subtle the reasons for these alterations and certain stylistic choices may be interesting i felt there was more than a little homage to the star wars movies going on in some scenes and clearly the director felt some of the themes and characters in the 1965 novel were a bit dated for audiences in 2021    an issue for some which i read about before watching the movie was the casting of sharon duncanbrewster a black british actress as liet kynes whom the book very specifically describes as a white man with sandy coloured hair going in with an open mind on the subject i didnt really understand what was added by casting duncanbrewster in the role as it isnt as if the novel has a shortage of strong female roles in the first place and there are plenty whose race is never disclosed on the other hand i felt duncanbrewster played the role well and its only a small part in the book so in some ways its not a major issue i wasnt entirely convinced the girl cast as chani kynes could plausibly be duncanbrewsters daughter less a case of race as just the massive differences in facial features build etc    race and culture are significant issues in the book in fact theyre a large part of what the book is about so in that regard some of the casting seems a little odd  unless youre looking at it through the prism of 2020 colour blindness perhaps the fremen were inspired by real desert dwelling cultures  im pretty sure the tuareg rather than the bedouin but in either case it would have made more sense to me to cast people of one of those ethnic groups in the roles it also makes little sense how small tribes of fremen isolated for hundreds of generations can still have both distinctly black and white tribal members this does have a bearing on the casting of duncanbrewster with liet kynes being the child of an imperial scientist and a freman woman in the book and his daughter chani being the child of the mixed race liet kynes and another freman woman     a couple of other things come to mind vladimir harkonnen is played with understated sinister malice rather than as the somewhat pantomime arch villain of lynchs version and even herberts novel i actually thought the understated version in the current movie fitted the highly intelligent and machiavellian nature of that character better his perverted nature largely characterised by a highly predatory and paedophilic homosexuality in herberts novel is also nonapparent perhaps a sign of the times    i wasnt sure what was going on with the sardaukar in the movie the scene where theyre first encountered is a distinctly jarring note in the movie and has no relevance to the book my septuagenarian father who watched the movie with me felt they were very imperial stormtrooper whilst i thought there was strong homage in their appearance and dress to lynchs 80s dune movie that wasnt the only apparent hark back to the 80s film for me the barons white plasticclad servants being another obvious one i felt the odd sensation as with the lord of the ringshobbit films of watching a movie in which large chunks were not so much inspired by the original books as by previous material from other sources which were not true to the original but popularly accepted as such if that makes any sense    my final issue with this movie which incidentally i did enjoy was the lack of realism in the fight scenes an issue which plagues most movies the fights described in the novel by frank herbert seem gritty brutal and real knife fights are quick bloody and deadly there are no big explosions okay there are but very very few and its a distinctly low tech environment the fight scenes in this movie are generally quite ridiculous and show a distinct lack of understanding of real violence or premodern warfare  like i said hardly unique to this particular movie the duel scenes eg paul vs jamis seem better done overall than the mass battle scenes which whilst mostly on a truly massive scale and clearly aiming to impress visually often make no logical sense at all there is one truly weird scene with synchronised atreides guards fighting in unison on some stairs which looked just like one of peter jacksons whacko battle scenes  if youve seen the movie youll know what im referring to
Nov 21 2021,positive,i didnt grow up on dune so this was new to me i enjoyed the story but only because i knew that there is a guaranteed sequel to it if this had been it i wouldve been upset with how slow and uneventful it was but glad they are able to take their time knowing a sequel is promised to unfold the story
Nov 21 2021,positive,a real great experience watching it on the big screen ive read the books and seen the 1980s version the director did a great job looking forward to the next one 
Nov 21 2021,positive,it was absolutely everything i hoped for and more absolutely brilliant  the acting sets cinematography really brought the film together i cant wait for the next film because its the best part of the book
Nov 21 2021,positive,if you get overwhelmed with all the names of all the people and places at the beginning of this movie dont worry it comes together beautifully by the end i didnt like the book but this is a story about ruthless capitalism and the battle between good and evil its cool to look at and the acting is very good it didnt feel close to being 2 12 hours long
Nov 21 2021,positive,a lot of moneyspent on this confusing film
Nov 21 2021,positive,loved it and cant wait for the next instalment i read the book as a teen and the movie definitely lived up to it
Nov 21 2021,positive,compared to pretty much any other blockbuster movie youll see dune has significantly less action and many silent moments and yet it keeps you entertained for 2 hours and a half due to an excellent performance by the cast the use of the soundtrack the scenery and the careful introduction of the new story elements  it left me as if something was missing i dont feel particularly invested or curious about any of the characters the story or the cultures it felt more like an introduction to the main story almost a prologue but it is a beautifully crafted movie i recommend watching it on the big screen to get the best of the experience
Nov 21 2021,negative,a bit meh  special effects were phenomenal but story was lacking
Nov 21 2021,positive,beautiful shots and powerful visuals really help to make this scifi epic into the truly magnificent cinematic treat it is
Nov 21 2021,positive,it is so beautiful and visually stunning it is wonderful to look at and only film can be so overwhelming
Nov 21 2021,positive,good building on the drama   stayed fairly close to the book
Nov 21 2021,positive,visually a gorgeous movie and was just a great story
Nov 21 2021,positive,a great adaptation to the legendary masterpiece that pays the right amount of attention to the defining details in the book
Nov 21 2021,negative,thus movie not for me left half way through
Nov 21 2021,negative,as dull as the desert
Nov 21 2021,positive,i expected nothing from this nor have i seen the original movie being such a long movie my assumption had been it would be more about style than substance i was bowled over by the cinematography and film score but the story writing and acting were what really impressed the pace tone and style work really well in line with great character and story development at no point did it feel too long or protracted i was engaged captivated and immersed from start to finish i only hope the second instalment is as good
Nov 21 2021,positive,having read the book as a teenager and seen the 1980s version of the movie i found this to be the improvement in story telling that the book deserved  it moved quite well when you consider the length of the book and how you could possibly fit all that detail into a feature length film that doesnt need multiple intermissions for bathroom and snack breaks  knowing the story it moved along quickly enough that i didnt find myself looking at the time to see how long id been sitting or how much longer it could possibly be till the end  i can only hope this installment performs well enough that part 2 actually gets made as i want to see the full story get told through this vision of the film
Nov 21 2021,positive,dune really deserves a 5 season series to tell the novel with justice to the material thats 50 hours of content  what this film was was a highlights film of the first half of the book with some creative elements to fit the pieces together  frankly i was mesmerized because it was visually stunning the characters done well and select highlights captured with phenomenal moving cinematography and execution  there were tears welling at times  like blade runner 2049 the film was nothing short of stunning  disappointing in that it was a highlights film of material deserving so much more than highlights  yet after br 2049 i was expecting great things from villeneuve and was not disappointed
Nov 21 2021,positive,a detailed and imaginative world i like the casting the story is a bit ponderous just a little to into itself and though dune preceded the star wars phenomenon this film feels a bit derivative despite its imaginativeness
Nov 21 2021,negative,too slow not enough happened this is a part 1 of 3 which was not disclosed when we bought the tickets  good story and graphics but it needed more to it this was like a teaser to a trilogy
Nov 21 2021,positive,i wasnt disappointed there where some scenes missing that where in the first two which i would have like to have seen in this iterationhelp flesh out the history behind what is going on the acting was certainly superior
Nov 21 2021,positive,amazing  cinematography music acting true to source material  it honestly could not be any better
Nov 21 2021,positive,epic science fiction at its finest
Nov 21 2021,positive,a bit of a slow burn but it had me glued to the screen for the entire running time the visuals were amazing but never overbearing or tiresome the action sequences served the story and never felt like they were just trying to be eye candy though they were still gorgeous      i want to watch it again
Nov 21 2021,positive,a gem always wanted an iconic film based on this iconic book not to mention this is a visual masterpiece the only thing that aches for me is the acting tims acting is bad he acts incoherently basic while in the book paul was supposed to be a 15yr old intimidating genius leader of some sort also zendaya acting feels the same as any of her other roles plain and flavourless felt like i was watching mj again
Nov 21 2021,positive,visually stunning and expertly scored i wish the theater sound wasnt so loud though
Nov 21 2021,negative,yikes what the hell did my brother and i just watch it was awful and quite boring half the time it was 2 hours and 30 minutes way too long which didnt need to be none of the characters made an impact for us to care for them not that the actors were bad in general we like many of the actors in this movie but the storytelling was a mess and confusing my goodness we were so confused for most of the time that we still dont know what the point was of the movie and the way it ended sucked the fact it has a high score with critics and the audience baffles me were just glad we saw this crap at home on hbo max and we were relieved when it ended if we saw this in theaters we would have wanted our money back or use that money to go see eternals again now that film was beautiful and incredible allaround  loved it we wont be watching the second part to dune when it comes out no thanks by the way tell me not that the dune sandworms face looks like a butthole lol
Nov 21 2021,positive,saw it at the alamo theater and enjoyed it a lot i think it did great service to the original graphically i thought it was stunning just wish they had started on the second part already  instead of it having to be approved cast wise i think it was solid one thing that you never get to see do is how their civilization lived at their home world but that apart i thought it was a excellent movie glad i saw it at the theater i will be adding this one to my collection in the future
Nov 21 2021,neutral,the only way they can fuck this up is if they make at least fivehundred or more subplots that dont go anywhere except out my ass    well guys i was right this movie wasnt the worst but it wasnt great either disappointed
Nov 21 2021,positive,this movie was the right story at the right time the whole movie flowed and was a pleasure to sit back and enjoy the visuals and epic sounds and music i enjoyed the original series and this was a great upgrade and cant wait for the next steps in the series
Nov 21 2021,negative,there were like 10 different subplots lots of action but it was hard to follow along and see where this was going the ending sucked
Nov 21 2021,positive,a little slow moving
Nov 21 2021,positive,best movie ever all agesfabulous cinematography script acting direction
Nov 21 2021,positive,slow start but absolutely worth it every moment felt important and the visuals were awesome
Nov 21 2021,positive,it is the new star wars movies the plot is not there
Nov 21 2021,positive,a great job following book
Nov 21 2021,positive,great effects good story great characters mildly hard to follow because the actors talk too softly to understand in several scenes
Nov 21 2021,negative,too bad they gave us a 2 12 hour trailer for the coming dune franchise should have seen that coming when they came up with that trendy cast i imagine that someone with talent like peter jackson could of given us a great and complete movie dont waste your time watching this movie now wait for the next instalment and watch them together you wont miss much
Nov 21 2021,positive,visually it is stunning and sometimes breathtaking but its very solemn and sedate and without time for the characters to breathe its hard to invest in
Nov 21 2021,negative,too slow  needed some humor    30 minutes of commercials before a 2  12 hour movie was excessive
Nov 21 2021,positive,beautiful cinematography and visual design excellent music score a little slow paced could have cut out 30 min but fantastic writing and a great introduction to the universe you get eased into it
Nov 21 2021,positive,dune is a movie with just great visuals production design and music it feels like the movie is large in scale and takes very good advantage of the good performances from the cast however although the world it presents is interesting having a too slow pace excessive character development and a very slow plot makes the film confusing and can become boring therefore it is a film that captivates for its visual aspect but that in its history could have been better executed
Nov 21 2021,positive,i loved the cinematography and the music for the acting it was good for the mist part
Nov 21 2021,positive,way better than i expected a relief from a really bad year of film
Nov 21 2021,positive,exceeded expectations the sound and music shook you to the core eagerly awaiting part 2
Nov 21 2021,positive,what an amazing and epic storyneed to watch it again
Nov 20 2021,negative,unwatchable an attack to dull the senses and put you to sleep
Nov 20 2021,positive,loved the movie look forward to the next installment of dune  the new reclining seats were great along with the swing out tablearm  my only complaint was that the sound was very loud and thats from someone who is hard of hearing
Nov 20 2021,negative,way way wayyyyy to slow the book wasnt even this slow im kidding but its a movie you can speed things up a bit otherwise make it into a miniseries
Nov 20 2021,negative,i so much wanted to love this movie was a huge fan of dune as a kid read it several times and even didnt hate the 1980s movie but this movie is just boring it has no spark no drama its grey lifeless and plodding and takes itself way too seriously    the drama of the movie is hamstrung by the lack of any detectable musical score im sure it exists but while i was watching i didnt notice it maybe thats the new normal for films where they are scored to sound like tv shows but it drains all of the impact of the story and leaves the film feeling like a boring documentary    and like the phantom menace we see a world of cg effects devoid of life and activity the city of arakeen is an obviously cg rendered cement factory the citizens of dune could fit in a small conference room apparently and none of them look like the inhabitant of an alien future they look like they came from a star trek tng episode
Nov 20 2021,positive,true to the story special affects
Nov 20 2021,positive,it did start off a bit slow but it does do a nice job of bringing you into this complex universe that theyve created the cast did an excellent job of delivering the narrative but the ending did somewhat let me down as were expecting this big payoff in the end only to realize that this is only part 1 and now we really need the second part to see the completion of this story 
Nov 20 2021,positive,i left feeling confused  at times it was too hard to understand what was being said i do think the performances were good but this wasnt for me
Nov 20 2021,positive,it was really great  i had taped the original and watched it that night  the remake went into much more detail  looking forward to part ii
Nov 20 2021,positive,its a setup and a promise for part ii when the hopedfor action and romance should take place part i was hard to follow impossible if you hadnt read the book i watched with one fan of the novel and one who had never read it the bene gesserit sisterhood is so crucial to the story and that was barely explored lady jessica was a bore and she should have been riveting im disappointed especially as i loved villeneuves previous film blade runner 2049 but i will be back for part ii
Nov 20 2021,negative,in a nutshell it is a pretty  but empty movie  you could cut an hour off and you still wouldnt miss anything story wise  come to think of it  what is the story    and then you have the overbearing soundtrack shallow character development  the only rememberable character was harkonen the rest was just meh    cinematography was okay and the worms looked cool  but the rest was just boring  even dunes force powers were just moronic  yes i get that if youre a fan of the books it might have made more sense but as i havent suffered from that affliction  some scrawny kid putting his hand in a box while some old hag holds a magic marker against his throat meant nothing  and that is the movie in a nutshell weird unexplained things happening that dont get resolved nor do they matter    if you want cool 70s based scifi just watch the original starwars again better story on the account it has one   if you want great cinematography in the dessert then just watch david leans lawrence of arabia    but please dont make the mistake to think that dune comes even close to either of them in their genre  this is just an empty soulless movie and only for people who realllllyyyyy  love dune  this is not a new lord of the ringsits not smart  just long and dull
Nov 20 2021,positive,did an excellent job in bringing the book to life  i hope theyll finish the first book by filming part two
Nov 20 2021,positive,i dont have much to stay about the film other than the fact that it was okay but was entertaining to watch because of the commentary my friends and i included along the way    i dont know if theres tv trope for futuristic fantasy with middleages elements but thats what this film is they had bag pipes and ancient customs combined with spaceships we cant even imagine    not the type of movie id particularly recommend to anyone else
Nov 20 2021,positive,stunning in every sense of the word the casting is a the effects and design are incredible and you are hurting your constitution if you do not see this film
Nov 20 2021,positive,visually beautiful and a nice version  but i dont think it deserves all the hype its getting
Nov 20 2021,positive,solid adaptation of a classic novel it may not be a line by line translation but it hits all the right notes from the book well worth the trip into a strange new world
Nov 20 2021,positive,oh my a new film that loves and respects its source material a currentera film that is uncontaminated by the cancer of wokeness one that doesnt simply steal a familiar name to spout a new flavour of activist garbage denis does it again  with this and 2049 im beginning to think hes the only trustworthy director in the film industry thank you so much for making a wonderful film that lives up to a wonderful book this film is a triumph
Nov 20 2021,positive,its the best film ive seen in the cinema in 11 years    15 years ago it would have been an average ok film now it stands out for not being awful     very pretty and decent characters theres one genderswap with a main character which as always makes no sense is jarring and spoils about half the film but otherwise its relatively free of north american race and gender political activism
Nov 20 2021,positive,am excellent epic movie i was able to follow the plot even though i had not read the book
Nov 20 2021,positive,this movie is everything it makes me imagine again and again the direction casting writing and cgivfx it is a movie that must be experience in the theaters
Nov 20 2021,positive,in comparison to the original it was difficult to grasp maybe i should have watched it as a new movie then i wouldnt be so judgmental
Nov 20 2021,positive,the movie has great performances when i think back on the movie i cant think of one thing i didnt enjoy about it
Nov 20 2021,positive,i remember the story as complicated but this version is easy to follow and visually stunning  looking forward to seeing the rest of the story
Nov 20 2021,positive,dune is the excellent scifi sample on period i havent read and watch any movie and book about dune and this was my first impression about the dune universe and i already liking it i liking it about the visual aspect of dune the excellent sound design and the excellent execution on confusing dune universe that make me further invested
Nov 20 2021,positive,great visuals good writing and good acting this is the dune movie we have been waiting for
Nov 20 2021,positive,plot scenery acting could not understand some if the script whispers or myffled but could follow the plot
Nov 20 2021,negative,horrible movie  no plot  too many story lines that never developed
Nov 20 2021,positive,a scfi opera of mythical proportions visually stunning with a wonderful sense of realism part one is just scratching the surface of the stories that can be told in future acts
Nov 20 2021,positive,excellent cinematography  so well filmed music sound quality  made for the movie theatre
Nov 20 2021,positive,had some slow parts but looking forward to seeing part 2
Nov 20 2021,positive,it was a good cineamatic portrayl of part of the novel  the scenes for the most part gave you the feeling that you thought a film portrayal of the scences would  should give the viewer not at all dscordant but without being slavish to the book the casting was generally on point and the acting was uniformly good incluing timothy chaulmlet although he seemed rather slight to be paul atreides not quite substantial enough to be winning his sword fights even though he is supposed to teenager at time
Nov 20 2021,positive,all good   acting effects scenery music  not so good  several times it was difficult to understand the dialog the english dialog the one we were supposed to understand  not sure if it was fast talking garbled or drowned out by other noises but it wasnt bad enough to ruin the movie by any means
Nov 20 2021,negative,destroyed another remake terrible movie bad actors terrible story line that they changed put a little weakling of a actor use actor looselyto play paul donot waste your money what the old dune from 1984 that movie is great  also they are going to have to make a another terrible movie because this dune is bad the sequel is going to be even more terrible dont bother
Nov 20 2021,neutral,not my kind of movie visual effects were good
Nov 20 2021,positive,for one dune i believe takes a special kind of person to love but will be liked by everyone for scifi fans already intimately familiar with picking up tidbits of lore and worldbuilding dune 2021 will be a film that keeps you constantly fascinated and intrigued by the amount of politics tech and mythology thats sprinkled throughout the film whether it be the houses the dragonfly aircraft or the treatment of the sandworms fans of intensely captivating backgrounds have a lot to enjoy    for those unfamiliar with herberts work the beginning admittedly starts off very slow a necessary caveat to introduce many moviegoers to the world of dune despite this by the second act the plot picks up and you are instantly thrust into the immersive and thrilling storyline     the plot though honestly a bit antiquated in many ways such as the clear jesus archetype of paul and a bit confusing is very much as close as you could get to a modern adaptation of the eponymous novel in cinema it still holds up today an incredibly exciting and intense conflict between the house of atreides and all of the other independent factions    notably i found timothée chalamet and oscar isaacs portrayals of their respective characters provided some life to the characters and their struggles the ensemble though the striking lack of zendaya was upsetting provided for characters that you could love understand and root for for example im happy they emphasized the relationship between the dukes son and his fathers righthand man duncan played by jason momoa there was so much love and emotions between the two    of course any review of dune would be amiss to not mention the animation and cgi clearly jumping off of the work done in the 1984 adaptation which to be fair for its time was quite revolutionary led to a film that even despite its budget which was even less than marvels black widow had incredible graphics and cinematography all of the cgi whether the simple energy field of the shields the remarkably vibrant sunken sand or the dragonfly aircraft which i am mentioning again because of how awesome it was truly added to the scifi world honestly im just happy for a film that rejects many of the traditional science fiction elements overdone in the genre eg anything in star wars     yet i have to talk about what i consider to be the crowning aspect of the film the cinematography its literally a movie called dune that 99 takes place in a barren desert full of sand its a miracle that the filmmakers made it look beautiful both the wide shots of the distinctive dune landscapes or the closeup shots provided for a movie that can be easily appreciated for not only the wonderous immersive world but also intimate to the characters    in short dune is a movie easily adored by geeks in its genre but also can be appreciated by the more traditional blockbuster watcher the lore intense and engaging plot characters and beautiful animation and cinematography provide for a wonderfully enjoyable film with its watchers clamoring for the sequel
Nov 20 2021,positive,went straight home watched it again on hbomax
Nov 20 2021,positive,if you go in knowing its just a portion of the book you will enjoy it wellcast with beautiful alien worlds
Nov 20 2021,positive,fantastic movie but it needs closed captions you could not understand what they were saying half the time
Nov 20 2021,positive,jesus h christ this is how you make a movie
Nov 20 2021,positive,amazing   a better version of the 1980s original  you already know the story  what is surprising is how stunning the visuals are  artistic   like a kubrick movie   this is fantastic sci fi done by a director who cares more about art than making a commercial success  not a movie made by a committee and screened and refined by a test audience  bravo  worth seeing in the theatrestwice
Nov 20 2021,positive,i am a true dune fan and read the book over 30 years ago  this movie is a fantastic rendition of the story  frank herbert would be happy with it  great job
Nov 20 2021,negative,it was great actor wise and aesthetic wise but dang there was no action for like the whole movie
Nov 20 2021,positive,amazing cinematography was very impressed by this version of one of my favorite scifi books of all time i cant wait to see more
Nov 20 2021,positive,my only complaint is where they divided the movie in to to at i would have cut a bit less and ended sooner but once part 2 is out they may prove me wrong  excellent film as is though and best of the 3 adaptations
Nov 20 2021,positive,its another amazing movie by denis villenueve with a masterful cinematography and great acting
Nov 20 2021,positive,its good but they could have cut out at least 45 minutes of sand and sky that said it is a disney movie antidote there are whole stretches of silence and emoting without continuous peppy chatter or jump cuts the villains are mysterious rather than clear cut and the taking of lives is never slick and easy when the battle scenes come they are atmospheric rather than in your face the critical look at our worlds many failing systems underlies the narrative but does not dominate the storytelling best of all the female characters are there from the start and hold their own  bonus for a very cute desert mouse and the best aerial scenes since top gun
Nov 20 2021,positive,very well done could have been more detailed to match the books looking forward to the next one
Nov 19 2021,positive,true to the book well acted characters developed  perfect setup for the second movie
Nov 19 2021,positive,a 25 hour movie that feels barely over an hour is how you know a film has fantastic pacing as an avid fan of frank herberts dune universe i was extremely pleased with this on screen adaptation however certain concepts and happenings may be lost on people who have never read the book 100 recommended a watch either way
Nov 19 2021,positive,visually stunning follows the original book closely
Nov 19 2021,positive,good cgi and score in imax
Nov 19 2021,positive,it is a very good redo of the original  however i didnt like the fact that we were not informed ahead of time that it was only part 1   when is part 2   there was no info anywhere about that
Nov 19 2021,positive,i have been a huge fan of the books for many years and am so happy to see such an excellent adaptation finally brought to the screen this was my first return to theaters in almost 2 years but i really felt it was worth it it was so good i a went home and signed up for hbo max so i could watch it again   denis villenueve was an excellent choice for director the cast were all excellent and well suited to their roles the world of dune felt very real and impressive the bene gesserit so good i didnt love the way it cut off at the end but i didnt hate it either very excited for part two
Nov 19 2021,positive,enjoy it as much as the first one
Nov 19 2021,positive,i found it very enjoyable best adaptation so far leaps and bounds above the original movie and the mini series
Nov 19 2021,positive,brilliantfilm making story characters actors  go see itin the theater
Nov 19 2021,positive,a nearperfect adaptation of frank herberts masterpiece cant wait to see the other parts
Nov 19 2021,positive,visually and aurally stunning much more coherent than david lynchs truncated version the source material is still unwieldy at times but this might be the best that can be done with it ending is a little unsatisfying as this is only part i
Nov 19 2021,positive,beautiful lengthy movie filled with cinematics that i feel are totally worth seeing the story depicted in this movie are a much better version of the original to boot
Nov 19 2021,negative,quite possibly the most boring film of the last 18 months
Nov 19 2021,positive,awesome movie i am fan of the book so i am not please by everything but in overall it is a great adaptation
Nov 19 2021,negative,it was not what i expected nor do i see it getting to the levels of star war it  lacked background and the hysterical crying was just annoying
Nov 19 2021,positive,no color  dark and foreboding throughout i was glad to get back out to fresh air and my world welldone but depressing ive had enough of that given the constant covid scare
Nov 19 2021,positive,i liked the original but thought this was even better
Nov 19 2021,positive,very cool looking movie that is very slow paced  it has quite the cast and worth your time if you are into slow moving scififantasy films
Nov 19 2021,negative,expecting so much and was delivered in part feel there was snatches of the epic dune should be but was self indulgent as the director didnt tell the story the dream sequences far from adding just offered confusion to the person who had not read the book
Nov 19 2021,negative,so disappointed in this movie could have been epic but it took forever to do nothing they only made half a movie the acting and visuals were amazing however
Nov 19 2021,negative,its beautiful and creates atmosphere but it is just so boring for me i imagine herbert fans will enjoy it but its just too dense for me
Nov 19 2021,positive,the additional 5 stars is for jason momoa
Nov 19 2021,positive,follows the story line from the book  special effects where great
Nov 19 2021,positive,masterpiece as a book fan i couldnt be happier this is how you do an adaptation as a cinema fan bravo one for the history books stunning visuals excellent and fittingly alien score i couldnt be more thrilled i cant wait to see it again
Nov 19 2021,positive,dune is an operatic picture with beautiful story amazing performances and dutiful writing comes a slow burn scifi epic thatll leave you wanting more
Nov 19 2021,positive,maybe not for everyone but i really like the slower world builging pace of this movie  gives you time to immerse yourself in its world  so many new movies nowadays move too fast marveldc for example that i actually get bored with which is counter intuitive but they are all kind of the same to me the cinematographycgi and sounds are top notch in this movie is why i watched in the theater after initially watching it at home  cant wait for the sequel which it sounds like will happening but who knows
Nov 19 2021,positive,a science fiction fan i havent been so mesmerized in a theater in a very long time dunemovie deserves to be experienced on imax screen a cinematic event with an engaging story spectacular effects and truly allstar cast realchalamet is officially a movie star dunemovie
Nov 19 2021,positive,loved it when i heard the sequel will not be out till   2023 i was very sad
Nov 19 2021,positive,very accurate to the book with only a few adaptations the cinematography was excellent the music added to the story this was a well made movie
Nov 19 2021,positive,amazing better than the first one
Nov 19 2021,positive,dune was an excellently crafted film it stays true to many key parts of the novel while still adapting and changing the pacing to make the story more bearable as a movie the performances from oscar isaac and rebecca ferfuson were very satisfactory the best part of the movie was the set design and overall cinematography beautifully shot as all of dvs films are    55 would recommend this film to any and all fans of science fiction or political thriller
Nov 19 2021,positive,it was way long for a weird storyline
Nov 19 2021,positive,the movie was slow paced but beautiful the problem was there was nothing to look at or someone to root for i sat 2 hours waiting for an oomph factor but movie didnt gave much maybe second part would have something in it and ill take this movie as a setup but 2hrs just for a setup
Nov 19 2021,neutral,good movie but there was no context  confusing
Nov 19 2021,positive,ive never read a dune book or watched it the series i think it was  but man this was a great movie all around and well im hooked      what a great movie  has to be the best movie ive seen in years  that might not be saying much but happy either way  1010  dont f up the sequel    btw created a rt account just to write this review
Nov 19 2021,positive,best adaptation of dune ever
Nov 19 2021,positive,an incredible masterpiece  this is not only the best film of 2021 i would say its the best film since the lord of the rings saga was released
Nov 19 2021,negative,im not as enamored with this as others seem to be  i felt like i was dropped into a world i was expected to not only understand completely from the start but also already be invested in but without much world building it just felt like a slow mess to me  maybe if i had read the source material it would be a different experience but without that i can only appreciate the well done visuals and acting  i dont plan to watch future installments
Nov 18 2021,neutral,everything was good about it except that it sets everything up and then nothing happens this was no resolution or completion of this story its obviously just a setup for the next one and if thats the case it should have just been a tv show let film die and make way for a superior medium
Nov 18 2021,positive,good cgi cinematography and editing the only thing that leaves something to be desired is the soundtrack which is not at all exciting
Nov 18 2021,negative,as a reader of frank herbert and a viewer of the prior films had i not known herbert i would be clueless about the significance of the spice melange ignorant of the function of the spacing guild and navigators the benegesseret etcetc
Nov 18 2021,positive,you would think that after the first star trek movie hollywood might think twice about dragging out a film with artsy slow panning  music  i guess not  unsatisfying  cant touch the 1984 version which is still the best
Nov 18 2021,positive,very entertaining with amazing imagery  very artistic and just fun to watch
Nov 18 2021,negative,i cant describe what an absolute disaster of a film it is its convoluted messy damb annoying and worst of all boring the charecters were so one note that its hurt the score was literally like nails in my ears the effects were preety good and so is the acting  overall a 3510
Nov 18 2021,positive,sure it was the theater but darn it was loud our ears are still ringing   hope its not three years waiting on the continuations followed herberts book much closer than the other movies series
Nov 18 2021,positive,it was pretty good i would have to say not better than the original but still pretty good 
Nov 18 2021,positive,a beautiful film visually but also a great film with its message
Nov 18 2021,positive,it wasnt for me but my wife did enjoy it
Nov 18 2021,positive,i love the movie was slightly upset that it was only half of it but i will gladly wait for the other half of this amazing adaptation of dune
Nov 18 2021,positive,i disliked the aliens just like the characters in the movie so relatable
Nov 18 2021,positive,dune is a world that has been on my radar for years now but i never delved deep into it mostly because i wanted to read the book first whenever that time comes when denis villeneuve one of my favourite contemporary directors took the reigns of a new adaptation of it and it finally got released recently i knew it was time the scifi story without going into details and spoiler territory is set in a possible future many 1000s of years from now and is centred around house atreides one of several great houses and the son of the duke as they are tasked by the emperor to take charge of the desert planet arrakis where a crucial and rare mineral is extracted in place of another house things dont go as planned when they get there     this is one of those rare occasions where i have read the source material and i was ecstatic to check out this film to see how that world is brought to the screen with the help of modern technology to no surprise for me knowing denis previous filmography the film is an audiovisual treat i do hate the fact that i didnt have the luxury to check this out in cinemas let alone imax still watching it at home on my average home theater i was enthralled by how the universe created by frank herbert was brought onto the screen in a sublime seamless fashion whether it is shots of landscapes cityscapes planets massive futuristic vehicles the sandworms indoor spaces all of it looked wonderful with topnotch cgi the imagination at display from the source material was aweinspiring and the love for it was shown in taking the time to let the visuals breathe instead of haphazardly throwing in stuff and rushing to the finish line the word epic does get thrown around a lot but this is one of the few occasions where it aptly fits and then some    accompanying the visuals are the toptier sound effects that can give you an eargasm and a fittingly strong score by hans zimmer sure you do get the usual buwaaams but on a whole i enjoyed the uniquenessfreshness of zimmer on this one from his norm kinda liked how it felt for interstellar although not as amazing     there are a lot of characters and the casting for many of them was really good i loved oscar isaac as duke leto he fits that persona so well and i so wish there was more of him rebecca furgeson as lady jessica was awesome and had one of the best performances in the film stellan skarsgard as the baron harkonnen was a stroke of genius so imposing and effective with the accompanying visuals havier bardem as stilgar was friggin amazing and i cant wait to see more of him in part two timothee chalamet as the protagonist paul atreides was another strong one although when compared to veteran actors he did stumble here and there but also had some great moments plenty of wellcasted actors for characters from the book     unfortunately even with the 2 and a half hour runtime characterization was weak so many characters didnt have enough screentime to be fleshed out properly and some got completely shafted for example piter de vries some story beats also suffered still some of the writing was commendable that even with a lot of material to adapt most of it went through quite well even if i was wishing they made the movie a full 3 hours long the omissions made and sacrifices for the dialogue wouldnt have been an issue then     now it is not apparent from the promotional material but this is part one of the experience that roughly covers 55 of the book so keep that in mind as the film just sorta ends without any satisfying conclusion im so glad that part two has been announced so now we wait for that its gonna be excruciating     overall despite some issues i loved it its a faithful adaptation from someone who genuinely cared for it a grandscale epic serious scifi adventure that you dont really get anymore its probably the best audiovisual treat ive gotten since denis villeneuves last scifi outing ie blade runner 2049 absolutely love that film just goes to show how modern visual effects can be implemented in the hands of someone who knows what theyre doing whether youve read the book or are new to this world id highly recommend checking it out and if i were to rate it id give it an 810
Nov 18 2021,positive,beautiful music and visual imagery cant wait for part 2
Nov 18 2021,positive,visually stunning but the movie consists of a slow and gradual rising action with seemingly no climax or resolution it felt incomplete but very interesting
Nov 18 2021,positive,left you guessing a bit too much about how it ends
Nov 18 2021,positive,i have waited my whole life for this film adaptation it is so so incredible set design casting acting practical effects cinematography sound music every single thing was done to absolute excellence best movie ive seen in years by a huge margin if you havent seen this film you are truly missing out    note every negative review ive read on here essentially boils down to i need more boom i need my hand held through the plot how dare they make a part one cram three books into one movie i have a sad because this movie is smarter than me people if you hate scifi dont care about the dune story or cant be entertained without constant boom dont rate this movie 1 star just dont watch it okay
Nov 18 2021,positive,epic  the scale and grandeur of it all makes the story the characters support it and a lot is missed from the book but if thats what you want go read the book if you want to see this story on film here it is
Nov 18 2021,positive,disappointed that it wasnt a complete movie but just the first part of a franchise  dont know whether ill return for next parts
Nov 18 2021,positive,great movie i didnt realize this saga was made in parts thats good as i was wondering how all the info would be played out in a shorter flick i loved the original as a kid and i must say the director did a phenomenal job kinda wish sting was in this one too   great cast selectioni love the diversity
Nov 18 2021,positive,dune is the remake by dennis villenuve based on the science fiction book of 1965 by frank herbert the film does not tell the full story setting up future sequels which means this film is mostly set up that hurts the movie a bit as it features a very slow pace and not as much action yet villenueve creates some of the best cinema in recent memory the cinematography is incredible with beautiful locales featuring mountains grass and no pun intended dunes of sand that transport us to this universe the world feels grounded in reality and is epic to behold on the big screen timotee chalamet who continues to grow and mesmerize as an actor does a good job here playing a young prince who is destined for greatness yet there is still much left to be desired and well see how he handles himself when the sequels come about the strongest roles here are those of rebeca ferguson and oscar isaac as a couple and parents of timotees chalamet they dont always have great chemistry but as veteran actors there able to pull off raw performances with great emotion and tenacity this movie however is mostly the lore and visuals is clear this movie inspired star wars and many modern science fiction movies but since star wars is now embedded in our cultural psyche is hard to watch this movie without falsely thinking is ripping off george lucas space opera even though is the other way aroundeven though is frustrating that it left a lot hanging the movie is filmed incredibly setting up what will hopefully be an incredible sequel
Nov 18 2021,positive,amazing sound and visuals
Nov 18 2021,positive,nice  movie look forward t o the 2nd part
Nov 18 2021,positive,most of the time i run when i hear epic and see a runtime of almost 3 hours but being a fan of the dune story i had to see this one not only is it engaging and entertaining the whole time it is very well shot and some of the best sound in a film that i can remember villenueve has clearly learned from arrival also great and blade runner 2049 not so great and you will notice some similarities especially the sound effects and score but dune has topped them both                                                       dune was described to me as if matrix and star wars had a child and then that child got pregnant as a teenager by game of thrones and then their child was then adopted and raised by tron and bladerunner with robocop as a close relative summed up the vibe of the movie very well i thought lol
Nov 18 2021,positive,i have watched this film twice now it was awe inspiring and terrifying on first view and heartbreaking on the second to me it is an epic tragedy we see history play out on a galactic scale and its a story we have seen before here on earth it is beautiful and incredibly ugly the performances are great the visual effects are stunning and the score is unique and yet perfect the feeling that the book inspires is captured here  but it is understandable even without reading the book  see itnow imagine i am using the voice
Nov 18 2021,positive,amazing never watched the original or read the books so i was a bit confused on some aspects but thoroughly entertained 
Nov 18 2021,positive,never read the books so didnt know what to expect going in and so i really enjoyed it it was more got than i thought gorgeous scenic cinematic really worth seeing imax so well acted cant wait to see whats next made me want to read the books
Nov 18 2021,neutral,a bit too much primitive fighting for my taste  predictable storyline and outcome  not enough to capture my interest good acting
Nov 18 2021,negative,unfortunately herberts book has proved again how difficult it is to translate to the screen i see there is a lot of adoration for this film but i certainly wasnt feeling it to be honest i wasnt a massive fan of the book but there was enough of an interesting core story that in the right hands could make an interesting film which would hopefully discard those parts of the book that didnt work but thats not what i saw given only about half of the book is adapted it has an undeserving long running time beautiful cinematography but that doesnt sink or save a movie no life was breathed into frank herberts characters making them uninteresting and unsympathetic the music was torturous and the film dragged not a good watch
Nov 18 2021,positive,im not familiar with the books because the lore never interested me but nowadays when wild scifi movies appear i have to catch them all and i really liked it fincher version was always a bit too wtf for me this is really more watchable waiting for the next movie
Nov 18 2021,positive,sets and props were much cleaner than original movie  not so overthetop art deco the actors and acting were spot on and the whole movie adaptation followed the book much closer overall very enjoyable for dune fans
Nov 18 2021,positive,this is a great adaptation that really captures the epic feel of the book i only hope part 2 is as good or better
Nov 18 2021,positive,direction casting performances cinematography costumes and adherence to the book were all stellar highly recommended
Nov 18 2021,positive,this is a refreshing spin on action and adventure movies in adaptations of dune past directors attempted to stuff a massive plot into too small of timeframes for the first time ever i left the theater it was actually hbo max who am i kidding feeling conflicted the worldbuilding was phenomenal but ive become so accustomed to movies being wrapped up with a pretty bow and a happy ending infinity war excluded that i was left unsatisfied despite this i would not say it was an unpleasant unsatisfactoriness in fact i remained feeling anxious for the next release i would not have thought it possible for this conflict to insight any emotion other than frustration but it does not how can it when the entirety of this movie had a purpose i cant be mad at a slowermoving plot simply because i know the setup will be worth it in future films so i find myself conflicted but pleasantly so it is refreshing and i hope future franchises take more stock in worldbuilding than flashy effects and big fight scenes
Nov 18 2021,positive,stuck to the book the music was great the vistas were striking cant wait for the rest of the movies in this franchise
Nov 18 2021,positive,this is a refreshing spin on action and adventure movies in adaptations of dune past directors attempted to stuff a massive plot into too small of timeframes for the first time ever i left the theater it was actually hbo max who am i kidding feeling conflicted the worldbuilding was phenomenal but ive become so accustomed to movies being wrapped up with a pretty bow and a happy ending infinity war excluded that i was left unsatisfied despite this i would not say it was an unpleasant unsatisfactoriness in fact i remained feeling anxious for the next release   i would not have thought it possible for this conflict to insight any emotion other than frustration but it does not how can it when the entirety of this movie had a purpose i cant be mad at a slowermoving plot simply because i know the setup will be worth it in future films so i find myself conflicted but pleasantly so it is refreshing and i hope future franchises take more stock in worldbuilding than flashy effects and big fight scenes
Nov 18 2021,positive,breathtaking masterpiece simply stunning
Nov 17 2021,positive,excellent cinematography some plot lines cut but i understand why for pacing
Nov 17 2021,positive,while it is true that this movie follows the book more closely than the david lynch debacle i wasnt as impressed as most folks this movie was like tron with better visuals lots of longtracking shots and people walking in vformation for no apparent reason the costumes are great most of the time except for one scene where two main characters wear cloaks that acame from nowhere and barent really necessary in desert heatbut thats a little thing on the other hand the sound design sucks the soundtrack is a series of antonal chord layered atop atonal chords then brought to a earsplitting crescendomost of the time for no apparent reason like the stairways in the winchester house and it is unrelenting probably for effect but i was just annoyed    also please tell denis villeneuve and rebecca ferguson that whispering isnt acting especially when you have to compete with earsplitting soundtracks theres an actual scene where it is just paul and lady jessica whispering to each other but they are buried together under a ton of sand so who might be eavesdropping no one why do people whisper to talk so anyone eavesdropping cant hear you but when you are buried under sand no one is eavesdropping so no need to whisper i hate it when movie elements defy the internal logic a movie should have    if you love dune the trilogy as i do this would have to be the best movie adaptation so far but it could have been so much better
Nov 17 2021,positive,it was an amazing cinematic adventure  i am hearing impaired but there is so little dialogue i did not need to refer to my close caption device much at all  the scenes and the talented actors tell the story sometimes with just a look in their eyes  i look forward to part 2 and hope that director villanueve decides to take on other books in the series  as serious readers know duncan idaho is the final kwisatz haderach but it is a long and twisted story to get there
Nov 17 2021,positive,great film a few divergences from the book and the original film but nothing that changes the story line great effects and very powerful in places
Nov 17 2021,negative,zero one of the worst experiences ever
Nov 17 2021,positive,great cinematography  and the story stays close to the book  great cast as well
Nov 17 2021,positive,dune is the movie of the year and it is quickly becoming one of the best scifi movies i have ever seen dune is a visual and narrative masterpiece every shot of this movie is absolutely breathtaking theres not a moment in the movie where youre not looking at something beautiful dune takes place thousands of years in the future where humanity has colonised the known universe and is controlled by a feudalistic imperialist society ruled by great houses all of whom are loyal to the emperor the story revolves around house atreides when they are sent to the desert world of arrakis or dune to take over from house harkonnen but when the harkonnens attack and retake control of arrakis the survivors of house atreides flee into the dunes in a race for survival in the midst of all of this are the fremen and the shaihulud sand worms that are the hostile natives to arrakis and house atreides must ally themselves with the fremen if they hope to survive and retake the planet from the brutal harkonnens dune is a masterfully crafted story with great characters with understandable motivations backed up by an incredible cast we now have poe dameron thanos drax and pennywises dad all in the same movie what more could we ask for overall dune is a masterpiece and i cant wait for part 2
Nov 17 2021,positive,another great entry into denis villenueves filmography and possibly the start to the next great scifi saga great actors action and sfx cannot wait to see part 2 45 stars
Nov 17 2021,positive,outstanding a mustsee in theaters would watch over and over again if i could afford the ticket prices 
Nov 17 2021,positive,the only criticism i have compared to the book is that theres some internal monologue stuff missing from the movie but most of the internal monologue stuff thats missing is just kinda the animeie kinda noise where its like gah this is my motivation and id rather just be shown not told which the movie does well  another thing it misses from the book is some of the intrigue related to who is the spy but again it doesnt super matter and i have a feeling that theyll cover that in part 2    ive seen it 4 times so far im reading the book shit slaps    and for all the critics who were  like some of the characters arent multidimensional  bro in the book theyre not multidimensional either so chill    duncan idaho is a prime example yueh is another one    so overall the movie rules critics are lame
Nov 17 2021,positive,its slow long long desert scene dark darker 5 minutes dialogue more desert  the main character has less expression than an ameba rebeca ferguson is beautiful has character and makes acting is something easy  great actress  the whole movie needs an effort in concentration but its clearly superior to the original version ambitious but short but one time you got the rhythm its enjoyable  its a saga this is the first chapter so dont try to compare it with the original 84 you would be disappointed almost 25 hs of the movie for the first 30 minutes of the original  photography is impressive special effects is excellent  highly recommendable but take your time you cannot chew this movie spit and keep moving
Nov 17 2021,positive,really enjoyed this more accurate telling of the long and complex science fiction masterpiece   this movie was such a good part1 to this book that it really makes me sad that first movie was ever made despite it being a cult classic
Nov 17 2021,positive,absolutely amazing i could not find any fault in the script nor in the acting of the characters   sound and picture lights and visuals so overwhelming and perfect finally i get to see a good movie after years of waiting before i die
Nov 17 2021,positive,a whole lot more accurate to the books than the older film soundtrack and designs were outstanding
Nov 17 2021,positive,great unfolding of the story the cinematography is outstanding
Nov 17 2021,positive,there was an odd crawl at parts of the movie but overall the movie was amazing i cannot wait for part 2
Nov 17 2021,positive,the visuals are groundbreaking and the scope of its range is definitely ambitious but overall the slow pace and the long runningtime fills the story with more information than the viewers can handle leaving them hanging for something to happen
Nov 17 2021,positive,after watching dune it has become my new fave scifi craze loved the plot and character development and entertained by the entire production i went in not knowing what to expect and left super excited to watch the next movie sequences
Nov 17 2021,positive,great story amazing visuals and an epic soundtrack for me this is the best film of the year and i recommend it
Nov 17 2021,positive,villeneuve really has outdone himself with this one it was great to see the book come to life at such a mesmerizing and grand scale a visual masterpiece he really brought to life so many fascinating concepts and moments with such fidelity pauls transformation felt so authentic even more than the books both timothy and rebecca have given such powerful organic performances even the moments that came off slightly contrived in the books came off so naturally persuasive
Nov 17 2021,positive,denis villeneuves dune brilliantly adapts the first half of frank herberts groundbreaking sciencefiction novel it is somewhat openended so im glad wb has greenlit a sequel so that villeneuve can finish the story he previously demonstrated his skill in creating an atmospheric story through films like arrival and blade runner 2049 and he puts all of that experience to use in this film dune is a complex story with a lot of backstory that is best explained in the format of a novel but could lead to too many expositiondumps on screen those who are interested in the story and want to better understand the context of whats going on are recommended to read frank herberts novel otherwise take some spice melange and let villeneuves visuals and hans zimmers music wash over you
Nov 17 2021,positive,dune had great visuals and it was a slowbuilding storyline right when it started getting more interesting it ended and this makes me look forward to part 2 overall it was a very good movie 
Nov 17 2021,positive,its just a hard story to adaptnobody has cracked it yet the longest trailer you will ever watch beautiful thoughthey nailed the look watch with subtitles to hear what the actors are sayingwhisper acting all over the place
Nov 17 2021,negative,dune is two and half hours of setup the film could have easily started with the main character in the dust storm after being kidnapped by the generic evil faction then sporadically have quick flashbacks of recent events what happened in 2 hours of the movie could have been told in 15 minuets oh but the effects are nice so 5 stars right dont waste your time 
Nov 17 2021,positive,just brilliant the visual effects and set up is just fantastic the movie has this deep mythology to it and its truly awesome obviously  movie of the year 
Nov 17 2021,positive,what a movie the visuals help the storytelling and denis did an impeccable job in respecting the source and cant wait for part 2
Nov 17 2021,negative,i thought the original was better
Nov 17 2021,positive,all of it awesomeness
Nov 17 2021,positive,at long long last an intelligent scifi movie whose cgi complements rather than overblows the story a big budget film that is not about superheroes a major hollywood release that is not obsessed with race andor gender which nevertheless has an admirably diverse cast a film you must try to see in the theater i dont care how big your tv is at home this movie was made for the cinema i am grateful for this film
Nov 17 2021,positive,it pass the time not much of a choice between two other movies in hilo i saw eternal last week i not sfi fan i do enjoy once a week going to the movies looking forward to a few movies coming out which are my kind of movies
Nov 17 2021,positive,a great world was created here but slowly very slowly paced
Nov 17 2021,positive,beautiful and amazing cinematography it was also a great set up for future movies
Nov 17 2021,positive,the lore of this universe is phenomenal and action in this movie is a nice cherry on top
Nov 17 2021,positive,the score of the movie was phenomenal the visuals were absolutely stunning acting was fantastic very well cast
Nov 17 2021,positive,it kept my attention the whole time exciting story line amazing action and a wonderful build up visually and mentally stimulating
Nov 17 2021,negative,the cgi in dune was nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece this much is true having said that their budgeting team can only be described as too incompetent to manage even a 5 year olds lemonade stand their extensive spending on cgi and the cast in this movie left it devastatingly devoid of any plot    the first sign that something was about to go terribly wrong was the appearance of the words part one in the title screen for this movie it was a feeling akin to watching a family member you have never met get lowered into a grave as someone going into this movie with no preconceptions other than other people having said that it was well worth the watch this was quite disconcerting     the music was indeed beautiful thanks to the mastery that is hans zimmer yet during scenes with whispered dialogue this same music was excruciatingly loud i can only imagine that the sound engineer was huffing spice throughout the entire process as that is the only possible explanation for the absolute horror and confusion that i experienced while trying to hear the few plot points spoken at all in this train wreck that you cant seem to look away from    what little dialogue you could hear was simply disappointing as the majority of the lines spoken in this movie have the general tone of a fiveyearolds first attempt at screen writing a play for their elderly grandparents not even grandma would approve of this atrocity she would likely say maybe screen writing isnt for you with a look in her eyes that is typically only seen when a child is about to be excommunicated from the family    it is genuinely astonishing that this movie which was recommended by a friend as phenomenal and one of the best movies they had ever seen somehow was given the green light by not one not two but many people in hollywood who should have been willing to toss a lifesaver out to the poor fool who ever thought that this would be even half decent sincerely i hope that every executive that signed off on this loses their job and has to dumpster dive behind innout to get by for the foreseeable future    after spending an agonizing 150 minutes wondering when this misery would end there was a glimmer of hope that our ordeal was finally over the light at the end of the tunnel was shown as the movie seemed to move towards a conclusion and yet when the credits rolled i was left more confused than a floridian hooker in a ballroom    the silver lining of this experience was that i paid only 636usd for admission had i paid any more than that i would likely consider taking a long walk off a short pier i am on the floor of my room right now praying to whatever god may be out there that my wife does not find out that i paid money to see this masterpiece if she becomes aware of this mistake i fear for what is in store for me
Nov 17 2021,positive,it was a little slow at times but entertaining
Nov 17 2021,positive,great movie to really setup part 2
Nov 17 2021,positive,love itits so much better than the originalwaiting for the second installment
Nov 17 2021,negative,tedious loud and very sandy
Nov 17 2021,negative,you people must love being bored i have no idea what i just watched 
Nov 17 2021,positive,amazing exceeded my expectations
Nov 17 2021,positive,best movie of the year true to the book 
Nov 17 2021,negative,the whole 2 12 hours was a like a setup for something exciting to happenthat doesnt happen    the action in the movie was very predictable and disappointing
Nov 17 2021,neutral,the movie was visually pleasing but it ends there this reboot is just a copy if the epic 1984 movie but this dune leaves you asking why spice and what aliens i cant but help compare it to the original and the titan actors they graced the screen now replaced this time by two hormone abusing failed athletes bautista and mimosa continuing that trend in film and a funny man oscar isaac thats not being funny the feminism is distasteful but thats part of the original story
Nov 17 2021,positive,this dune film succeeds at adapting one of the most quintessential science fiction books  the movie is as much a visual and auditory experience as it is a vehicle for storytelling  the fantastic scenery is matched by an endlessly incredible and immersive soundtrack often more sound effect than score      dune succeeds at presenting one of science fictions first goals making us feel small in an enormous and uncaring universe while also asking us where our meaningful place is in it      the narrative deviates in a meaningful manner from many other scifi stories  there is a considerable emphasis placed on a transgalactic feudal system  eight thousand years in the future and people are still exploited for their labor  lives are cheap and spent at the whims of the ultrawealthy      war is primarily fought with individual soldiers fighting hand to hand with blades this further supports the motif of the feudal age  the reason for this development is personal shields which negate the efficacies of firearms  most of the narrative has a level of technology much lower than one might expect from scifi  this allows the film to focus on relatable people being at the center of the story    almost every scene of the film is given a long time to breathe this allows for a richer emotional experience  it also supports the feeling of insignificance and isolation in a vast uncaring universe     the pacing of the film drags as a result of that choice  however it was undoubtedly the right decision to make this movie just onehalf of the eponymous book
Nov 16 2021,positive,not enough action but good movie
Nov 16 2021,positive,im surprised in a good way i thought it would be boring but i was wrong such good movie      i recommend it
Nov 16 2021,positive,excellent im a huge fan of the original i know its bad but its nostalgia  so i was hesitant to see this  plus the main character is skinny  im sorry he is lol this was phenomenal  excellent a little heavy on the music but other than that absolutely stunning  im just sad the next one is not out until 2023
Nov 16 2021,positive,amazing for what it is the only problem is that its half of a movie being its part 1 it doesnt really leave off on a cliff hanger that makes you excited for part 2 more of it needs part 2 i was ready for more movie then it just ends but i understand most people dont want to sit in a theater for 3 hours but i sure could have
Nov 16 2021,positive,a masterpiece no words i was young the first time i saw david lynchs version and really liked it but this it is so different at so many levels i first saw it on imax screen following villeneuves recommendation imho it is a requirement not a suggestion the bigger the screen the bigger the immersion inside dunes universe the wait for part two is going to be painful already on my third watch this movie is simply awesome
Nov 16 2021,positive,i enjoyed this movie once the first 50 or so minutes passed  you need patience to get into it if you are not a dune fan to begin with like me  it seemed to show off the scenery more than give you an actual story at the beginning  plus they threw names of peopleplacesthings around like we have been watching a series for the past 3 seasons  i was confused at first and was losing interest  then the first big battle came and everything else piqued my interest  the movie seemed to get better from there  lots of big stars in this one and clearly this movie sets up for the next one or two  overall this movie is a little too long and they could have cut about 10 minutes of the pretty panning shots in the first hour to tighten up the pacing  recommend as a watch and then again when the second movie is released
Nov 16 2021,negative,its rather hard not to be mad about the ending of the movie considering the fact that the entire thing was a huge set up with no pay off what so ever the movie is about two and a half hours of expositions with a cliff hanger at the end it feel like watching an unskippable cutscene in a video game  jason mamoa and oscar isaac played the only two characters that have some sort of semblance towards being actual characters while the entire cast is very talented they arent given a lot to work with since the characters have maybe one emotion each we cant really blame the actors for how bland and uninteresting the characters are because the book forgot to give everyone personalities too we cant even say the visuals were amazing anymore when talking about a movie like this because honestly when arent they nowadays try to think of any scifi movie that wasnt visually stunning that came out in the past five or so years yes the movie is pretty but that doesnt make up for lack of cohesive and engaging plot as well as bland characters this should have and could have stayed as one movie
Nov 16 2021,positive,there is some peril in finishing a book for the first time two weeks before the movie comes out and absorbing almost anything you can about the book with the remaining time impressions are very fresh as are ideas of what is crucial to include in a faithful adaptation sure id seen lynchs version long ago but as much as i think that version is a beautiful disaster in its own right it certainly was not where my lasting impressions arose after reading herberts epic    throughout and immediately after the movie my first impression was that villeneuve had curiously accomplished the feat of capturing brilliantly the subtleties that give meaning to so much of the novel but had left out some important centerstage events but as i walked to my car most of these complaints melted away after reading some reviews dargis and especially klion were very sharp among some less so to help collect my thoughts i was settled that many though not all changes were in fact for the better     in many ways the subtleties are more important and beyond that most of the changes make sense in a major commercial adaptation upon further reflection it is impossible after all for a movie to try to convey everything a book does on a books terms and dune the film mostly does a great job of finding ways to show not tell     i still might have preferred the threehour version of this with a little more time spent on the intrigues of arrakeen before things start blowing up and josh brolin is probably not ugly enough to play gurney halleck and i might have enjoyed more time spent between paul and thufir hawat but the last two gripes are minor and the first is tolerable especially as any adapting director must figure out the right balance to sustain his movies ecosystem     beyond the script the visuals were incredible few can match villeneuves mind for concepts and piecing together just how things would look in many cases he puts that skill to use in a way that allows the production design to do some of the exposition stripped from the dialogue zimmers score is fantastic in its simplicity relying mainly on just a few riffs that perfectly fit their setting the performances besides brolins notquiteangularenoughinmymind face leave little to be desired though it will be interesting to see if chalomet can muster the detached gravitas that the second half of the story requires     really worth seeing on the big screen if for nothing other than the visuals to the best of my knowledge i saw it on the biggest in tennessee i reserve the right to raise this rating by half a star as i marinate more on it but right now its two in the morning and i just wanted my thoughts out of my body    eta i am taking advantage of my reserved right to raise this rating to 45 i read almost as many words about this movie and previous attempts to film dune and the book itself as are contained in herberts tome certainly more than ive consumed about any individual movie in recent memory if this interest in taking in more wasnt enough to suggest that i thought the movie was special the fact that i consistently found myself agreeing with the positive reactions and furrowing my brow at the negative was    this bit of metareflection along with a growing sense that the score might have been zimmers magnum opus that rebecca ferguson was truly special and that villeneuves changes did not sap much from the meaning of the book all push me towards the higher rating all of this being said i reserve the right to change my mind as i inevitably absorb more and more in the coming days and weeks and years until part two    next question is it a jewvie kwisatz haderach is hebrew and others have noted its a jewish story in some ways but that might be tenuous
Nov 16 2021,negative,its just ok kind of boring the storytelling was slow and not very intreguing much of story is about some weird destiny and speaking power very beautiful in some shots and really captivating vehicle designs the music got enoying after a while mixed with the weird sounds that hurt my ears it feels to me that is träning to be mysterium artsy and deep meh
Nov 16 2021,positive,i like the subtle changes  disappointed it was a part 1  id rather have the whole thing with an intermission
Nov 16 2021,positive,while undoubtedly a more comprehensive adaptation than its 1984 predecessor theres not much that will make this film a classic in the long run
Nov 16 2021,negative,so confusing way too long  the scenery looked nice but that about it  terrible movie
Nov 16 2021,positive,i had a difficult time on occasions to follow the story line  i think i was trying to hard to compare with the original film which i saw on tv last week  perhaps that is unfair to this production
Nov 16 2021,positive,this film is clearly setting the stage for something vastly greater and thats what most of the movie feels like readers of the original story will be able to confirm what i say despite this its splendidly adapted there are very few directors and screenwriters capable of doing something like what has been achieved here while i dont think its a masterpiece this movie manages to blend an epic story with science fiction very well    beautiful photography performances at the height of history visual and special effects according to the best that this year can deliver and hans zimmer also shines with his soundtrack    it will be acclaimed it will be a success and it will be the beginning of a cult legend
Nov 16 2021,positive,if you have an understanding of religion politics and enjoy scifi then youll love this movie  honestly the best movie ive seen in years  dont take anyone whos dim witted  they wont be able to follow the story line and will just annoy you with questions
Nov 16 2021,positive,visually spectacular but slow paced storytelling
Nov 16 2021,positive,it crafts worlds that feel real and isnt afraid to take its time to do so the ornithopters and rescue scene stole the show for me i think anyone complaining about the pacing of this film went in expecting another throwaway cgi fest when in reality villeneuves dune is a cacophonous masterpiece to be savoured and enjoyed   i adore this film
Nov 16 2021,positive,the only thing that didnt work for me was the pacing of the movie it moves slow and fast at inopportune moments but the work was great and i really liked paul
Nov 16 2021,positive,great scifi action movie with an interesting engaging storyline i cant wait for the next part
Nov 16 2021,positive,its great but i like the old one more so far
Nov 16 2021,positive,great movie and storyline the ending i didnt like expected more good cliff hanger thought 9510
Nov 16 2021,positive,everything was excellent the acting story line human relations cinematography music scene sets
Nov 16 2021,positive,absolutely blew me away i went into the film without any prior knowledge of the books and found it visually striking and with an expansive universe that i cant wait to see more of in sequels
Nov 16 2021,positive,surprisingly i wasnt expecting too much from this movie instead i was treated to a stunning masterpiece dune has great visualsgreat acting and a large scale of story its worth seeing in theaters
Nov 16 2021,positive,i love the idea of using desert as a main place and using future condition with planet conflict but this movie still not complete its just an intro a little bit disapointed about the story line still not clear and no emotion
Nov 16 2021,positive,this is for all the adults who have long since been jaded by the later iterations of the magical star wars franchise of their youth no more cloying characters designed to sell kids merchandise i had zero expectations and not even that much interest in the movie dune now has me hooked and i cant wait for the next installment
Nov 16 2021,positive,dune presents a wonderful and interesting new world a very good story and incredible characters without a doubt i am looking forward to the second part
Nov 16 2021,neutral,movie was slow i actually liked the 80s version better
Nov 16 2021,positive,ngl didnt know what was going on and nothing really happened 
Nov 16 2021,positive,2 hrs and 35 minutes long  when you really dont care a movie that would be a really really long time  this movie did not seem that long at all because you guessed itit was great and timothee chalamet was superb  cant wate for round ii
Nov 16 2021,positive,dune part one   i dont read many books more than once i first read the dune trilogy in 8th grade  i barely made it through the complexities and sophisticated intrigue of the narrative  but when i did it went on my trophy wall of books read since then i have read the trilogy three times it is not an easy read herbert makes you work dune is consistantly ranked in the top five of science fiction works ever written all that said i liked the movie i liked it a lot i liked the casting the editing zimmers music villeneuves vision and directing the look the feel etc it is quite beautiful but i suspect  the uninitiated will need to work hard to access the story  this is not star wars this is a political religious and philosophical drama that is tighter and more interesting than got the movie plays as subtle as the source if you liked herberts book or the films sicario arrival or blade runner 2049 also directed by villeneuve you will probably like dune as i did kids nah way too sophisticated and slow paced by todays attention spans some pg 13 violence i think an r rated cut would have helped create more intensity
Nov 16 2021,positive,gorgeous cinematography  followed the book fairly well  a few significant deviations  definitely less violent  bloody than the original 1984 movie  it may be hard to follow if you havent read all the books or seen the 2 previous movies  cant wait for part ii
Nov 16 2021,positive,it followed the book very closely  the appearance of the technology was refreshingly creative rather than just imitating what others had done  awesome movie
Nov 16 2021,positive,i really like deserts this movie sure as heck provided that the lore was really cool i hope they end up making all 6 books into movies
Nov 16 2021,negative,i think its wonderful that this movie exists and im very happy for everyone who enjoys it so much for me though the characters just feel too damn hollow and joyless to care what happens to them i like what dune the original book series does with its story so id like to see an adaptation actually manage to adapt the whole thing in a competent way this movie is definitely competent but i cant help but feel after watching it that it was a mistake to try to adapt the first book in two parts like this since it leaves this one feeling incomplete i feel like ill probably like this movie even less as time goes on because its just not interesting for me to watch everyone is so dour and serious and the color palette is really muted it makes me long for the bizarre excess of the david lynch adaptation
Nov 16 2021,positive,slow burn but got really good towards the end  looking forward to the additional installments
Nov 16 2021,negative,boring visuals and even worse the musical score   little about the worms a lot about familial relationships that were hard to follow and i wished didnt matter  little conversation or personalities all monotone with little drama or emotion  great for those who have the book memorized i think
Nov 16 2021,positive,it felt like a movie that was building towards a sequel from the start it had so much potential to be a great standalone movie its the same mistakes that marvel movies make with 85 of their movies the ending never felt like an ending either a bit underwhelming forgettable is what i take from this movie    i would of gave this movie a 25 but the film score and beautiful scenery in the movie saved it from being a worse rating
Nov 16 2021,positive,powerful experience nothing else like it ignore the  fans and go watch it in a cinema now
Nov 15 2021,positive,liked the special effects and that it followed the book did like all the commercials before the movie
Nov 15 2021,positive,impressive movie given the source material it is difficult capturing all the elements of the book but this movie comes very close the preminisions could be less in my opinion and i found thimothee at first very feminine for a son of the duke but thats just me i guess after reading the book long time ago i had envisioned another character  all in all a good movie sometimes little slow paced but very refreshing after all the same and now boring marvell movies we get to see
Nov 15 2021,positive,brilliant beautiful
Nov 15 2021,positive,impressive really enjoyed it
Nov 15 2021,negative,sadly the movie was slowthe writing  direction failed to maximize the use of such great cast they used over two hours to vaguely set the tone if the original dune had todays fx it would have been icing on the cake unfortunately the newer version spent more time with sceneries than actual quality directing and story telling i am thankful i have hbo max and it saved me a trip to the cinema hopefully there will be a sequel and the director actually directs  better
Nov 15 2021,positive,the plot was a bit confusing for someone who has not read the novels but the sound design and the special effects were very  impressive those both made the two and a half hour run time feel like time well spent i would highly recommend it to anyone who loves impressive scifi movies
Nov 15 2021,positive,fantastic film visually spectacular and great story never seen dune 1984 but watch it after this one dune 2021 is similar to the 1984 but with great acting and fantastic visuals dune is absolutely better then star wars its sad dune dont get as much attention
Nov 15 2021,positive,love great cinematography 
Nov 15 2021,positive,you want to be blown away by the new version  the sets the stars the cgi the source material  but the experience in retrospect 3 weeks ago for me is pretty forgettable the lynch version was much disparaged at the time but featured a number of sequences  the hunterseeker drone attack on paul the slow death of duncan the water droplet in the hidden reservoir harkonnen depravity pauls weirding scream at the defeated feydrautha harkonnen sting little alias menacing confrontation of jose ferrers emperor  that were pretty inventive and are actually iconic moments of 1980s cinema in retrospect the new version despite vast sets cgi and star power only offered one scene that sticks with me three weeks later javier bardems introduction to the duke chalamet seems like a nice guy in interviews but he doesnt bring enough gravitas to be the messiah of prophecy  his interaction with duncan in the hangar is the worst scene in the movie  cringeworthy bad
Nov 15 2021,positive,the start of something that will likely never be remade in lifetimes its that good of an adaptation
Nov 15 2021,positive,going in i knew nothing about dune other than the story was long and complicated knowing that i thought the movie did an excellent job of keeping me informed without losing me  everything else was very well done as is my expectation of this director  all in all i enjoyed it and look forward to seeing part ii
Nov 15 2021,negative,the movie was so long and boring made me doze off quite a few times and even then i still understood what was happening
Nov 15 2021,positive,this is a great movie i loved hans zimmer sound design
Nov 15 2021,positive,it was perfect for what it should have been
Nov 15 2021,positive,very nicely paced and shot film the use of sound is impressive once i realized that this director also did arrival and blade runner 2049 it made more sense to me
Nov 15 2021,positive,loved it cant wait for the 2nd half a visually striking film
Nov 15 2021,positive,a significant improvement to the original denis villeneuves dune is an incredible and visually stellar film that stands as one of the best of this year thanks to its intriguing story great acting and incredible world building followed with gorgeous effects the story however is a bit sluggish at first though it quickly quickens its pace as the first act comes to a close
Nov 15 2021,positive,a truly fantastic movie that in a brilliant way sets the stage for the upcoming titels in the  very exciting duneverse this is imo the most visually pleasing film yet of villeneuves body of work which is saying a lot the movie left me in awe craving for more and within a week i went to see it again
Nov 15 2021,positive,dune was simply brilliant the cinematography was amazing grand and magnificent something that must be seen in theater this atmosphere was brought to a zenith by a brilliant score by hans zimmer and great sound design all of this was beautifully melded together by the great directing of denis villeneuve  and superb acting from the entire cast i was also especially happy to find that the movie stayed deeply loyal to frank herberts original this does lead to one of the few major problems with the movie the fact that the 1965 original was deeply rooted in orientalist fantasies of islam the arab world and white savior narratives and this made its way into the movie as well   98100
Nov 15 2021,positive,great job on the technology the impression of time lapse seemed way too compressed  it appeared that house atrides had only been on dune for a weekend by the time the harkonians attacked
Nov 15 2021,positive,just felt good about the movie liked the characters and the build up made me leave wanting more
Nov 15 2021,positive,delivered everything the original lacked the tools to do bit of a slow start but knowing its being stretched over multiple installments makes that forgivable  jason momoa was exactly who he is no shock overshadowed by an amazing cast
Nov 15 2021,negative,boring even having read the book the movie made little sense and went on forever it was dark lots of noise very cute young boy but that sure wasnt enough to hold my attention what a waste rates in the 10 worst movies i have ever seen
Nov 15 2021,positive,kind of like a dark star wars  along the line of riddick great movie cant wait for part ii
Nov 15 2021,positive,the music score was awesome the characters and character developments were believable and well acted the storyline was engaging it didnt feel like i was sitting there for over 2 hours i want to see what happens next
Nov 15 2021,positive,too slowmoving wasnt crazy about actor who played paul atreides
Nov 15 2021,positive,from someone that knows nothing about the books this movie was beautiful executed
Nov 15 2021,negative,wooden joyless uninspired script  mailedin performances  timothée chalamet was insufferable smug when not totally bored  is this what mainstream movies are going to be from now on  does anyone even remember what it was like when mainstream american movies were good instead of just another out of too many choices  please spare us part ii
Nov 15 2021,positive,perfect great shots great sound great story doesnt get much better than this stoked for part 2
Nov 15 2021,positive,it is certainly breathtakingly beautiful and epic in scale and the actors are completely believable but i didnt quite enjoy it as much as i thought i might it was very slow and i kept anticipating what was going to happen next having seen the david lynch version a few times and read the book a couple of times so that drew me out of the experience villeneuve made jessica very weepy which i thought was a bit of a downgrade for the character still a good spectacle though
Nov 15 2021,positive,very well cast  rebecca ferguson especially stands out  and hans zimmers score was epic
Nov 15 2021,positive,what denis has managed to create is remarkable and its beautiful the masterful cinematographer greig fraser with beautiful lowlight shots and hans zimmer score just gives you instant goosebumps it almost seems timothee chalamet was made for the role of paul atreides he plays the character so well and it seems this is gonna blow him into even more stardom if this does turn into a trilogy       i expected a more slower movie just given the source material and it being part 1 of a dense book but i felt the pacing was perfect and really picked up jason momoa and josh brolin were two badass characters hope to see more of them rebecca ferguson plays the character of a mother so well very vulnerable constantly because of her worry of her son paul oscar isaac is a beautiful man and a wonderful actor and both of them are on display in this movie     its sad to think the sequel isnt greenlit but it probably will and a 3rd film after that its exciting to go on this journey and im all for it i recommend as does everyone else seeing it in imax or even a dolby theater the only downfall which isnt really a downfall is that denis will be focused on dune for the next maybe 5 years on dune instead of potential original ideas but i think dune is worth it
Nov 15 2021,negative,not sure what the plot was exactly very long at least it felt that way had to fight sleeping in the theater
Nov 15 2021,positive,plot characters special effectsit was great  stayed true to the book yet was easy to follow
Nov 15 2021,neutral,a cliche scifi flick thats no better than any foundation on apple tv the whole the one trope is played out to death and the magic seems to follow no rules so there are no real stakes add that to thin dialogue and predictable plot and youve got a real mediocre story and the cliffhanger at the end makes me want to watch the rest even less
Nov 15 2021,positive,excellent movie great special effects and great acting love the cast this was my second time seeing it and id see it again
Nov 15 2021,negative,terrible movie waste of my 3 hours
Nov 15 2021,positive,plenty of good moments but too long and slow at times shave off 45 minutes and im sold timothee chalamet was great as usual though
Nov 15 2021,positive,very well done was so involved the entire time
Nov 15 2021,positive,dune is a really good movie with incredible acting action and scope i cant wait for part 2
Nov 15 2021,negative,twice as much time with two movies compared to the original and gave half as much detail the first movie was so much better such a poor casting choice for paul atreides such a weak little mamas boy
Nov 15 2021,positive,this movie was way more enjoyable than the originalthe acting and cast were perfectthe fact it will be in 2 partsover 5 hoursmake part 2 something to look forward to
Nov 15 2021,positive,lord of the rings matrix terminator 2 these movies set a new standard for their genre this movie too sets a new standard realism storytelling acting science fiction needed this film
Nov 15 2021,negative,very predictable i wont see dune 2 if comes up
Nov 15 2021,positive,good job of portraying the original book  excellent cast
Nov 15 2021,positive,i thought it was awesome considering id never seen the original though i didnt know what to expect    my husband on the other hand wasnt happy with it  he said that was only half of the story he said they left a lot outhe wasnt happy about it being a part one meaning theres a part two leaving him hanging not knowing when part two would come out  but i wouldnt have known so to me it was awesome  amy time i get to see jason momoas sexy hands yum
Nov 15 2021,positive,like stunning visually story is close to the book  dislike awkward pauses
Nov 15 2021,positive,as you would expect from villeneuve the film is visually stunning admittedly there are moments where the writing doesnt always seem to match the overall tone and some of the themes and lore dont hit quite as hard as i would have liked them to and despite the films runtime it felt incomplete this story was clearly setting up for a part 2 and you could feel it i could have spent another half hour in this world to see some things progress a little further which is honestly the best compliment i can give
Nov 15 2021,positive,epic sound was fantastic will be watching again
Nov 15 2021,neutral,compared to the book and the 1984 version of the movie the characters seem stupid and weak willed it makes various alterations or additions to the story which generally weaken the story the visuals are nice though
Nov 15 2021,positive,it was beautifully shot it lack some action but the storytelling is very good and you understand that its a really good warmup for the next movie
Nov 15 2021,positive,loved this blend of fantasy and science fiction  read the book well over 30years ago and remember what a blast it was
Nov 15 2021,positive,i thought they didnt develop enough on the relationship between the mother and her son
Nov 15 2021,positive,it was a stirring movie with amazing visual effects and soundtrack a few times in the movie i had to close my eyes because it was the slightest bit scary i will be looking forward to the next one
Nov 15 2021,positive,this book fan loved it all the characters were well cast all of the important story elements were there and the scenery and music really took us to their worlds awesome
Nov 15 2021,positive,awesome  the sound was phenomenal really impressive representation of frank herberts exceptional world building
Nov 15 2021,positive,theres 5star cgi but not enough action to satisfy its anticipated hype they gave us much less than we were expecting 
Nov 15 2021,positive,everyone in hollywood should take notes this movie is pure effort looks beautiful sounds tremendous pacing is perfect not my favorite actors yet the director brings the best out of everyone i love when nerdy source material is taken seriously sometimes it felt like it could have taken a breather for dune is serious start to finish nonetheless i was very entertained if the academy has any honor left this movie should sweep at the academy awards
Nov 15 2021,positive,great film cast was excellent and the visuals were amazing soundmusic was terrific cant wait for part 2
Nov 15 2021,positive,fairly close to the book
Nov 15 2021,positive,dune 2021 is fantastic visually and aurally stunning and surprisingly respectful to the novel highly recommended for those seeking serious and entertaining adult science fiction a rarity
Nov 15 2021,positive,this was a wonderful film all the performances were excellent looking forward to part 2
Nov 14 2021,negative,boring boring boring
Nov 14 2021,positive,technically superb and visually appealing its only limit is the excess of epicity that we find in so many scenes
Nov 14 2021,negative,never read the books and have to say that i would much rather read from the beginning than to watch another movie i thought that the actors showed promise but that is as far as the entertainment goes according to my husband this movies missed the mark and a lot of the important story was lost the dialogue was very hard to follow and while the story tried to make sense it didnt
Nov 14 2021,negative,slow nothing really happens
Nov 14 2021,positive,ya know i was actually worried about this one at first as i am a fan of the dune novels as well as the 1984 david lynch movie which i kinda grew up with well i can say now with confidence dune is a great film and they were right to go with denis villeneuves vision of frank herberts work ive seen others say it and i agree this feels like the dark knight take on dune not nearly as crazy or as outlandish as other attempts this adaptation choses to scale back some of the expansiveness  craziness of dune and focus on just the beginning of the of young pauls story it also has quite possibly one of the most original soundtracks ive heard in a while which chooses to go in a more ambient  avant guard style instead of a heavy orchestral space opera we would have all expected i enjoyed the casts performances most notably for me oscar issac as the duke leto atedies   i would highly recommend dune to long time fans as well as first timers interested in seeing a more modern retelling of the classic scifi novel
Nov 14 2021,positive,i liked every bit of the movie
Nov 14 2021,negative,murky mumbled dialogue relentlessly depressing a story that strikes just one note from beginning to end  my husband and i went despite friends saying it was a stinker because hed read the book and loved it  for his sake i hung in for 90 minutes before asking if hed mind if i bailed  he said hed been ready to leave since 30 minutes in  since i hadnt read the book i had no idea what the story was about or who i was supposed to root for and the screenplay left no clues an obvious analogy to the oil situation in the middle east maybe it will be a hit there but we wont be waiting for the sequel
Nov 14 2021,positive,i loved stanley kuprick films they were meticulous often slow paced but not boring similar feeling visually its amazing but the world had a feeling which is id imagine really hard to do i think youd benefit from watching the earlier version and i wish i had read the books or at least first book prior because you can tell theres a bit of context that was just too long to include or was intentionally left confusing but not to the detraction of the movie it was just so good you wanted to know more about everything at the end
Nov 14 2021,positive,good as the book  good cinematography lots of action
Nov 14 2021,positive,simply an amazing adaptation of a nearly unadaptable book the lore and universe building the dune book surpasses even game of thrones yet somehow villeneuve manages to capture that lore in an approachable manner the visuals the music the acting its all just amazing i have already watched the movie many times and each time i notice new details my spouse did not read the book but was still mostly able to track the movie whether you read the book or not i highly recommend this movie
Nov 14 2021,positive,this movie is epic the pacing is consistent and perfect all the way through the music invigorating and the imagery stunning beyond belief this series could be on par with lord of the rings super enthralling and the story is told in such a way that you feel as if you are a part of it i actually jumped back a bit in the theatre because of how well done one of the creatures was honestly gave me a whoa feeling worth every penny
Nov 14 2021,positive,dune was a well put together movie to represent a old book with todays technology
Nov 14 2021,positive,best scifi movie i have seen in years almost every shot was a masterpiece of composition
Nov 14 2021,positive,spectacular of course but somehow felt a bit empty in places  for me vielleneuve is like a better version of christopher nolan
Nov 14 2021,positive,having already perfected his style of somber cerebral storytelling villeneuve ascends to new heights with this masterful execution of cinematic worldbuilding truly an auteur for the modern audience
Nov 14 2021,positive,i liked the interesting stories of each charachter as well as how they adapted to the challenges confronting them
Nov 14 2021,positive,it was a solid movie but yes it is a slowmoving movie where you need to appreciate the milieu as they slowly introduce characters and plot if they had released this movie along with 2 sequels all at the same time it would have been better as this movie is mostly an artistic introduction to get things rolling
Nov 14 2021,positive,the whole movie was great much closer to the book
Nov 14 2021,negative,painfully bad  dune is one directors attempt to see how big epic sweeping and grandiose a movie he can make what it became is 3 hours of absurdly long close ups constant shots of stars posing endless somber conversations in hushed tones and a confusing incoherent script this movie is a preening mess  sword and knife battles are the standard even though ultra high tech devices and  space ships are everywhere   yes the cinematography is amazing as everyone says but  if you film cool angles nice lighting and special effects of a bag of garbage its still a film of a bag of trash a nicely filmed bag of trash   but there is one bright spot in the film   the principal characters do a monty python silly walk in the sand   so theres that
Nov 14 2021,positive,loved it  very great visuals
Nov 14 2021,positive,consider dune like going to a museum of fine art for you dont have to be a scifi fan you dont even have to fully understand dune to appreciate this filmmaking for the masterpiece that it is see it on the big screen which is a must which it is truly designed for as it will completely envelope you into this atmospheric otherworldly place and you will believe it by the serious realism of its high strangenessno hollywood cliche or caricatures here in fact when you see it once see it again for when you are less involved with trying to follow the story you can see with fresh eyes the incredible level of artistry at play every frame can stand alone a visual feast of juxtaposition in brutalism and the semi abstract playing with symmetry asymmetry spacial tension the golden circle the rule of thirds chiaroscuro of light and darkits all there in the brushstrokes of a master the music elevates orchestrating you into this ethereal world with celestial sounds evoking moods that stir your emotions with each pulsating passing shot im left breathless by the majesty of this film this director denis villeneuve can walk among the gods in my book as he has taken the art of filmmaking to the epic level where they reside
Nov 14 2021,positive,never been so wrong with my initial view of a movie watched it a second time and loved it the acting the storyline the action etc were on point excited for the next one 
Nov 14 2021,positive,amazing theater experience with the sound and cinematography loved the story and the portrayals by so many of my favorite actors and excited to see what comes next
Nov 14 2021,positive,the gold standard for scifi fantasy anyone who wants to make a scifi fantasy movie should study the original book dune and this movie its so good
Nov 14 2021,neutral,not very good not very well set up few good characters barely got into an interesting world so maybe the next one will be better enjoyed some scenes and benefited from big budget and cinematic experience
Nov 14 2021,positive,bellissimo film in tutto da vedere assolutamente la regia di villeneuve regista ricordiamo di film capolavoro come  blade runner 2049 prisoners arrival il cast davvero ottimo azzeccato in tutto regia eccellente non si stacca gli occhi dallo schermo per un solo istante non stanca e non è noioso anzi appassiona e tanto come invece lo è stato il primo dune il film che rispecchia in tutto il romanzo speriamo che ci siano gli altri seguiti visto che non è finito ed è per ora il primo penso di almeno una trilogia consiglio a tutti gli appassionati di fantascienza e non di vederlo in quanto non si rimane delusi anzi si resta abbagliati dalla sua bellezza    beautiful film in all to be seen absolutely directed by villeneuve director remember of masterpiece films such as blade runner 2049 prisoners arrival the cast is really excellent spot on everything excellent direction does not take your eyes off the screen for a single moment not tired and not boring indeed passionate and a lot as the first dune was the film that reflects throughout the novel we hope that there are other sequels since it is not finished and is for now the first i think of at least a trilogy i recommend to all fans of science fiction and not to see it as it is not disappointed but rather dazzled by its beauty
Nov 14 2021,positive,outstanding cinematography set design score costumes and all technical aspects of the film enjoyable
Nov 14 2021,positive,nicely done adaptation  checks all the major boxes for being inline with the books
Nov 14 2021,positive,does justice to frank herberts epic tale
Nov 14 2021,positive,visually amazing good acting could have been closer to the books but i really like this take i was just mad they stop the story
Nov 14 2021,positive,brilliantly cast and directed excellent visuals  its more than worthy of the book
Nov 14 2021,positive,dune 2021 is genuinely a pure spectacle of modern film by denis villeneuve with a riveting audio and visual design
Nov 14 2021,positive,a haunting fullyrealized world and time
Nov 14 2021,positive,the action was great  the actors was perfect for their parts  jason mamoa did a fantastic job as duncan
Nov 14 2021,positive,this has to be the best picture ive seen in many many years breathtaking world building faithful to the book as much you can be this big screen adaptation is the one to measure up to for all future book adaptations it got me pulled in from the opening scene right to the end bravo
Nov 14 2021,positive,overall a very well done version of a difficult book series to grasp  i have read some of the books and i still had trouble with the start of the movie
Nov 14 2021,positive,wow i did not expect much from this film growing up as a star wars fan and now realizing there was a lot ripped up from this franchise great performances all around with a stellar cast i can definitely see this being the next giant franchise of our time the continuation of this story cant come soon enough 
Nov 14 2021,negative,dont get the ratings this was probably one of the worse movies in past 60 years poor script nonsensical story line  its the type of movie that makes you feel depressed trying for 2 12 hours hoping there would be something worthwhile in the movie and you didnt waste precious time watching crap timothée chalamet did a good job but there is only so much you can do with garbage
Nov 14 2021,positive,comfortably the best film ive seen in years certainly at the pictures you have to see this at the cinema to enjoy it at its best incredible sound cgi sets design and script i just hope part 2 and 3 if there is one is made and is as good a truly amazing film
Nov 14 2021,negative,while visually stunning and the actors are nicely cast the script and storytelling were slow and off base from the original story written by frank herbert  gone is a fabulous villain is the emperor who was responsible for the betrayal and the once mighty baron is just a subdued floating fat man who could have been so much more considering the actor who was playing him  key characters are left out from the plot im looking at you fayd rautha and the others are weakened when in the written story they are so very much stronger  while i want to love this movie  it is visually amazing to see the size and depth villeneuve went to  i just cannot give it a passing grade as it misses so much in the storytelling to warrant it  i really wanted this to be a great movie considering the impact that dune has had on so many modern day writers  however i am in the minority here as people either havent read the books or just choose to ignore that fact
Nov 14 2021,positive,best sci fi movie in 2021 looking forward to the sequel in 2023
Nov 14 2021,positive,dune is a visual spectacle that manages to adapt frank herberts book to the big screen without getting bogged down with exposition which would bore the watcher however it does suffer from some of its characters not being given enough time to be truly fleshed out and definitely feels like part of a series of films and not something that stands out on its own    denis villeneuve does an excellent jobs of creating a world similar yet different from our own and really transports you into it with a perfect blend of gorgeous visuals and brilliant camera work the main character of paul atreidis played by timotheé chalamet is the most fleshed out character in the whole film with the films basically surrounding his choice to decide the destiny that hell take and finding who he truly it as a result which is an excellent story ark for sure duncan idaho played by jason mamoa plays an excellent mentor figure to paul and is probably one of the best secondary characters in the whole film oscar issac gives a magnificent performance as duke leto atreidis and truly brings out a sense of prestige and nobility but also a man who has found himself caught in a trap that he has no way to escape being given arrakis not out of gratitude but so the emperor could do away with his house by invoking the hostilities between the atreidis and harkonnen speaking of house harkonnen stellen skarsgård gives a monstrous performance as the menacing and unhuman baron harkonnen and the prosthetic work done here has to be honoured as well for bringing this character to life the freman are also interesting and are well fleshed out but most of the other characters go underutilised and as such underdeveloped and the films couldve benefited massively if it had given them more time to be fleshed out    all in the only setbacks i see in this movie are in the development of certain characters which is the only thing holding it back to me but all in all i would suggest you go watch it on the big screen just to witness the visual extravaganza that it is
Nov 14 2021,positive,i want more zendaya but thats not what this film is about it sucks you into this vast desert world that inspired star wars youll see how
Nov 14 2021,positive,special effects were great a little hard to follow the plot
Nov 14 2021,negative,i really didnt get the point
Nov 14 2021,positive,slow but epic  great world building looks  sounds incredible faithful to the source material and left me wanting part 2 asap
Nov 14 2021,negative,this film was gorgeous to watch the sets the costumes the cgi it really looks great unfortunately everything else was second to that and the movie suffered as a result dialogue and action took a back seat to a never ending series of long boring indulgent camera shots when dialogue actually happened it felt more like a character occasionally monologging than a real conversation action lacked impact and never felt meaningful or exiting   pretty but overrated
Nov 14 2021,positive,falls short of what it should have been it had all the ingredients to be a classic but suffered from several issues that cost the film its emotional connection with the audience    i also disliked the directors choice to reframe scenes every 12s when you just want to take in the landscape at times it was jarring as the shot kept changing even though it was showing the same perspective like why just let me enjoy the shot
Nov 14 2021,positive,its a slow burn the effects  were great acting was good but not great
Nov 14 2021,positive,the music editing and storytelling in dune extraordinary
Nov 14 2021,positive,the shots and music were amazing its slow but explains the foundation of the story very well cant wait for the 2nd one and hopefully 3rd
Nov 14 2021,positive,it was definitely not trying to explain everything in 5 minutes and letting the movie flow like life on a grand scale  reading the first few books will help
Nov 14 2021,negative,soooooo boring it was like being torched for 25 hours how can this have high ratings rigged 
Nov 14 2021,positive,the sets look amazing and the actors and actresses all seem decent but i just was so bored it feels like this is supposed to be a tv series there is so much background material
Nov 14 2021,negative,super boring go see something else
Nov 14 2021,negative,if you have read the bookbooks you will be highly disappointed it didnt follow the book well at all i was super disappointed with pc hollywood changing the gender of a main character dr kynes after that it made it hard to enjoy the movie because obviously the aim was not to try to be authentic to the book     rebecca ferguson is a beautiful talented actress but how she portrayed lady jessica was way off lady jessica in the book is a very strong confident woman the movie version was an emotional basket case i would blame the writersdirector for that not her acting ability i like the actor who played paul jason mamoa was solid they didnt build gurneys character enough josh brolin   there was no explanationintroduction to the overall plottheme of the setting of the dune universe such as what a mentat is and does the navigators the sisterhood etc all essential parts of the story to just be blatantly left out the original movie did so much more with so much less and at least did its best to follow the book in the time allowed this didnt tell hardly any of the story and they wasted a whole 2 and a half hours on it maybe if you havent read the bookbooks i have read every book in the dune universe you might kind of like it if you didnt fall asleep through the first half or the last half i honestly dont understand why people rated this movie so high i dont recommend it if you are a dune fan and not really if youre not either
Nov 14 2021,negative,felt like i only watched 20 minutes of a movie the movie felt like it was just a pilot episode of a new tv show the movie was very overhyped and nothing like starwars
Nov 14 2021,positive,cinematography is stunning and really shows how far we have come and helps show off these amazing actors in a brilliant way the plot is slow but seems to be setting up for future movies in the series hopefully the next one is stronger
Nov 14 2021,positive,beautifully shot and scored by the ever amazing hans zimmer i went into this thinking im probably not going to enjoy it as much as other people but i was pleasantly surprised first third is a tad slow and this film is essentially just one long albeit good trailer for the next film that being said you cant help but be pulled into the story and universe building great cast and interesting elements
Nov 14 2021,positive,outstanding  great storyline all the actors were phenomenal  we loved it
Nov 14 2021,positive,excellent telling of the story if a bit slow and ends part one in a strange place
Nov 14 2021,positive,great story great acting great writing and direction felt amazing to just feel what a great cast and good writing can do hollywood needs to take notes from this movie
Nov 14 2021,positive,beautiful movie much better than the original the plot development was somewhat hard to follow at first but it came together by the end of the movie acting was fantastic musical score and cinematography were amazing loved the special effects
Nov 14 2021,negative,lousy dialogue lousy visuals lousy storyboarding lousy acting too  an all around flop
Nov 14 2021,negative,very slow no one in our group understood what was happening came very close to walking out
Nov 14 2021,negative,just as bad as the original
Nov 14 2021,neutral,it was a character introduction movie that is all that i can say never read books or watched original movie so cant compare kept waiting for something important to hapens which doesnt until last 1020min of movie  i am not left with any eagernessreason to continue to part 2 but i will just to finish what i started as a standalone as weak as eternals overhyped  overpraised  both of them
Nov 14 2021,positive,epic movie follows the book well
Nov 14 2021,positive,it was visually stunning and so honest with the source material
Nov 14 2021,positive,i have no idea what was going on but i liked it
Nov 14 2021,positive,nice interesting characters intriguing story interesting spaceship designs  disliked the vague story many things not explained or omitted instead of making on good movie split into parts designed to milk the franchise now viewers have to wait ti see more and off course pay more
Nov 14 2021,positive,well done casting fx script acting direction etc  all served the story  just way too loud with dialogue sometimes too low in mix 
Nov 14 2021,positive,so as you guys have probably heard the visuals for dune are absolutely fantastic the use of wide shots to establish the vastness of not only the planet theyre on itself but also just the vastness of the governing powers is so fantastic the visual effects fit so seamlessly into the world the design for the lighting is wonderful and the design for the costumes throughout this movie stays absolutely phenomenal through and through  the story does get a little complicated the use of some of the flashbacks in the film is a little jarring at times and makes it hard to keep track of everything thats going on at that time theres a lot to take in as its the establishing movie of what i assume is going to be a trilogy and so this interruption while does give us some very needed details can cause the overall story to get a little hard to keep track of  827 pm  i think hans zimmer did an awesome job at tone setting with the music throughout the entirety of the movie i dont think there was a single time where i thought the music was out of place or fell flat in its overall tone for the scene  sound design was also absolutely wonderful with some obvious foley work here and there but with some very wellthoughtout sounds for some objects that obviously dont have sounds like forcefields and such the sound orchestrated for some of the largerscale battle scenes solidified and justified the size of the sounds with explosions having a lot of impact through the film   all in all id probably give it like an 8910
Nov 14 2021,positive,it was long and entertaining
Nov 14 2021,positive,books fans will enjoy but done well enough that fans new to the story will love it too
Nov 14 2021,positive,great cinematography and story line
Nov 14 2021,positive,i loved it my fiancé said she didnt get it
Nov 14 2021,positive,great moviecant wait for part 2
Nov 14 2021,positive,great looking forward for part 2
Nov 14 2021,positive,ethereal and eye opening amazing experience
Nov 14 2021,negative,movie was ok but theatre full of moths and flies made the experience terrible
Nov 14 2021,neutral,complete snorefest with some pretty cinematography
Nov 14 2021,positive,not only does the movie do the book justice but the elements that theyve added which were tiny and subtle actually improved the quality of the movie and push the story forward    im looking forward to the sequel and hopefully they will stop there and not give this movie the hobbit treatment    as a slot fighter i very much appreciated the night lighting scenes however my only gripe would be that it was a little bit faster however if you did that then probably would be dead people so again quite understandable and the story still remains great     but highly recommend this movie this movie will excite every synapse in your brain an electoral physical spiritual its an outstanding movie
Nov 14 2021,negative,to be positive first the costume and set design were cool the character building and the story telling was horrible super slow for the first hour of the movie then some excitement then back to meh guess theyre just planning for a first of a series bc it ended as such tell the story of this family  village  whatever it was a little more so we can cheer for them  feel for them more in the upcoming movies if i even watch anymore
Nov 14 2021,positive,very good story line and acting along with special effects
Nov 14 2021,negative,dont waste your time
Nov 14 2021,positive,greatest movie so far 2021  incredible scenary costume acting its much aprecciated and greaat lenght two hours and halfexcellent must watch
Nov 14 2021,positive,cant wait for the next part 
Nov 14 2021,neutral,i didnt feel engage with the characters that much due to the writing and over dramatic annoying operatic soundtrack i found many of them all dislikable  it was better than the original but still felt long and drawn out
Nov 14 2021,positive,was a solid movie definitely a good to potentially great movie  cant wait to see the next in the series
Nov 13 2021,positive,i loved the visuals music acting it was just the storyline that got confusing at times
Nov 13 2021,neutral,most of the positive reviews i see on here seem to focus only on the technical aspects of the film and not the story and characters which is quite telling if amazing visuals are enough to keep you enthralled then youll enjoy this movie if you want to see a movie with interesting characters and a riveting story youll be disappointed
Nov 13 2021,positive,beautiful and a huge spectacle well worth seeing on the biggest screen you can find would be a shame to not see a continuation
Nov 13 2021,positive,a little long but excellent cinematographyset piecessfx and hans zimmer delivered amazing soundtrack as always other worldly sciif adventure done right
Nov 13 2021,positive,pretty dang good highly enjoyed my time
Nov 13 2021,positive,a film for the engaged audience it certainly isnt the most straightforward film that gives you all of the answers up front which is great for multiple viewings lucky for us this film warrants as many viewings as you can muster the sets and costume were extremely well done the attention to detail the subtle acting when needed and the emotional explosiveness of the cast is used perfectly to convey the tone and keep it consistent throughout the score and sound design are immersive and whole it feels like the world is one unit the stakes and the major beats of the story are well thought out and well executed it was truly a visual treat as well with stunning landscapes excellent use of color and form to frame the shots overall an incredible experience truly cinematic i am very impressed with the cast and crew it was an honor tp see their work
Nov 13 2021,positive,one of the best cinematic experiences i have had in 20 years immaculate sound and score perfect casting amazing cinematography fantastic adaptation of difficult material reminds you of what cinema can accomplish when not weighed down with ideological nonsense and group pandering
Nov 13 2021,positive,better than the david lynch production good pacing time passed quickly without notice
Nov 13 2021,positive,an audiovisual treat after recent years of rather unimpressive cinema finally something worth seeing in the theaters have high hopes for the sequel
Nov 13 2021,positive,its not as good as the first one and the fact that its just 1 part is telling me thatll be a little bit less fun in terms of the speedpacing of movie
Nov 13 2021,positive,it is a must see if you like the dune saga
Nov 13 2021,positive,absolutely incredible a must see in theaters loved it
Nov 13 2021,positive,enjoyed this first of what i suspect will be a series of movies it was high action good story line and very good acting well done and powerful
Nov 13 2021,negative,if i could have given this nil stars i would have done its the first movie i have walked out of in 15 years awful
Nov 13 2021,positive,i thought the casting was generally very good  it is visually beautiful and the acting is good  honestly though if i hadnt already read the books i would have been lost  i think this should have been planned as a threemovie series at least to do justice to the plot and themes presented in dune
Nov 13 2021,positive,what can i say that hasnt already been said its an epic visually stunning mesmerising film im a recent dunereader rather than a lifelong fan but this has done the book justice so glad were getting part 2
Nov 13 2021,positive,excellent cinematography very good acting and stuck to the book
Nov 13 2021,positive,amazing everything about this movie was perfect and its a must see
Nov 13 2021,positive,excellent cast excellent production hans zimmer what more needs to be said an epic movie theatre experience
Nov 13 2021,positive,dune is handsdown one of the best movies i have ever seen in years no spoilers    expansive majestic innovative    everything was so well integrated into an audiovisually satisfying movie with a great emphasis on the characters     loved the vastness of everything loved the grace of spaceship landing and takeoffs loved the innovative design of dragonfly spaceships loved the visually creative combat shields loved the choreography of fight scenes loved how the story of power politics was told in a slowbuilding but deeply intriguing way where a large set of characters were introduced in a wellplaced and logical sequence so understanding the main plot despite the scale of the story was almost effortless sound effects constructively intensified the story while cinematography enhanced the characters    id definitely recommend this movie to anyone and a theatrical experience is a must
Nov 13 2021,negative,the movie dragged along slowly and any story worth telling was overshadowed by unnecessary special effects bad performances  it all starts with the miscast of timothee chalamet as paul which made it impossible to believe that he is the leadermessiah that the freman dreamed of his battle scene was laughable it was defiantly easy to see how george lucas used dune as his source material for his star wars universe only difference is george knew how to tell a story however denis villeneave was not able to do dune justice or tell a story worth watching or even make you care about any of the characters the best scenes were with lady jessica and the reverend mother  i have no interest in seeing dune part 1 again or ever watching  part 2
Nov 13 2021,positive,having living thru the debacle in the 1980sthis is more true to heberts vision  loved it  music too loud and impedes conversation in some places edit better
Nov 13 2021,negative,i felt the movie was very boring  the music score was dark  dull and didnt contribute to the movies overall impact  people refer to the stunning visuals but while they were good every color was pretty much brown tan gray  black  so nothing really beautiful  the slow pace of the movie combined with the music  dreary visuals led to my score  timothee chalamet and rebecca ferguson were both very good but it wasnt enough
Nov 13 2021,positive,the story  and cant wait for next chapter
Nov 13 2021,negative,too long movie the visuals were amazing but  not enough for keep my attention the characters were dull except momoa he did a nice job with his character
Nov 13 2021,positive,complete masterpiece i wish we had more of these kinds of films
Nov 13 2021,positive,beautiful epic and mature the only downside is how much we are left wanting more
Nov 13 2021,positive,whens  the next one out
Nov 13 2021,positive,the scope and scale of the movie is incredible the pacing is steady and strong despite so much exposition constantly being required this was meant to be unfilmable but they did it
Nov 13 2021,positive,absolutely stunning effects and the scenes were very artistic
Nov 13 2021,positive,duna is immediately impressive at first sight for the grandeur that its brilliant director denis villeneuve wants to convey and he succeeds in every aspect whether in its controversial soundtrack in its visual and practical effects and even in the costumes and direction    duna is the second film adaptation of the classic book by frank herbert considered one of the fathers of science fiction i have not read the book to judge his adaptation but we can feel the grandiosity of the story simply by its narrative arcs and always remembering that this dune is part one and was adapted only halfway through the first book that is we still have many stories to live but the script is not perfect not because of its plot itself but because of some narrative choices  i felt a lack of deepening ties between the most important characters in addition to a weak ending in relation to the whole that was being built  although it is not a real ending  another point is a repetition of ideas that work but leave the film a little dragged    visually i thought it was amazing the costume connotations are fantastic especially the feminine ones the makeup is also good the epic and confusing soundtrack by hans zimmer works well at least from my point of view it was clear that villeneuve gave total creative freedom for zimmer to compose the soundtrack sometimes steals some scenes from the movie not necessarily in a good way but the strangeness of the music harmonizes with the grandeur of the scenes at times it even reminded me of the classic akira and about the scenes i thought the work with open shots is fantastic i like constant contemplation closeups villeneuve knows how to work with the camera very well and this is evident in this work every art direction is amazing the only point that for me is not perfect is the photography which permeates with its gray tone throughout the film at times works well and at others we feel like we are missing something like the scenes in dune themselves that called for a warmer photograph another point of discussion is the weak battle scenes it is true that much due to the technology of the dune universe that influences too much at this point but even so the choreographies are weak    the dune cast is very good especially the support one i had a skepticism with the duo timothée chalamet and zendaya but as far as possible they work well but who steals the scene here is rebbeca fergusson who plays a fantastic character one of the pivots of story a broken and menacing figure and the swedish actress delivers a fantastic role by the way the cast full of stars is really good  for a few years ive been saying that denis villeneuve is the best dieter of the new generation  although now hes not so young anymore  the canadian director simply doesnt have a mistake in his career quite the contrary he just has great successes and duna is another one of them  the plot complexity combined with the exquisite direction full of mysticism and details sell the work to perfection grade 910
Nov 13 2021,negative,hocus pocus appropriation of arab culture and islam as some mysterious desert tribe non sense family feud boogey men rituals and incoherent villain values a basic movie for basic people hurry up and be excited for the swelling action music
Nov 13 2021,positive,great new movie    dune loved reading the books many years ago this movie is far from disappointing graphics and special effects where is outstanding actors did a great job portraying the  characters from the story
Nov 13 2021,positive,a great movie by villeneuve and a smart though not accurate or detailed adaptation of the source material     atmospheric a pleasure to watch and rewatch though not advertised as such it is a part one something you learn the moment of the opening credits and its probably the biggest problem of the movie since after act 2 it feels like it was artificially expanded to get at a proper climactic to be continued moment in its defense itd be indeed impossible to finish one movie without going into 335 hours running time which is a hard pill to swallow for studios     the entire atreides cast is magnificent in their roles as well as most of the rest of the cast with jason momoa standing out a little bit  not with a bad performance but with a significantly different tone of voice than the rest
Nov 13 2021,positive,a masterpiece of an adaptation by dennis villeneuvethe writing screenplay direction all are amazingthe cinematography especially stands out for meits flawlessthe first sci fi movie where i didnt doubt the visuals one single timesome of the shots in the film should be framed    wait for part 2 is on
Nov 13 2021,positive,excellent version of the dune story
Nov 13 2021,neutral,epic in look but lacking in many elements of drama i also wondered if this story isnt a bit tired by 2021
Nov 13 2021,positive,perfect for people who loved the book and newbies alike the actor and actress choices for the movie were made for these roles i might have to see it a few more times while its still in theaters
Nov 13 2021,positive,i would consider dune as one of the top three science fiction movies of the past several decades and an astonishing interpretation of the novel
Nov 13 2021,positive,dune looks and sounds amazing it was a little slow and needed more time to explain the universe it is set in hopefully a sequel can deliver more story
Nov 13 2021,positive,as a fan of the book i loved it
Nov 13 2021,positive,one of the best scifi movies of the last 30 years from one of the most visionary director in the business
Nov 13 2021,positive,this is a compelling movie that allows those who have read the book to see it come to life for those that have not read the book it is possible to follow along the plot without getting lost the visual effects and the musical score makes you feel like you are actually there
Nov 13 2021,positive,dune is breathtaking to behold easily the best dune adaptation that exists which i suppose isnt saying much
Nov 13 2021,positive,you wont regret watching it
Nov 13 2021,positive,i dont even understand what i watched
Nov 13 2021,negative,for an overly long movie with very little action they still did a terrible job at developing the plot and any depth at all to the characters
Nov 13 2021,negative,the original film may have been considered a failure because it was too complicated yes you have to concentrate it is now rightfully considered a masterpiece populated by fabulous performances of the worlds best an atmospheric gem    this new film is a dumbed down poor facsimile of the original 20 longer to tell half the story     clunky dialogue wooden acting low quality special effects awful sound effects sampled bagpipes v a proper music score yawn    why do they need to explain whats happening in a scene are audiences and critics really so dumb now    the high audience rating just shows how far cinema has fallen in the last 35 years and how pedestrian the audience lowest common denominator fodder depressing    watch the original for sanitys sake
Nov 13 2021,positive,this was truly a masterpiece it explored rich lore had great origin stories for each character and really made me adore how beautiful new stories can be told i truly enjoyed watching this and felt like i actually walked away learning and experiencing something more than just a movie i must saythe production team and denis villeneuve really did a phenomenal job with dune thank you to all of them for such an awesome experience d
Nov 13 2021,negative,i stayed in the movie for 20 mins after  the previewsvery loud with dating couple on eighther side of me never saw moviethey said only fandango would refund moneyits where i purchased
Nov 13 2021,negative,what is so hard about telling this story this is another miss the music was great the story was loosely butchered the director claims to be a devotee my guess is that the translation he got was truncated or the details he recalls are blurry because several of his other efforts are great    i can see the possibility of 6 episodes from the first 3 books i can see this as wise i doubt that they will come to pass    this was visually austere where is was not so in the book this was dark and desaturated on a planet with no clouds set design was just uninspired and rather plain    calaban looked like scandinavia without trees instead of a warm wet and inviting place like italy brazil or northern california    the glossing over of the shadout mapes  along with all the other female characters  was wasteful  and im an old guy    there was very little investment in jessicas character  her power vigor danger deep affection and the way this reflects on all bene gesserit if jessica were portrayed as a lowborn with sweeping influence and strength  how much more significant her subjugation by gaius helen mohiam   i am not a feminist but this was a opportunity to put big points of many different kinds  narrative and pc social commentary  on the board that was overlooked  why    the writers interpretation of the kidnapping of paul and his mother was abbreviated and rather colorless    there is a marvelous soliloquy for liet kynes that disappeared    this failed in the last fight scene to give us any idea of the culture we are visiting barely touching on the things they value and hold sacred  also it was staged outdoors  wtf    so we have pretty good special effects and lame writing  par for the course stunts are ok and the music is good    we needed to see more investment in duncan idaho too for reasons that will be evident to anyone who read the first six books    i dont think i will live to see another effort at this literary masterpiece    maybe this can be blamed on studio meddling    scifi channel did a much better job
Nov 13 2021,positive,well constructed with lots of background and context at times it felt a bit slow but i will take that well over a rushed version i felt the dune from the 80s was a confusing mess of characters and ideas i mush prefer this version so far and im looking forward to the sequel
Nov 13 2021,positive,epic story has some star wars  some got concepts in it at 2hr 3min just a wee bit long especially since theres gonna be a part two
Nov 13 2021,negative,other than a few action sequences it was boring
Nov 13 2021,positive,brilliant  artful compelling cant wait for part 2
Nov 13 2021,positive,soundtrack great visual affects great  very engaging movie
Nov 13 2021,positive,highly recommend feels like the beginning of a new star wars trilogy
Nov 13 2021,positive,everything about this movie was so well done the casting scenery and soundtrack truly make it a great experience i wish it was one huge movie to just sit and watch because i cant wait until 2023 proud and happy for anyone involved with such an amazing movie
Nov 13 2021,positive,it was good just a tad bit long wished zendaya was in it more other than that i enjoyed it
Nov 13 2021,positive,dune was visually stunning and a joy to sit through i cant wait for the sequel to come out
Nov 13 2021,negative,this movie play this annoying suspense music the entire time horrible plot jumps straight into the middle with no back story 100 dead serious nothing funny or amusing happens the dialogue changes so much its hard to understand and comprehend what the fuck is happening and the actor choices are mediocre at best all around stupid ass movie
Nov 13 2021,positive,good movie some scenes are better in old version especially scene with arm in the box but new one brings some fresh sight
Nov 13 2021,positive,epic this is dune sorry david lynch but denis got it right
Nov 13 2021,positive,i liked the visuals and the fidelity to the original storyline
Nov 13 2021,positive,for those whove read the books this doesnt disappoint
Nov 13 2021,positive,really good movie great perspective of the director denis villeneuve who did an amazing job with the first part of this modernization of the original the movie have his own way of describing the story trough amazing shots of fictional landscaping the actors are solids timothée chalamet offers us an outstanding performance and though as her character doesnt talk that much like most of the characters in fact zendaya is powerful through all of her apparitions the dialogue are not so present and thats enough to understand and follow the story the actions scenes are magnificent and we know that more is coming in the second part   id highly recommend this movie
Nov 13 2021,positive,love the book and the movie handled a complex subject really well
Nov 13 2021,positive,a w e s o m e  epic photography beautiful story amazing soundtrack
Nov 13 2021,positive,within minutes of watching the movie i was hooked amazing scenery believable acting im going to reread the series since i have to wait 2 years til the next installment of the dune series  argh
Nov 13 2021,positive,about the best case scenario for people new to dune and hard core fans like myself
Nov 13 2021,positive,what else could anyone want from a movie read the book first and then you will realize this movie is just meant to be an epic visual to the overwhelming goat sci fi novel that is frank herberts dune thank you denis villeneuve i give you an a for effort and an a for execution 
Nov 13 2021,neutral,it starts out well but as it develops the shortcomings of the cast and the art direction weigh the film down  while the impressive visual effects and lack of internal monologues does carry the film for the first reel the cast cant carry the drama or interest for long
Nov 13 2021,positive,dune the good the bad and the ugly    dune opens with a lengthy sequence of scenes introducing us to duke leto atreides oscar isaac his son paul timothee chalamet and pauls mother jessica rebecca ferguson who is of a secretive order known as the bene gesserit  we meet their trusted retainers and find that they are about to leave their current fief the planet caladan since this is the far future for the rich but dangerous desert planet of arrakis  paul faces a painful test at the hands of lady jessicas former bene gesserit teacher and we begin to find out more about the purposes and powers of that order  upon arriving at arrakis the atreides and their followers quickly work to win over the native freman to gain desert power but before they can consolidate their position disaster strikes  in the aftermath paul and his mother must survive and find a way to regain what they have lost as much as possible     the novel dune was published in the mid60s and is considered by many a classic in the field of science fiction sf  it dealt with the ecology of another world arrakis in a convincing way and to such an extent that it was almost a character in the novel just one aspect of amazing world building by its author frank herbert  i read the book many times first as a teen and most recently last month as an adult on the far side of middle age  so my perspective might be somewhat different from someone who never read the book but be that as it may below is what i call the good the bad and the ugly of this movie     the good  given the scope of the book i wondered if the movie could capture it visually in a convincing fashion and need not have been concerned  the visuals are beautiful with well done cgi for the space ships but more importantly beautifully shot location work seamlessly mixed with more cgi to make you feel like the movie was really filmed on arrakis      the casting by an large seems spot on  some characters like duncan idaho jason momoa look quite different than described in the book but momoa nails the role wonderfully and many others in the case including josh brolin as gurney halleck also get the characters right      finally the movie retains from the book the love and acceptance of the duke toward his son and the willingness to selfsacrifice of many of his men especially duncan idaho  these were bright moments in a film that had many tragic elements to it     the bad  paradoxically one of the best parts of this movie is a bit of a weakness in that it follows the plot of the novel very closely  if you have read the book you will find few surprises and very little missing even if the sequence of scenes or their length and importance are changed a bit  however in so closely following the novel the movie moves quite slow especially in the first hour to the point that i was impatient for something to actually happen  strangely one item from the book that the movie omitted was a dinner party that served to really show what the civilization of the galactic empire and arrakis in particular was like  movies cannot have everything from a novel on the screen if they are to be well done adaptations but that particular event might have been of more help in setting the stage for following action than the all too slow and drawn out scenes on caladan     the ugly  movie reviews are always subjective whatever a reviewer says and this section of mine is particularly subjective as it describes why i found the movie ugly at times that not fun to watch in rereading the book for the first time in 20 years i found it somewhat darker and less pleasant to read than i remembered  one saving grace was the little interludes in which there was humor joy or a better insight into a character that made the book more enjoyable for me in spite of some dark themes   virtually all of these interludes and dialogue are absent from the movie  again they could not possibly all be present but retaining more of this would have given us characters we felt like we knew better and perhaps made for a more pleasant movie   below is an extended quote from the novel that shows how paul began to take on the role of duke and something of the initial nobility of his character an example of something the movie did not retain    kynes stiffened my loyaltys not for sale sire paul stared across the desk at him meeting the cold glare of those bluewithinblue eyes studying the bearded face the commanding appearance a harsh smile touched pauls lips and he said well spoken i apologize kynes met pauls stare and presently said no harkonnen ever admitted error perhaps youre not like them atreides it could be a fault in their education paul said you say youre not for sale but i believe ive the coin youll accept for your loyalty i offer my loyalty to you    totally my son has the atreides sincerity jessica thought he has that tremendous almost naive honorand what a powerful force that truly is she saw that pauls words had shaken kynes this is nonsense kynes said youre just a boy and im the duke paul said im an atreides no atreides has ever broken such a bond kynes swallowed when i say totally paul said i mean without reservation i would give my life for you sire kynes said and the word was torn from him but jessica saw that he was not now speaking to a boy of fifteen but to a man to a superior now kynes meant the word in this moment hed give his life for paul she thought how do the atreides accomplish this thing so quickly so easily    dune was visually stunning followed a well written novel faithfully for the most part and had some well cast actors who did a great job with their roles  however it had issues with pacing moving very slowly in the first hour and perhaps as a result leaving out some important character moments in the later part of the movie
Nov 12 2021,positive,incredible not what i was expecting when i heard it was comparable to star wars excited for part 2 
Nov 12 2021,positive,pros amazing world sound design scenery and characters  cons slow and long i wish i could of waited to see both parts in one sitting    overall high 7
Nov 12 2021,positive,visually this is a great movie contextwise its a missed opportunity speaking of acting timothée hal chalamet drove me asleep several times
Nov 12 2021,neutral,its the kind of movie you wont enjoy at all if you are not a fan of the books or the 80s movie i tried hard to not fall asleep the photography is nice tho
Nov 12 2021,positive,ok flick  love the book just didnt like the adaptation felt that some of the dialogue was forced into wrong scenes the movie was like a puzzle with some of the pieces jammed into incorrect places still the movie was pretty ok
Nov 12 2021,negative,been a while since i sleeped to a movie dune was the perfect movie to do it absolute bullocks
Nov 12 2021,positive,this movie had a really good story and kept in mind to what the book has it may be a little slow for some but you could feel the windup for the second half visuals sounds and characters that was put in it should get an oscar i hope the 2nd half does not disappoint or i will have to come back here to change my rating since this hyped up for part 2 so much
Nov 12 2021,positive,loved the movie a great job of world building but still interesting a little more explanation on house politics would have helped
Nov 12 2021,negative,i was very dissapointed by this movie  it was a bit of a bore if im honest  i love sci fi but im afraid this turgid film fell short in so many ways  the cast mumbles speaks in whispers and often cannot be heard over the pointless and badly balanced background music the plot line dragged  there was no build up of tension  i fail to understand why in a clearly highly advanced civilisation able to conduct interstellar space travel they have sword fights dont use drones in warfare and have piloted helicopters that use antique looking dials and metres that wouldnt look out of place in a 1930s austin 7car  they also used both metric and imperial measures feet in the dialogues  i got very fed up with the cod arab accents used by the sand people this was like watching jupiter rising meets the taliban
Nov 12 2021,negative,there were times in the move it was very dark couldnt really see much details especially when the worm came out of the ground it was very hard to see any details at all i asked my friends whether they experienced that and they said they did not my fiance and i both thought the movie was very dark in lighting at time i would like my money back or watch it again in a better theater or maybe in imax
Nov 12 2021,negative,its a simply boring and uninteresting movie if you want to lose your interest and fall asleep within the first 30 minutes its the best choice
Nov 12 2021,positive,this is a must see in the theatre do not  see it on the tv great special effects interesting world building its part one of two so expect a lot of unanswered questions
Nov 12 2021,positive,awesome movie saw it three times already
Nov 12 2021,positive,great film cant wait to see part 2
Nov 12 2021,negative,i found it pretentious and all but incomprehensible characters are interminably making portentous sentences but the force of the statements is lost because they are so common id guess it is well intentioned but very pompous and bombastic
Nov 12 2021,positive,beautifully made and captures the essence of the story i dont think it couldve been done any better
Nov 12 2021,positive,visually stunning at times but storyline never got out of second gear  after watching this i said to myself is that it
Nov 12 2021,positive,the beautiful landscape and the soundtrack will surely take you to the planet of arrakis even if we could expect a fast action movie the slowness of the scenes put you in a gripping suspense  really good actor particularly chalamet which show us all his talent must see
Nov 12 2021,positive,dune is a window into a kind of film that slowly takes you into a new world the pacing and imagery remain similar to the original film while keeping technological distances for many a slow film for me a film that builds up slowly generating emotions little by little and not a constant bath of meaningless impressions that they are trying to get us used to dune is going to be a sci fi classic and i hope that many directors will copy this old style of films where the immersion is gradual but leaves you satisfied if you have the patience to understand it
Nov 12 2021,positive,i loved it great rendition of herberts amazing book
Nov 12 2021,negative,this is dope as fuk sound effects and cgi are so impressive and director did a spectacular shots thoughout the movieit involves you to experience their world  hanz zimmer is next generation of work going on keep it up
Nov 12 2021,neutral,bored  a lot talk short on  knowing this part 1
Nov 12 2021,positive,a genuine cinematic masterpiece    faced with the herculean task of adapting herberts novel villeneuve manages to masterfully balance the dune universes intense worldbuilding with the intimate story of a boy and his mother    first and foremost this film feels like a cinematic gift to villeneuves younger scifi loving self  and we the viewer are just fortunate to be able to share in the experience
Nov 12 2021,positive,this movie was pretty faithful to the book
Nov 12 2021,positive,beautifully done visually and musically but unfortunately too slow plotwise for my taste i also dont like it when it takes multiple movies to tell one story  this movie is only part i of the first book of a trilogy so itll take at least 5 or 6 movies to finish the whole trilogy  youre warned
Nov 12 2021,positive,as a fan of the books i enjoyed the movie immensely without getting fussy about some differences the technology is portrayed incredibly well and the differences between fremen culture great houses as well as the forces of the emperor are portrayed well i wasnt sure about the casting at first but as the characters developed i liked them more and more left me wanting the next movie now
Nov 12 2021,positive,i really wanted to love this film but i couldnt help but feel like there was something of a baitandswitch when i realized i was watching a film that was clearly the first act of a much larger story
Nov 12 2021,negative,its pretentious long but worse than all that its boring shame disjointed  unlikeable characters in pointless situations visuals were nice but this movie is almost unwatchable i cant imagine anyone who is not a fan of the book to care enough to sit through it
Nov 12 2021,positive,just like other bookstomovies this tries catching us up on chapters of politics factions lore and world building as fast as it can while sacrificing character motivations
Nov 12 2021,negative,the plagiarism of just about every classic sci fi is astonishing even throwing in the brando temple scene from apocalypse now  its very grandiose in visuality and to be expected given the budget as previously mentioned it is a bit of a con job as this is the inception to the series of movies to follow
Nov 12 2021,positive,amazing movie which is brilliantly directed by denis villeneuve which for me is the best adaptation of the book
Nov 12 2021,positive,love this story telling it feels like you submerged in to the world of arakis
Nov 12 2021,positive,the dune is the best movie i had watched for a long time this is not a movie this is an attraction of impressions while watching it it feels like a movie embraces you with its picture and music    music is a story that has to be discussed separately i got the impression what if the screen was blank i would understand whats going on just only listening to the music    in this movie i can say i believed every word that was said and every emotion that was shown
Nov 12 2021,positive,takes a while for the story to build but about half way through it all clicks into place and starts to kick ass
Nov 12 2021,positive,beautiful movie better than expected
Nov 12 2021,positive,the movie was a little slow in the beginning and just when i wanted more it ended  i really hope the movie is successful because i really want to see dune part ii
Nov 12 2021,positive,followed the book really well but very cinematic
Nov 12 2021,positive,this was a great movie way better than the original and the tv series loved it cant wait for part 2
Nov 12 2021,positive,this movie is outstandingthe story lines was well written and the actors were superb
Nov 12 2021,positive,while its story is obviously and slowly building up to its eventual sequel a great cast and fantastic visuals keep dune afloat
Nov 12 2021,positive,true to the book and the character portrayals are believable  the special effects enhanced the movie and did not steal attention away for the story
Nov 12 2021,negative,boring slow random its was one of the worst movies ive ever seen
Nov 12 2021,positive,i loved the scenery and the acting is phenomenal it is a beautiful film and it is full of suspense and you never know whats going to happen next it is executed amazingly and it is the best film ive seen in theaters in a very long time
Nov 12 2021,positive,the scope and beauty of this movie must be seen all actors do a fantastic job particularly chalamet he is proving to be one of the top actors of his generation it could have been five stars if they had found a way to deepen the worldbuilding a bit within the set time its not    supposed to be a space movie per say but we never really see them traveling in space we also do not really see typical life of civilians outside of the military and rulers we get that they are in charge but of whomtherefore we cannot fully appreciate the scope of the dune world although it gets pretty close
Nov 12 2021,neutral,i was so disappointed with this movie i felt that if i hadnt read the book i wouldnt have a clue what was going on and the movie was unnecessarily dark the 1984 movie did so much better at character development and at making everything so much clearer
Nov 12 2021,positive,i liked the rich story plot from the original book the acting  the graphics there is a lot of nonaction scenes but still very interesting if you read the book
Nov 12 2021,positive,phenomenal cant wait for part 2
Nov 12 2021,positive,the whole movie was phenomenal my favorite part was the voice i enjoyed the entire movie start to finish
Nov 12 2021,positive,amazing movie stays true to the novel and keeps you wanting more the whole movie i have seen it 3 times in theaters this week its that good cant wait for part 2
Nov 12 2021,positive,really good but a lot of changes from original one part was missing really disappointed about that
Nov 12 2021,negative,unwatchable bad casting even worse acting poor cinematography movie is 70 dark it does not do justice to the story
Nov 12 2021,negative,yikes how many depressed people were in this movie they were all depressed this movie did not capture the fear of the san worms in the book not the desperation of the addicted ferem wow  walked out
Nov 12 2021,positive,this movie is amazing i think they did a wonderful job adapting since very difficult material to the big screen with the exception of a few things that i think they shouldve included this movie is a damn near perfect rendition
Nov 12 2021,positive,cinematography aircrafts costume design actors
Nov 12 2021,positive,best movie i had seen  since going back to the movies since pandemic can wait for second part do yourself a favor and watch it on i max 
Nov 12 2021,negative,did not have enough story to it mostly special effects and mood music and close ups of actors faces
Nov 12 2021,positive,the film was beautifully filmed and the actors were terrific  the locations were tremendous im very interested in seeing part 2 my one criticism is that i had trouble understanding the various tribes and their names
Nov 12 2021,positive,awesome spectacle to behold the acting is incredible
Nov 12 2021,positive,not a whole lot better to me than the 1984 version  has its moments
Nov 12 2021,positive,spectacular movie even more so if youre familiar with the story
Nov 11 2021,positive,sound visuals world building and tension all amazing as someone with no history with dune this has got me hooked  that harvester scene though
Nov 11 2021,positive,october 21 2021    denis villeneuves dune presents a dilemma for the film critic on the one hand its a patient polished and sophisticated science fiction saga one thats wellperformed and the story and emotion of which the filmmakers and cast take seriously its their collective belief in dedication to and intelligent interpretation of frank herberts 1965 novel that will encourage fans of herberts work to respond to this ambitious film in kind i recently read dune and as the movie played out i found myself once again getting caught up in it otherworldliness its atmosphere its mythology its politics and its smart yet vulnerable characters at the end of this twoandahalfhour part one installment i was grateful villeneuve and the studio decided to split dune into two parts and take their time with it because theres a lot to absorb and appreciate     on the other hand and this is where the dilemma comes into play i can see dune despite its beauteous visuals superb production values and strong performances losing viewers who havent read the book leaving them feeling withdrawn disassociated and perhaps even betrayed in fact i think many nonreaders will find themselves just sitting there bored at first asking the question why should i care about these characters or whats happening onscreen     it would be a fair question because as much as i felt villeneuve and his fellow screenwriters jon spaihts and eric roth adapted herberts piece in all the right ways for the big screen i cant say they make the story immediately accessible to anyone unacquainted with the source even i who read the book just this year was hoping the movie would offer a highlevel introduction to the dune universe think scrolling subtitles as it is its put upon the audience to figure out the dynamics of this faroff world which isnt necessarily a bad thing but it will likely put newcomers in a mild state of consternation    to be fair all this speaks to the perplexing nature of the material itself which print makes more digestible because we have the luxury of rereading pages and passages parsing words and connecting the names of people and places through simple spelling when it comes to the cinema however the fastpaced nature of the medium requires filmmakers to coddle viewers more lest they tune out and unfortunately i think dune sets itself up for that at least for its first act    this wouldnt be the first time a filmed dune failed to connect with moviegoers david lynch wrote and directed his own version in 1984 and following a tumultuous production it too had a difficult time winning over anyone unfamiliar with herberts book indeed lynchs polarizing film garnered mostly negative reviews with many critics citing it as ugly convoluted and generally unpleasant     ive no doubt villeneuves film will avoid the same drastic fate what with the level of care and detail he and his team have given it but as coherent as villeneuve and editor joe walker try to make the layered and extravagant narrative it cant escape some degree of incomprehension theres simply a lot to process which is probably why the book came with a glossary of characters places and terms that readers could easily reference     movie watchers obviously dont have the same tool at their disposal so its probably inevitable any attempt to adapt dune for the cinema will result in some viewer puzzlement and while i do see this is a flaw on the filmmakers part as i do think they could have devised a smoother more welcoming approach toward indoctrinating viewers into this universe i also think its a mild enough shortcoming that even nondune enthusiasts can still be made to care about the happenings of the plot and characters it may take their enduring the first act but it can be done    with that said where and what is dune essentially in the year 10191 humans have spread out across various planets and split off into great houses these house factions fall under the greater imperium and rulership of padishah emperor shaddam corrino iv who despite playing a vital role doesnt make an appearance in this first installment the story begins shortly after emperor corrino has charged duke leto oscar isaac of house atreides to relocate from his home planet of caladan and oversee arrakis aka dune an arid desert planet that holds the most soughtafter substance in the universe a mélange simply referred to as spice which is literally the spice of life for some and the chemical makeup of which is integral for space travel     by sending leto to arrakis the emperor knowingly usurps the planet from the ruling house harkonnen which happens to be house atreides chief rival led by the bald overweight and essentially immobile baron stellan skarsgård the harkonnen are an angry vindictive manipulative bunch and the complicated history between them and atreides immediately sparks conflict on arrakis    bearing witness to the troubling politics and trying to find his own place in all the chaos is letos precocious 15yearold son paul timothée chalamet the central hero of dune pauls trepidation and uncertainty about moving to arrakis coincides with his dreams about a mysterious girl and his disturbing visions of a future war all the while hes trying to harness the powers bestowed upon him by his mother jessica rebecca ferguson who is the dukes concubine but notyet wife jessica is a member of the bene gesserit a group of female mystics with unique skills not unlike the jedis in star wars for instance she can hijack impervious peoples minds and she has passed this voice and other gifts onto her son who has not yet mastered them    just as paul receives mental instruction from jessica he undergoes physical and combat training from the dukes military aids including duncan idaho jason momoa gurney halleck josh brolin and dr yueh chang chen while accompanying his father he learns about the history and constitution of arrakis from liet kynes sharon duncanbrewster the imperial paleontologist who immediately detects pauls unique intuition and leadership skills shes not the only one because in an earlier scene pauls will power is put to the test by jessicas mentor reverend mother mohiam charlotte rampling to whom paul confesses his dreams of chani zendaya a member of the fremen the native and resourceful people of arrakis who believe paul to be the savior who will ultimately restore arrakis as a lush verdant paradise    ive thrown a lot at you but without giving away too many other details events unfold in the way of assassination attempts betrayals kidnappings sacrifices long treks across vast desert landscapes and potentially fatal encounters with giant sandworms all of these will determine whether paul fulfills his destiny and even though were not quite sure what that is the developments and conflicts that ensure feel right home in a scifi saga of this sort in fact one can easily see the parallels between pauls journey and his fellow genre brethren not least luke skywalker in star wars and neo in the matrix paul is your typical ignorant hero who in a manner of speaking must learn the ways of the force and opens his mind interestingly because pauls story came out first in 1965 it may have been his formation that shaped the other archetypes wed encounter so profusely later    whats remarkable about dune is that despite the plethora of other and more popular stories herberts novel likely inspired the still movie feels fresh and challenging yes it can be confusing at times especially at the beginning but once story focuses more on the characters instead of the plot it obtains an emotional resonance and we begin to care about the people and their circumstances on a deeper level    villeneuve is a director who consistently prioritizes the humanity of his projects even those with high concepts such as blade runner 2049 and arrival and here he once again allows his actors time to respond to their perilous situations while the actors in turn genuinely respond to their predicaments theres weight and dimension behind their expressions anxieties and insecurities especially those of chalamet and ferguson for instance when paul and jessica find themselves lost in the desert and realize theyll have to imitate the fremen to survive we gain a real sense of their fear and exhaustion and its details such as these that elevate dune beyond just a standard scific actioner oddly enough it feels relatable    whats more is the screenwriters keep intact the contemporary and historical parallels between the ongoings of the dune universe and our own which herbert infused throughout his book with some of the more obvious examples being the ramifications of colonialism political corruption and environmental degradation caused by war and technology dune is both subtle and vocal about these subjects which will no doubt give viewers something to think about and discuss afterward even if they do just skim the surface    at 150 minutes dune is perhaps too long villeneuve is clearly in love as he should be with greig frasers cinematography patrice vermettes production design and the special effects all of which render beautifully but a good 15 minutes could have been trimmed by cutting some of the solely picturesque shots to keep the story moving along more fluidly    still this is very good movie bold technically supreme sometimes poignant and related with conviction and enthusiasm i can accept its not for everyone despite all its virtues but even viewers who are not on board with dune can rightly accept the filmmakers have done their due diligence to make an ambitious and important film or at least as important as any science fiction film about dueling tribes and giant sandworms vying for power and territory 8000 years in the future could be this movie took a long time to make it to theaters but it was well worth it with this first installment now complete and its heart humanity and exquisiteness fully realized my hope and belief is that part two tentatively scheduled to be released in last 2023 will be just as engaging if not more
Nov 11 2021,positive,some parts dragged on like his flying in the storm and  he was treated like a child who didnt care at his age it seemed a bit sparse in population like they didnt have enough actors in the later scenes
Nov 11 2021,positive,they kept what were multifaceted and a bit hard to follow sub plots in the book to a minimum  except maybe the bene gesserit  which may be further fleshed out in the sequel what was in the movie was pretty my much how i remember the book
Nov 11 2021,positive,dune was an excellent movie while my wife and i havent read the books and knew almost nothing dune did a good job of explaining things and kept us engaged the only critique we have is that the score seemed to be too loud people complained that the music was too loud or weird but i thought it fit it was just too loud at times we are looking forward to the second one
Nov 11 2021,positive,fantastic film really nice telling of the story definitely recommend
Nov 11 2021,positive,great movie enough said 
Nov 11 2021,positive,fantastic score cgi was incredible
Nov 11 2021,positive,i was scared to watch this as i liked the original but wow this was such a great film and absolutely worth the watch for anyone looking for some escape from life for a few
Nov 11 2021,positive,very nice you want to have some knowledge prior but now i cant wait to read the book and rewatch
Nov 11 2021,positive,a cinematic spectacle on a grand scale but also with plenty of space for the characters to develop and draw you in to their struggles
Nov 11 2021,positive,a good lead into the series for those that dont know the story
Nov 11 2021,positive,absolute epic story and cinematic experience highly recommend
Nov 11 2021,positive,great history and great production
Nov 11 2021,negative,well its not as boring as the original of 1984 but 155 minutes is surely one and half hour too long for this story thus making it for the most part boring as well i in fact dozed off a few times though i watched it at 4 in the afternoon not because i was tired the visuals are naturally amazing especially beautiful desert scenery real and virtual and a few decent battles pep up the story but i think a 2 12 desert walk is more exciting than this movie too much of the movie indicates that dune originally was a lousy spinoff attempt of the star wars movie even showing near identical army scenes and very similar characters worst of all the beginning of the movie makes it clear that this is only part one having more movies to follow up   one can definitely skip this flick 4 12 of 10 points
Nov 11 2021,positive,well acted great cinematography should be some academy award winners in this one must see in the theater
Nov 11 2021,positive,a little slow at times and a bit long but excellent otherwise does a great job of recreating herberts universe
Nov 11 2021,positive,first of all its not a film for everyone its not a swashbuckling laser movie like the star wars sequel trilogy but its better the first half is slow but you keep going due to the fantastic visuals and worldbuilding the second half is even better almost has the tone of the tomorrow war with the protagonists encountering new challenges constantly but yknow its a good movie ending is abrupt though may be meant to be that way
Nov 11 2021,positive,good movie they have a lot of explaining and new ideas at once and unlike eternals it works   waiting for the sequel
Nov 11 2021,positive,i liked every single thing about this movie  what really surprised me were the beautiful  suites and dresses that the cast wore also  the closeup shots with the blurred  background looked so stunning on the big  screen
Nov 11 2021,positive,visually striking movie  its hard to remake a classic  nicely done
Nov 11 2021,positive,rival this scifi i dare you cant wait to see part two of this movie men just cannot comprend the dragon fly style flyer jet tin tiny wat ever bottom line great movie saw it and yes i like it
Nov 11 2021,negative,slow paste slow building the performance of the actors are good and the cinematography are good and the sound is freaking great super super loud great score by hanz zimmer and lastly the dialogue i cant understand the dialogue
Nov 11 2021,positive,visually phenomenal great setup for great universe
Nov 11 2021,positive,loved the movie lots of action and a great story line
Nov 11 2021,positive,art sound photography and acting right on the poetic tone of dune
Nov 11 2021,positive,very pretty in a severe kind of way but a tad ponderous and slow
Nov 11 2021,positive,did not expect to like this movie because i found the previous version weird and hard to follow this version does a great job of introducing the characters and drawing you in to the story it was really mesmerizing it seemed to end just as it was really getting started looking forward to chapter 2 
Nov 11 2021,negative,unfortunately to me this film was the first of many and as such failed to give a proper payoff to the first film of the franchise  great actors wonderful story beautifully shot but unfortunately an hour too long and not my kind of movie
Nov 11 2021,positive,one of the best movies from 2021 wished more zendya tho
Nov 11 2021,positive,i loved the movie as it is in line with the book and looks stunning but if i knew it would end as it did i would have waited to see it in one go the movie set things up but stops at an unbelievable moment else i would have given it 5 stars
Nov 11 2021,positive,stunning film this movie is so well made while it was pretty long it held my interest would definitely watch again 
Nov 11 2021,negative,slow battle scenes were unsatisfying nothing really going on until the end
Nov 11 2021,positive,excellent cinema on all accounts extraordinary film 
Nov 11 2021,positive,way to slow more dialog needed only half the moviesequels or two to followbah humbug
Nov 11 2021,positive,absolutely stunning    while it struggled at times with the truly unwieldy source material the cinematography was impressive the love for the work was clearly put in and the compromises that were to put dune on the big screen were not very tangible    as an avid fan of the books and the universe this has the potential to be the start of something similar to jacksons lotr adaptation although dune clearly remains much more loyal to the source material whenever possible
Nov 11 2021,positive,good movie but i missed a bunch of dialogue idk why but sometimes i just couldnt understand what they were saying
Nov 11 2021,positive,great movie cant wait for part 2
Nov 11 2021,positive,i liked the movie a lot a little long for whats in it but i recommend plus i hear the second one will be a lot better so might as well watch this one
Nov 11 2021,positive,quite overwhelming and relentless and i could have used some humorous or tender moments but wildly exciting exotic thrilling throughout truly incredible visual and sound design it truly conveyed a sense of alienness and awe eagerly awaiting the second installment
Nov 11 2021,positive,this movie was so well made and very much reflected the book which nerds like me love really exciting the characters were relatable and the cinematography was stunning
Nov 11 2021,positive,absolutely phenomenal movie
Nov 11 2021,positive,a masterpiece i was a big fan of the original movie and books so i was pleasantly surprised the scenery was simply perfect i cant wait for part 2
Nov 11 2021,positive,i went to the movies because my boyfriend is a fan of the books with no prior knowledge of the story and absolutely loved it a true masterpiece everyone should enjoy on the big screen you wont regret it
Nov 11 2021,positive,strong cast great performances visually stunning from start to finish excellent movie worth seeing in theaters
Nov 11 2021,negative,saw it on hbomax  the movie is long and boring  shot in a color palate of browns and when anything is not brown it is black  sound was rotten when anyone was speaking  close captioning is a must but the sounds of machinery are loud and clear  the plot holes are annoying  we are told over and over the house of atrides is powerful but apparently so incompetent it cant secure its own noble family  it only takes the family physician to destroy the whole security system  paul is told by his mother he is destined to be the kwisatz haderach but the poor guy or the audience isnt given a clue as to what this means  when paul and his mother are captured they are so valuable it is ordered they are to be kept alive but are given to thugs who plan to kill them  they finally escape march aimlessly through desert happen to met up rescuers and paul becomes a man when he kills a man in a duel  how cliche  the end but of course there is no resolution because this will be a fanchise
Nov 11 2021,positive,the visuals were very well done
Nov 11 2021,negative,this was one of the worst movies ive seen in a long time it was dark hard to follow and it didnt seem to have any direction
Nov 11 2021,positive,while it is a long movie it held my interest most of the time i would watch this movie again
Nov 11 2021,positive,opulent majestic and absorbing denis villeneuves latest epic has the kind of visual splendor imaginative worldbuilding and emotional weight to suggest we are witnessing a landmark in sciencefiction cinema hans zimmers score is robust and immersive the central and minor performances have real gravitas the costuming is exquisite it is a stunning achievement that promises exciting things to come on the sunkissed desert horizon
Nov 11 2021,positive,this story is very difficult to translate into movie format  definitely the most visually impressive of all the dune interpretations thus far  other than that i was bored  probably because ive read the book and seen the other moviesshows and knew exactly what was going to happen
Nov 11 2021,positive,most of what i saw on the movie its pretty close to what i imagined visually you can feel the cruelty of this universe as its described on the books looking forward to see the next one
Nov 11 2021,positive,absolutely brilliant  a must see  thoughtful and faithful adaptation of the original source material  cannot wait for the next installment
Nov 11 2021,positive,i love the david lynch movie but this is a very worthy successor arguably even better looking than 2049 an exceptionally high bar and deftly handles the extraordinarily challenging source material
Nov 11 2021,negative,i did not care for a single character in the movie nothing really had impact especially major characters dying only redeeming qualities are the imperials aesthetic and the score
Nov 11 2021,positive,pretty good but slow paced
Nov 11 2021,positive,movie stayed true to the book  very enjoyable
Nov 10 2021,positive,i have so far seen this movie three times mostly because the only way to experience this film is on as big a screen as you can find with a cinema sound system if youre watching at home on hbo max youre missing out go read the book instead because this is a film that demands the theatre experience    while a fan of the novel ive taken those who havent read the book more than a little concerned about whether they would enjoy it converts all     im talking people who hate scifi and they loved this movie a testament to denis craft and herberts story    this is truly a cinematic masterpiece the visuals the sound the acting the fact the story is so compelling is the cherry on top of a sundae thats already packed with all the best ingredients    my only regret was that i only got to see it in imax once lousy eternals    go see this masterclass of film
Nov 10 2021,negative,too long too slow and too loud
Nov 10 2021,negative,slow confusing story line very disjointed
Nov 10 2021,positive,i have mixed reactions to this the cinematography and set and landscape designs ill give 45 music 355 casting and acting and storytelling 35 my overall score is thus 355 good but not as good as david lynchs 1984 version
Nov 10 2021,positive,timmy killed it but it was longer than needed 
Nov 10 2021,positive,if youre familiar with dune at all you should find this relatable and enjoyable let me say this i absolutely loved david lynchs 1984 version it was a massive undertaking with an amazing cast impressive special effects for its time and seemed to have everything going for it   but i digress   this version may be a little difficult to follow if youre not familiar with the overall story 1984 had the narrations asides and animations depending on the version you come across to further explain the minute details   this version seems to assume that you already know whats happening or going to happen   it moves along pretty nicely and definitely leads to a suspenseful buildup we have heard a lot of talk of emperor shaddam iv but still havent seen him think star wars episodes 4 and 5 with a lot of talk of emperor palpatine but no real sight of him until episode 6  the cast was amazing and the scenery was beautiful this is definitely a mustsee for any duneenthusiast even if youre not its still definitely worth a watch but you may be a little lost hopefully youll have someone with you who can help explain and describe some of the background to you it will make for a good aftermovie chat over food or drinks
Nov 10 2021,positive,great job of bringing herberts universe to life
Nov 10 2021,positive,sensitively adapted book great film despite an abrupt ending hope they will make a second film with the same cast and director
Nov 10 2021,negative,if you go into this movie without knowing anything about it the movie did a pretty terrible job of explaining it didnt create much connection to any characters imo it had good visuals that was about it i cant see how this movie was rated this high
Nov 10 2021,positive,loved the visuals of this movie  everythign looks lilke its an actual place and not a movie set the storytelling is doing great translatign the book into a good movie not just trying to put it out there scene for scen with teh dialog updated to reflect that  all of he characters are more acceable and more real  i look forward to the next part
Nov 10 2021,positive,scifi masterpiece if you got bored at this movie there are plenty of bland marvel superheroes movies out there for you to watch
Nov 10 2021,negative,walked out in an hour

Nov 10 2021,negative,great movie if you want to go to sleep 
Nov 10 2021,positive,great story the turn of events was awesome the music and the montage were stunning but it was too long without an action and without the element of surprise i wont say it was predictable but it was little bit in my sight  anyway ive to wait the sequel to make a final judgment either if they nailed it or rotten it
Nov 10 2021,positive,i loved this movie i am looking forward to part 2to be fair i did have a history with the original
Nov 10 2021,positive,this movie was terrific  i loved the character development and the visual effects and cinematography was amazing  it wasnt just a cgi fest but good acting as well cant wait for part two
Nov 10 2021,negative,for me this movie was a major letdown so much was left out of it that was in the original version of the movie the original version of the movie for me will always outshine this one this was also the worst excuse ive ever had for staying up till 5 in the morning to watch a movie i am ashamed to say that i actually saw this movie
Nov 10 2021,positive,visually stunning the scale of everything is immense good fidelity to the feel of the novel sountrack by hans zimmer sets your teeth on edge sandworms melange

Nov 10 2021,positive,good looking movie  but frustrating it doesnt really end but you have to wait for next instalment
Nov 10 2021,positive,stunning visuals great acting for the most part and it leaves you wanting more even after 25 hours helps if you have read the first few chapters of the book
Nov 10 2021,positive,one of the best movies i saw on my whole life     if continued with the same quality the series could be the next lord of the rings
Nov 10 2021,positive,definitely worth full price in the theatre
Nov 10 2021,negative,great visuals but the movie was very slow and it didnt have me engaged too much
Nov 10 2021,positive,excellent movie really stunning interpretation of all of the difficult to express concepts from the dune book really impressively done felt like they took artistic license in the right places when translating the book into the movie
Nov 10 2021,positive,instant classic this is just the beginning
Nov 10 2021,positive,tons of key plot points glossed over to make 30 minutes of the movie just slow mo vision music glances of chalamet and visions with no meaning
Nov 10 2021,positive,denis likes this genre quite good at it too though havent read the novel still find the portrayal riveting also captivated by the distinctive characters and delicate descriptions essential for an epic story it reminds me the beginning of got so i guess good stories are alike timothees performances are as always ingenious interesting music score choice from zimmer
Nov 10 2021,negative,omg if you hadnt read the book or at least the lead on rt youd have had no idea what the movie was about  explosions bangbang shootem upno substance whatsoever  agonizing to sit through
Nov 10 2021,positive,what a beautifully shot film denis villeneuves vision for this film was everything i had hoped and expected highly recommend
Nov 10 2021,negative,the worst movie ive ever seenit was hard to stay till the end
Nov 10 2021,positive,i really enjoyed it a lot of set up for more movies but i really enjoyed it
Nov 10 2021,positive,cool music cool effects acting was ok good sci fiaction im glad i went
Nov 10 2021,positive,dune is an intriguing movie with good dialogue but some stretches of the movie can feel pretty stale the acting my timothy was pretty impressing and convincing he delivered a good performance but some things can be noted the pacing of certain scenes are affected by the way timothy portrays his character causing certain parts of the movie to feel a little out of place due to his emotions feeling forced overall the run time is what affects this movie the most as i notice certain parts couldve been cut out to make the movie more cohesive
Nov 10 2021,positive,excellent movie hollywood finally got dune right
Nov 10 2021,positive,loved this movie great acting amazing sound and visuals cant wait for part 2
Nov 10 2021,positive,this movie has much meaning to it love it can wait to see part two
Nov 10 2021,positive,pretty good kind of confusing at times awesome cgi
Nov 10 2021,positive,the locations were gorgeous wow those sand dunes great acting and of course the wonderful story
Nov 10 2021,positive,yo im dying for the next part everything about this movie was good i havent watched the original dune so i didnt know what to expect but now im into it
Nov 10 2021,positive,adrenaline filled and non stop action cant wait for part 2
Nov 10 2021,positive,this was just a teaser to part 2 waiting for the next one
Nov 10 2021,positive,i had expectations coming in a denis villeneuve movie and theyve all been met with james cameron taking forever to release his next movie avatar 2 weve been lacking a top level scifi movie director we need denis villeneuve and hes been delivering dune was extremely immersive and it was a deep pleasure to see it in the cinema we could feel the engines of the aircrafts in our seats timothée chalamet surprised me in this role hes pretty well cast many young actors with his build would struggle looking as tough and confident as he did as paul overall this is a movie that i might rewatch in a few years and ill be waiting in line for the sequels
Nov 10 2021,positive,good start of the movie
Nov 10 2021,negative,slow pacing and flat definitely just a movie designed to set up sequels i kept waiting for the climax of the film and i still dont know what the climax was supposed to be this may only be the beginning but it will be the end for me as it did not do enough to keep me interested in sequels to the film 
Nov 10 2021,positive,i actively expected to hate this movie i thought it would be too long too pretentious too melodramatic and too slowim very happy to admit i was wrong on all counts but one its still too longbut damnit its too good im fully invested well done 
Nov 10 2021,positive,dun dun dune this has star power and a monstrous plot 55 desert creatures
Nov 10 2021,negative,disliked hard to follow didnt have much of a plot
Nov 10 2021,positive,the adaptation weve all been waiting for beautifully shot well paced gorgeous score nicely acted and already anticipating the second film to be released true scifi fans should appreciate this film for exactly what it is and enjoy it
Nov 10 2021,negative,too disjointed and noisy very hard to hear dialog  needed subtitles will not waste time to see dune 2
Nov 10 2021,positive,the kickstart to a series that will become a monument to storytelling and scifi for future generations perfect retelling of the book and reinvigorates a genre begging for an update 
Nov 10 2021,positive,i didnt read the books but was very much into the 20002003 miniseries on scifi channel that i still recommend stuff like this just isnt being made anymore with the closest modern thing maybe being the expanse and also had the recent displeasure of watching the original 1984 film wtf  was that    dune 2021 is still exactly the slowburn atmospheric space opera it was intended to be but now with modern art direction and cinematography that really pushes those elements     granted this first installment doesnt work much as a standalone film and is very setup heavy for a sequel however i liked the liberties it took with storytelling and my memory is foggy but it also made the narrative easier to follow than previous iterations    i feel the color tones used really did a disservice in convincing me how incredibly hot uninhabitable and valuable water is on arrakis the film insists on informing me of these things but the super muted and cool tones and lack of heat waves on camera were unconvincing villeneuve was so focused on creating this ambience of a grounded bleak political landscape that it feels like he neglected the immersion of a super heated desert    i appreciated that the film focused on setting the stage on arrakis but not seeing even a glimpse of the emperor andor the spacing guild felt like omitting huge players in the political narrative and world building    anyway a very good movie otherwise if you like slow burn dramatic space operas with heavy lore i hope it does well and isnt forgotten like bladerunner 2042 would be a great shame if the unconfirmed sequels not made
Nov 9 2021,positive,i loved the first dune movie  this new take blew me out of the water   visually stunning to me it was fast paced true to the herbert novel and i cannot say enough about perfectly chosen cast  going back to the theatre to see it once more
Nov 9 2021,positive,so good i had to watch it in theaters twice still slapped as hard the second time
Nov 9 2021,positive,realy enjoyed this film going back to see it a second time it has inspired me to read the books and i look forward to any future films that come from this film
Nov 9 2021,positive,its rare to see a movie as accurate to the pages of its source as this one and even more rare to have denis villeneuves expertise added to it its beautifully done
Nov 9 2021,positive,just finished the book right before seeing the movie was completely blown away by this adaptation reminds me of when i first saw the fellowship of the ring in theaters but this is more accurate to the source material
Nov 9 2021,positive,having read the books and watched the original movie with sting and kyle mclachlan i was ambivalent about the remake as with all the other 80s remakes i thought this would mess up the story for the directors own spin i was very pleasantly surprised at how this turned out a huge fan of jason momoa  i was once again pleased with a role he did a nicely casted movie not the best but pretty decent everyone did their jobs very well with having to no longer listen to the monologues in all the characters heads throughout the movie like the one in the 80s was a huge improvement this is part one so establishes better the back story and the factions better than the original ever did well worth the watch i know denis villeneuve changed some of it from the book which i really wish directors would stop doing it wasnt enough to distract from the movie itself
Nov 9 2021,positive,triumph of film making perhaps the most book accurate movie ive ever seen of course some scenes were left out as in any booktomovie adaptation but every scene they showed was spot on having just read the book as well i could easily identify lines straight from the book and was even able to anticipate them with excitement the lines which werent from the book were still very good and the minor changes to book scenes were all handled in the way they should be a simple change to make something more natural in a movie but with a book based twist that makes it clear they did it for the sake of storytelling not just to rewrite dune  especially for dune fans i highly recommend the movie
Nov 9 2021,positive,the scope of this universe is well conveyed
Nov 9 2021,neutral,the movie looks amazing but its very very very slow
Nov 9 2021,positive,i felt like it stayed true to the book with only subtle differences that didnt take away from the historyessence of the story cant wait for the next one
Nov 9 2021,positive,dune is not a perfect film im only giving it 5 stars because of the lunkheads who give it 1 star or think its boring  this film has something to absorb in every frame  the performances are terrific across the board especially chalamet and ferguson  i thought mamoa was a touch overpraised but still very charming  cant wait for the sequel  like many i wished there had been more political intrigue leading up to the betrayal of duke leto but i get why some stuff had to be trimmed  congrats to all were lucky to get something this ambitious and wellexecuted
Nov 9 2021,positive,great film it feels imcomplete though but not to the movies fault its part one of the adpatation of the book so hopefully part 2 ends of being as good as part 1 if part 2 is anywhere as good as this film i would easily give this a 5 star rating since the film would now have a conclusion
Nov 9 2021,positive,best epic scifi ive watched in years constantly on edge of my seat and left begging for more
Nov 9 2021,positive,great start to the franchise denis does it again with another excellent entry into the scifi genre the visual design and cinematography are fantastic as is the score by hans zimmer follows the important beats from the book pretty closely and the performances from the main cast chalamet isaac and ferguson are stellar
Nov 9 2021,positive,amazing film that surpassed my expectations  im usually disappointed by remakes but this one blew me away
Nov 9 2021,positive,as someone who did not read the book very little is actually explained and so its very hard to follow along it felt more like watching a national geographic documentary about an alien planet than a narrative gorgeous visuals but very little happenedand what did happen happened verrryyy slowly legit most of the movie was in slow motion little to no character development or depth was clear at all although this is the first movie of a trilogy it should have been a 13 the length they would have accomplished just as much
Nov 9 2021,negative,this is really a rotten version my spouse and i do agree it is worse than the previous versions
Nov 9 2021,positive,does a great job at world building looks amazing a little slow but well done flick
Nov 9 2021,positive,man was this movie great i mean the action everything this film is beautiful also do yourself a favor see it in imax 3d
Nov 9 2021,positive,my favorite film of 2021 absolutely loved it amazing visuals sound music and performances as well as a digestible story cant wait to watch again
Nov 9 2021,negative,this was so boring  both dune miniseries were so much better to watch  i cant imagine someone without any previous knowledge of dune having a clue what was going on but hey they had a lot of cgi    go watch the 2000s miniseries its so much better
Nov 9 2021,positive,incredible visuals and cinematography the dynamic of the whole thing is very refreshing and the slower pace and focus on story was a nice change of pace from other modern movies the action sequences are absolutely incredible very visceral and emotional timothee chalamet and jason mamoa are a bit overrated in my opinion but oscar isaac is enormous a mustsee
Nov 9 2021,positive,as someone who had zero knowledge about the dune books and the lore this movie was excellent into getting me to know that world and how everything works without being over the nose exposition masterful delivery from denis villeneuve
Nov 9 2021,positive,well conceived  executed adaptation of herberts novel offers a unique vision of the dune universe yet is easier to identify with  become enthralled by than it is w other films in the science fiction genre  the solid cast does include several hansel hes so hot right now names in the biz definitely the case for most of the leads clalament ferguson zendaya isaac momoa  not to say they were poorly cast or their acting was substandard because truth be told there is no weak link in the chain personally not a fan of isaac  he would not have been my choice to portray leto but in the grand scheme he was fine  noteworthy casting includes bardem rampling duncanbrewster  skarsgard  beautifully shot lavish set pieces  striking imagery all incite a sense of wonderment  but to hear  see words like masterpiece  5 star rating so quickly attributed to dune which would by all accounts constitute a flawless film is a tad folly  and while the flaws are few  far between script mostly i dont see this film as 5 star worthy 4 star i can
Nov 9 2021,negative,well made but extremely boring and overrated 
Nov 9 2021,positive,i wont be surprised if dune is going to be the best scifi of the year i got satisfying experience by the cinematography immersive soundtracks and a lot of stunning visuals i bet some may not enjoy this because the whole movie focus on building up the story and characters background  which may confuse and make some audiences feel bored but if you are a geek of this franchise i guarantee you this worth your long waits
Nov 9 2021,negative,wow     they took every character every scene and even the sets and made them all 1000 times less than the original real dune with most characters mumbling unintelligibly the movie industry has died    i give it one star for the cgi like watching dune the video game
Nov 9 2021,positive,excellent first chapter  the special effects are much improved as can be expected  the plot is faithful to the series without being too rigid but the star of the show is the amazing use of imagery  the shots are thoughtfully orchestrated and give you time to digest the complexity of the plot characterization and acting  rarely do movies take advantage of the fact that they are a visual medium and the new dune is quite savvy in that regard  you will not be disappointed in the remake and i hope they manage to keep the quality to the same standard in future installments bravo to all this is an exceptional film
Nov 9 2021,positive,i watched this at home via hbomax and thought it was visually stunning i think it was a bit too long they could have ended it before a lot of the stuff after the battle scenes
Nov 9 2021,positive,its very well acted and the action scenes are incredible however even the scenes with no action or drama are covered with very loud impassioned music which becomes a bit exhausting by the end
Nov 9 2021,positive,a lot to like about dune but very frustrating that the did not advertise this a 12 a movie part 1  it is like the lied to us to make more   at least the 80s dune movie was the entire movie    that all being said i am looking forward to dune part 2 the 2nd half of the bookmovie is way better than the first half  the first 12 of the book is just setting everything up and explaining the universepeople
Nov 9 2021,positive,i was so thankful to see that they did not rush through the story like the last dune movie this is wonderfully paced i would say it is perfect the pacing i mean everyone does a great job duncan idaho is my favorite character from the book jason momoa does a decent job of playing that role not perfect but decent     ive seen the movie twice and loved it both times
Nov 9 2021,positive,an astonishing rendition of an incredible story dune 2021 leans into the strengths of cinema instead of trying to adapt the novel wordforword while its predecessors saw fit to keep huge swathes of the novels dialogue denis villeneuves adaptation opts not to speak down to the viewer by instead creating visual spectacle and character interactions that require the viewers full attention     a thrilling adventure start to finish filled with stunning shots and incredible acting particularly from rebecca ferguson but the whole cast does an impeccable job dune 2021 doesnt disappoint
Nov 9 2021,positive,the next star wars and lord of the rings it has an amazing story characters score and visuals def a must see for any scifi epic fan keep in mind this is part one of a two part film so if you havent read the book dont feel like the movie ended and isnt getting a sequel     a  9510  96
Nov 9 2021,negative,it was an  okay average  book but that doesnt excuse it as another best movie ever it was a terrible movie then its a terrible movie now
Nov 9 2021,negative,it was a mom and son talking about space politics for 25 hours and then zendaya perfume commercial would randomley apper
Nov 9 2021,negative,all setup and no payoff it was not advertised as only half of a movie but even then it can have a beginning middle and an end did not connect with the main character either he doesnt take much action himself throughout the movie until a scene at the end something that was a completely unmotivated conflict but at least it showed him being capable it will be interesting to see if you can watch the next movie without watching this one im going to bet you can
Nov 9 2021,positive,i love the 84 version and this just blows that away in visuals scope depth the characters were fully realized and the score was amazing my only issue is because i loved the 84 and i wish there was some voiceover in parts but thats just me 
Nov 9 2021,positive,the sound was excellent the picture quality was impressive but i was expecting the size of the screen to be larger maybe if i get seats closer to the screen that may solve that issue
Nov 9 2021,positive,wonderful movie   each frame is a work of art
Nov 9 2021,positive,breathtaking scenery and action
Nov 9 2021,positive,best blockbuster in recent years  impressive visuals immersive sound great acting  cool worldbuilding
Nov 9 2021,negative,changing the sex of a major character from the greatest scifi novel of all time is an automatic 1 star review casting kynes as a silly girl with dreadlocks is an insult to the source material the shame of it is that that one choice was like taking a dump on the mona lisa almost every thing else in the movie was pure genius
Nov 9 2021,positive,have you ever heard the expression its like x and y had a baby well this adaptation is like alien interstellar and star wars had a threesome i read the book once 20 years ago but this film brought it all back the actors hit their characters to a tee the visuals and acton sequences were original and out of this world and the music was like a bellicose interstellar cant wait to watch it again
Nov 9 2021,positive,movie was absolutely beautiful and a must see in imax cast was incredible and i cant wait to see the sequel
Nov 9 2021,positive,the film i was waiting for it is the perfect adaptation of the book ive read the first chapter of the saga few years ago and i loved it absolutelt loved it so when i learned about the making of the movie my exepctations were very high i was both scared and hopeful at the same time then i watched the film and walked out of the cinema so happy to have seen such a high quality film    someone said they get bored i didnt realize the time that passed so quickly indeed i confused the ending with the interval beleaving it was going to continue but im glad denis villeneuve took all the time necessary to make a great movie out of a great novel    it was spectacular in every sense from the sounding to the photography every frame and the way they are shown is stunning
Nov 9 2021,negative,wtf this shit is boring asf the trailer is very misleading this movie is basically a trailer for the second one
Nov 9 2021,positive,great pictures but come on this cold have been told in one hour i would have loved to see it develop further in this movie
Nov 9 2021,positive,i loved it as fan of the previous ones i loved it can hardly wait for the sequel
Nov 9 2021,positive,dune delivers what is promised  not only is it well laid out story for the new fans it is also a love letter to the long time fans of the original film and the book source materialthe acting was genuinely delivered  the visuals we mesmerizing  and han zimmer never fails to deliver  i cant wait for future installments
Nov 9 2021,positive,i actually enjoyed this effort why arent more people talking about it
Nov 9 2021,positive,fantastic epic scenes worthy of the dune franchise great acting cant wait for the next one
Nov 9 2021,positive,amazing story amazing cast amazing cinematography 
Nov 9 2021,positive,kind of boring but incredible graphics and amazing actors who are also pleasing to look at there was intrigue which makes me want to watch the next movie
Nov 9 2021,positive,outstanding acting special affects intriguing story line  loved it
Nov 9 2021,positive,the background music is a kind of too loud except for the bgm the rest of the movie is awesome amazing and classic so worth it cant wait for the next dune part 2
Nov 9 2021,positive,much better than the 1984 version but not awesome i am looking forward to its sequels though also i feel like playing dune rts games again
Nov 9 2021,positive,i have a hard time being able to focus on a movie all the way through in one sitting but this one henerally got me intrested and keep me focused 1010 must watch
Nov 9 2021,positive,i really appreciate this movie along with other films from the director dune has very impressive elements that really make it great first i would point out how well executed the pacing is it doesnt drag or go on for too long there is always something interesting going on secondly the amount of details this movie contains is special all the scenes have meaning to me and one thing always leads to another without leaving empty space special effects are also very intriguing they feel smooth and satisfying visuals in general in this movie are intriguing im surprised a blockbuster movie was even able to do this soundtrack was honestly the best part of this movie the scores accompanied by the voices is just beautiful the few monologues are just as beautiful and thought provoking finally the cinematography in this movie is just great especially in the action scenes like the thopter scene or the first encounter with the worm overall this movie flows very well together and never misses a beat my rating would be a 910
Nov 9 2021,negative,this movie is dated had world building issues and timmy as the lead was not a good choice
Nov 9 2021,positive,it took a minute or 2 to catch up with what was going on
Nov 9 2021,positive,really good movie i love scifi movies and this one does not disappoint for some reason it gave me a riddick vibe at times excited to see the next one 
Nov 9 2021,positive,dune is definitely not a movie without its flaws but it is another impressive showing from dennis villeneuve i highly doubt any other person could handle a decades later sequel to a highly regarded classic such as blade runner but dennis managed to make a movie that i like even more than the original with dune he somehow has done it again dune is a highly complicated thing to make at this point with the numerous previous versions and having to work with the book on top of it all and yet he somehow created another gorgeous epic that stands on its own in spite of all the other iterations it is a fantastic vision and feels like a fully realized world with cultures and mannerisms that arent explicitly explained or pointed out it respects your intelligence and allows you to figure out things for yourself without ever being too much i was surprised to find out that it was a part 1 and couldnt believe the movie was over when it ended the 2 and a half hours flew by but when i recount the film not too much actually happened ill attribute that more to the world building and the need to establish the universe and hope that the next is even more eventful to pay off on the investment i cant wait for the next
Nov 9 2021,negative,this movie was just a set up for a sequel they spent way too long on character development on characters that are barley in this movie the story line in general was very flat the climax if u can call it that was very predictable and the ending leaves you wondering why you even wasted your time i would not recommend for anyone to watch this movie i wish i could give this movie 05 stars but this website wont let me
Nov 9 2021,positive,i loved this movie i didnt know much about this movie going in other than it inspired many other movies including star wars which i love
Nov 9 2021,positive,this movie was honestly amazing i literally felt like i was on a different planet for 2 hours it was so different and everything in the movie that happened was very purposeful the score is also incredible and the cinematography and effects were so seamless i forgot it wasnt real  it was also a very intellectual film 1010 recommend
Nov 9 2021,positive,a narratively rich and complex epic supported by an impeccable cast and grandiose monumental and sublime cinematography and audio an amazing cinematic experience that demands to be seen on the biggest screen and speakers possible
Nov 9 2021,positive,loved that movie so beautiful and very well done  read the book and this movie is as good as the book
Nov 9 2021,positive,its great to look at and the actors are really good but it was so packed with information and only makes sense knowing its not a stand alone movie it would have been nice to have a neater ending
Nov 9 2021,positive,loved everything about it
Nov 9 2021,positive,this movie is really different than what is being putting out there nowadays even as a science fiction movie i feel like it did a great job at not falling into stereotypical tropes it still has some but it did it in a way that it made its own overall recommend if you are into scifi movies with more in depth plots soundtrack is great cgi is beautiful colors do justice at setting the tone and actors did well
Nov 9 2021,positive,everything was good  fantastic all categories were delivered actors acting setcostumes action suspense cinematography fx nothn to dislike lookn forward to seeing the next chapter thnx
Nov 9 2021,positive,the overall story could be a little overwhelming and bit hard to follow sometimes the world building visuals and size of the movie completely makes up for it   the movie definitely need a part 2 tho because the movie as a stand alone leaves a lot to be desired i wanna see more
Nov 9 2021,positive,while it doesnt feel like theres a whole lot of heart placed on the films characters or personalities at the very least you understand them and their pieces in this meticulously awestriking grand spectacle ofhalf a movie banking on part ii making good on the promises and foundations laid in this film i found this movie to be extremely well crafted it is exactly what weve come to expect from denis villeneuve after films like arrival and blade runner 2049 this is one of those movies that demands to be seen on the largest screen possible for visuals alone coupled with a unique narrative format still of course it feels like half a movie and that may bother some viewers there was a whole lot to like a whole lot to take in and yes a whole lot of sand
Nov 9 2021,positive,if you love star wars i would consider seeing dune
Nov 9 2021,positive,the sound design and score almost surpasses the visuals and magnificent acting this is part one but still has a satisfying conclusion must see in theater even if you have hbomax
Nov 8 2021,positive,i went into watching dune as a blank slate i didnt know anything about the story beyond the trailer and i was super excited to see it it absolutely lived up to the hype stellar acting immersive sound stunning visuals and a story i cant wait to see continue i am so impressed i know dune is a really dense book and i later learned they left out some things that seem like they wouldve been poignant to include but overall they did a great job of introducing and plunging us into this world i had to really pay attention and i followed it pretty well the film is especially well cast and i invested in the characters very quickly it has an excellent portrayal of emotionally mature men who love and respect each other  a welcome change from the usual hardened military men with family at the core of the story and with a smart team of creators dune is on the path to becoming one of the best scifi series ever made
Nov 8 2021,positive,overall the movie is very good the soundtrack  battle scenes were a bit too loud in fact the volume during the previews was also much louder than necessary my hearing is excellent and i dont want it damaged from watching movies in a theater
Nov 8 2021,positive,this cements denis villeneuve as one of the most challenging and brilliant directors in the world right now with blade runner 2049 bringing up the rear beautifully and compellingly sets us up for a second epic dune film
Nov 8 2021,positive,simply amazing  a true cinematic experience 
Nov 8 2021,positive,what i love about science fiction when its done well serious lived in world building denis is one of my favorite filmmakers working together the way he does big budget scale in a grounded way in a world where most directors lose vision once they jump into a big budget cgi machine
Nov 8 2021,positive,great adaptation of a wonderful novel  star wars for adults  real science fiction
Nov 8 2021,positive,loved the movie great storytelling with great visuals and soundtrack was epic all actorsactresses gave an awesome performance oscar isaac was my favorite character ive seen it 3 times and i might see it again later
Nov 8 2021,positive,stunning i love it never heard of dune before but this was my favorite movie all time and now im into dune
Nov 8 2021,positive,this movie was so good
Nov 8 2021,positive,a great first part to an epic adaptation dune is a difficult book to adapt to film given the hidden powers of the bene gesserit and the assumed history of the universe villaneuve had an excellent vision and executed excited for part ii
Nov 8 2021,positive,its ok not great mostly portentous long shots and heavy music some dialog is obscured its more about implied meaning than actual storytelling the most important reveals are stuffed quickly into loud action scenes rather than drawn out intriguingly to build a substantive narrative more about its own greatness than anything
Nov 8 2021,negative,we are a joke to them warner bros gave it the best marketing campaign ever to only give us what should be an incredibly expensive really good produced and extremely long pilot of what seems to be a long tv show
Nov 8 2021,negative,i didnt like it  the director clearly had an agenda to distort elevate things that were not in the book  it wasnt extremely overt but it was there  some scenes were well done some scenes were very well done but much of it felt rushed and even disconnected the cuts between scenes were often disorienting  the dialogue was dumbed down in several places  they spent far too much time dwelling on pauls dreams and visions of chani  also the acting was largely poor  a few actors  tried to elevate things oscar issac but most engaged in overacting more emotion than called for  ive often wondered if dune is just too rich and deep a story especially the first half of the book to be transferred to any other medium  if we can just get a team that aims to be faithful to the source material maybe well find out  since this team isnt even aiming for that this one is a big fail to me
Nov 8 2021,positive,such a master display of directing style some of the best cinematography in any scifi ever characters are well developed as well as the world only negatives would be the slow burn and overpowering score at times overall great experience into a beautifully crafted world that brings the deeper more heady scifi back to the forefront of movie conversations looking forward to part ii and the many great conversations this movie will create
Nov 8 2021,positive,it was okay definitely felt the run time 
Nov 8 2021,positive,its like star wars but at the same time it aint the movie kept me intrested the whole time and it was shot so beautifully must see
Nov 8 2021,positive,loved it a truly beautiful movie with fantastic performances throughout cant wait for part 2
Nov 8 2021,positive,an excellent make of a very difficult story while they chose to split the book into 2 movies realistically it could have easily been 3  while this movie captures the feel of the book and tells a compelling story there are plenty of nuances that are left on the cutting room floor to make it to 25 hours  im hoping for a directors cut or extended edition because there is so much more world building and exposition needed
Nov 8 2021,positive,does a great job of condensing the essentials of the plot into a story line that can be followed movies are never as good as the book so the measure of greatness is not how close the movie is to the book but how well the movie conveys the story in an entertaining way  this movie accomplishes that very well
Nov 8 2021,positive,i buyed the novel 2 years before the first delusional movie  tried to like the tv series but special effects were anything then special   this one is finally the dune i expected for 40 years  the spice must flow
Nov 8 2021,neutral,not as bad as original
Nov 8 2021,positive,director denis villeneuve did it again amazing visuals from start to finish cant wait to see the sequel
Nov 8 2021,positive,anyone who is a fan of the book series will not be disappointed with the film from the story to the action to the amazing ensemble cast performances dune is a scifi film that will have audiences exploring worlds and wonder whats going to happen next
Nov 8 2021,positive,one of the best movies that i have ever watched in my life i cried hard at the end of the movie just because i had too many emotions hans zimmer created a masterpiece score for the movie
Nov 8 2021,positive,i wouldnt have minded if was a little longer and less scenes were edited out  i would expect there to be an extended version released on blue ray at some point  i think most will agree the movie would have been better if included once they see those scenes  i knew the story well but i would expect the newbies to be a bit lost at times and i worry that some wont enjoy as much and be less inclined to come back for more
Nov 8 2021,positive,everything good  but is zendaya the only actress in hollywood
Nov 8 2021,positive,superb film got me wanting more dune
Nov 8 2021,positive,good movie  it moved kinda slow at first  but i know its a origin story  and the universe they built is great  so i can see if they end up making sequels that they will probably be better 
Nov 8 2021,positive,great start to a new universe must see
Nov 8 2021,positive,the only thing wrong w it is that part two isnt even made yet itll be two or three years until we can see the conclusion by then people will have lost interest but this movie was amazing 
Nov 8 2021,positive,thoughtful slow but never boring methodical really long extremely gorgeous
Nov 8 2021,positive,i enjoy the movie alot but the ending was a little disappointing it leaves the audience hanging now i feel i should read the book
Nov 8 2021,neutral,almost slept though first 45 minutes too much time on home planet not enough on dune character development weak for main characters non existent for others duncan and gurney are prime examples cinematography is awesome visually pleasing and big but too much time spent on minutia  entire attack on the planet lasts just minutes by contrast overall worth seeing in theater hopefully sequels are more efficient and tell the story better
Nov 8 2021,negative,i didnt understand this movie i guess if you havent read the books or watched the original you wont understand this i tried to watch this movie 3 times i couldnt get into to it
Nov 8 2021,positive,one of the best scifi movies to have been released in the past couple of years highly recommend the books if you have not read them and having recently rewatched the david lynch version this one does not dump everything on you at once and move at a faster than needed pace fantastic set pieces and cinematography i can only hope part two is just as good
Nov 8 2021,neutral,dull and boring  fell asleep halfway thru  no way it measures up to the original imo 
Nov 8 2021,negative,confusing even though ive read the book and knew what to expect slowpaced great fight scenes left you hanging and killed off jason momoa too quickly overall i was disappointed
Nov 8 2021,negative,literall so boring lmao the only good thing about this movie was the way it looked the plot was boring and had me itching to play on my phone the whole time
Nov 8 2021,positive,superb im just looking forward to watch 2nd part
Nov 8 2021,positive,one of the best cinematic experiences of all time sound image and story wise
Nov 8 2021,positive,feast to the eyes  excellent direction and cinematography every element of the movie was captured so well and clean it was visually marvelous the background score was fabulous we cannot remove fault in music when the composer is a legend himself the well casted characters did justice to their respective roles
Nov 8 2021,positive,awesome movie obviously they have now more time to develop the plot  show more character developments as well since its planned to be 2 movies at least or perhaps a trilogy
Nov 8 2021,positive,great scenery and visuals but i got tired of the swelling or pounding music the dialogue felt so predictable and the harkonnens came off almost comic at moments oh well epics are hard to get on screen
Nov 8 2021,negative,not for me  boring
Nov 8 2021,positive,i wasnt sure if i would like this film as i am a huge fan of the books and even lynchs film while not perfect was still a good watch imo but denis really hit this one out of the park theres definitely some missed opportunities with certain characters like piter and not seeing gurney with his baliset hopefully in deleted scenes on dvd but no feyd was so disappointing hopefully in part 2 those would probably be my only issues with the film i was afraid from the trailers and how dark everything was would be bad but seeing it 3x now it was perfect i thought oscar issacs performance of leto was brilliant but lady jessica was meh the gom jabar scene with rev mother was definitely the highlight for me i do wish denis would have done more to follow the other of events in the book especially with the spy i liked skargards portrayal of baron however i felt the look didnt capture how its described in the book and in the book he was more sadistic than portrayed in the film the only performance i thought was lacking was bautistas he seemed just going thru the motions for a paycheck not like hes a good actor anyhow drax is meh already its like hes still acting how he did when wrestling well i imagine its the same i never watched wrestling when he was there i stopped in 1991
Nov 8 2021,positive,only a dragging start to the third act holds this scifi fantasy epic back from being perfect the mythology set up is so vast but well displayed for the audience villeneuve has a great vision for this property and i for one cant wait for part 2
Nov 8 2021,positive,an amazing take on the classic scifi book with incredible visuals and sound effects would definitely recommend
Nov 8 2021,positive,really liked the storyline and plot overall think there couldve been more action scenes and it was a bit dragging to get to certain points    i personally liked it but can see why it has mixed reviews from peers
Nov 8 2021,positive,awesome movie  i cant wait for the next part  unfortunately it wont be out until october 2023
Nov 8 2021,positive,the movie keeps the pace of the novel and stays true it however was able to cover only the first half of it with no plans to release second chapter it is half story movie
Nov 8 2021,positive,amazing visuals and sublime sound track the movie does a good job of explaining the intricacies of the plot without getting too condescending superb acting and great direction definitely makes this movie one of the best of the year
Nov 8 2021,positive,absolutely loved this movie what an amazing cast music visuals and the perfect handling of the story itself
Nov 8 2021,positive,dune  1010 denis villeneuves long awaited long in production magnum opus has finally released and though it feels like it leaves you desiring more to see by the end of the film the execution and motivation towards the film creates for one of the best cinematic experiences this year dune offers up the age old tale of a young person who ends up realizing what their life destiny is meant to be as he gains this knowledge and follows his somewhat predetermined destiny the kingdom that his family rules over is burned to the ground how he rises from the ashes and tries to fulfill his reoccurring dreams forms the rest of the story this is a film that really emphasizes the whole imax filming decision its literally captivating and throws you into the world effortlessly you can tell why warner bros wanted him to direct as his influences from arrival and blade runner 2049 are all over this film its easy to write off dune as predictable or somewhat ive seen this story before category many epic stories and films have used the source novel as inspiration so when you watch the movie you have this sense of familiarity it doesnt hinder the experience though as you feel the power dynamics and expansive alien landscape through the lens of greig fraser timothee chalamet does a fantastic job of shouldering such a big project his first blockbuster leading role shows hes got the qualities to be a big time star rebecca ferguson is also fantastic as the warrior mother to his character along with him she helps catapult the story forward the film is up to the brim with great performances and huge stars and this is why the film feels like its interesting even during the long drawn sequences at certain moments this is just the beginning as they say at the beginning and end of the film so we shall wait and see what the next parts will hold one things for sure this could end up being the next franchise hollywood needs
Nov 8 2021,positive,very true to the book  cast was perfect
Nov 8 2021,positive,the only problem is the placement of the end as it feels both too early and both too late
Nov 8 2021,positive,had to take away a star for plot holes but first the pros beautiful images truly transports you to another world the ship designs are amazing and the acting solid the movie gave more depth to the relationship between paul and his father however if you dont know the books or havent seen the 1984 version you miss a lot the purpose of spice the whole reason for the war what it really does not only for the universe but also to the person mentally physically is implied or just a side comment maybe theyll fix that in the second part next where is feydrautha harkonnen pronounced harkonen right again maybe in part 2 finally little details like the doctors conditioning and changing linesno biggie but for newcomers they may miss the complex world herbert created
Nov 8 2021,positive,this was an amazing movie dune fulfilled all of my expectations i strongly recommend it if you havent seen yet
Nov 8 2021,positive,great movie well done and followed the story line quite well  cant wait till part 2
Nov 8 2021,positive,it loses many of the books smaller moments and greatly simplifies the plot but what it retains is presented in brilliant form if fans of frank herbert go into this with an open mind they should enjoy the core of the story that remains
Nov 8 2021,positive,this movie was really good the cinematography was incredible however i wouldve enjoyed this movie more if i knew what was happening
Nov 8 2021,positive,dune is an overwhelming visual experience lovingly adapted and crafted by one of scifis best recent directors it is a masterclass in filmmaking and is sure to have scifi lovers chomping at the bit for more
Nov 8 2021,positive,just recently read the book a few months ago and the adaptation was incredible im a huge villeneuve fan and this movie had his classic huge camera shots and beautiful landscapes additionally hanz zimmer wrote an amazing score and it was incredible to listen to highly recommend
Nov 8 2021,positive,i read the book when i was 17 saw the first dune movie and although dessapointed came to give a try to villeneuves bottomline i have seen it twice already its an immediate classic in the sifi sphere
Nov 8 2021,positive,the cinematography was award winning  it was filmed so beautifully  i could watch this movie a thousand times excellent casting art direction special effects costumes etc i was a little disappointed that it only covered half the book  setting it up for a sequel i hope part 2 is in production
Nov 8 2021,negative,dont like itthey could do better
Nov 8 2021,positive,we absolutely loved the movie the reason i cant give it 5 stars though is that sound effects and soundtrack were way too loud often drowning out the dialog i dont understand why the movie producers think louder is better it certainly gives me something to consider when thinking of seeing a movie in the theater
Nov 8 2021,positive,most fun ive had at the movies in a long time
Nov 8 2021,positive,slow pace needed some explanation which was not given properly
Nov 8 2021,positive,i like that they took their time on this one and really tried to tell the story instead of just throwing together what they could in 2 hours and making you read the book to figure out what happened
Nov 8 2021,positive,denis villeneueve has put out one of the most gorgeous visually made films ever made on the big screen denis villenueve found a nice way to make the viewer engaged in the story and understand the universe and characters this could also be one of  hans zimmers best score it is truly stunning
Nov 8 2021,positive,its great love it so much
Nov 8 2021,positive,fast moving  clear storyline   fun to watch  star wars for adults
Nov 8 2021,positive,i feel bad giving it a very lukewarm review because the production values were high the cgi was great and the actors were credible and well cast  but unless youve read the book and understand it its hard to enjoy this film  it simply wasnt entertaining  i gave it two hours and the film still didnt have its hooks in me so i walked out  its possible that the source material simply doesnt lend itself to film as the directorproducer certainly gave it a heroic try  but it fell flat  it could have used a lot of editing as it is 25 hours which is at least 30 minutes too long
Nov 8 2021,positive,true to the book and respectful portrayal of herberts vision and  ideals  great cast  this showing was loud and i found myself covering my ears and movie was a little dark  but that could have been planned  i did feel like i was in a dust storm much of the time
Nov 8 2021,negative,dunes mom is this sad angry woman who has picked up the title of witch from tiktok paul no longer has the ability to think or reason but i never really liked paul anyway he was kindof a loser in the books duncan the absolute stallion was cast by momoa who could have played a more based chad character but his performance was still pretty cool short but exciting fight scenes lots of movie time spent shallowly glancing over themes of dune asif it was written for big dummys that want to claim to be fans of the series still a better movie than that other one with sting or the lame mini series but if you enjoy plugging into a tv show and stroking your ego the movie is more of a 45 stars
Nov 8 2021,negative,a total bore i walked out after an hour of noise and torture
Nov 8 2021,positive,this is it people dune has finally broken the curse and it has managed to get the adaptation that the source material deserves frank herberts 1965 magnum opus series has notoriously struggled to properly be translated to film as it was once believed to be a series that can never be adapted the right way not anymore denis villeneuve showed us once again that he is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to scifi movies starting to rival even the master of scifi himself ridley scott from the amazing arrival 2016 to the underperforming but critically acclaimed blade runner 2049 2017 villeneuve has managed to do the impossible with dune and it seems that the secret behind it was that the movie actually covers only half of the first book compared to the 1984 and 2000 adaptations which covered the whole first novel the actors have managed to step into the characters shoes beautifully a heavy hitting alist cast including timothée chalamet prince paul atreides rebecca ferguson lady jessica oscar isaac king leto atreides i jason momoa duncan idaho zendaya chani you get the idea star studded cast bring to life this visually mesmerizing film while the politics behind the story can be a bit confusing for those who havent read the books myself included the film has chosen a smart way of drip feeding us world building elements instead of bombarding us with exposition which made the whole plot easier to consume even if we dont have all the anwers yet which will most likely be answered in future movies ive made the mistake of watching the movie at home via streaming and while it was certainly an enjoyable time this needs to be experienced in imax or dolby atmos as the sound design is something to behold you need to hear it for yourself i am now confident that this series is in good hands as demonstrated by the fact that dune 2 has already been confirmed for fans of dune this is it guys and for any people who have even the slightest inclinations towards scifi or visual marvels this is an easy recommendation grab some snacks and let yourself be transported to arrakis for what has to be one of if not the best movies of 2021
Nov 8 2021,positive,to be totally honest with you i just watched this for  timothée chalamet but getting in to the movie i actually really liked it it was a really cool and complexes movie witch was good the only problem i had with this was the amount of dialog zendaya had but i have a feeling she will have more in part 2 which i cant wait for in 2023 over all loved this film please go watch i have seen it about 3 times and i think i might go watch it again now bye guys
Nov 8 2021,negative,too boring and slow 
Nov 8 2021,positive,the first 30 minutes were a bit confusing because so much information was being thrown at the audience once you remember the characters and their stories then its where the film starts to get real good the production quality is top tier if you like complex storylines you will be into this film
Nov 8 2021,positive,spectacularloved it alot 
Nov 8 2021,positive,9710    may thy knife chip and shatter          holy crap that movie was honestly mind blowing visually the story does move pretty fast but i loved it i have never said oh my god so many times in one film the cinematography and score are top tier and the visual aspects of the movie blew me away the wait for the sequel is going to be even worse then the wait for this movie
Nov 8 2021,positive,best movie in years
Nov 8 2021,positive,i never read the books but it is clear that the movie captures the complexity of the history really immersive and interesting it is like star wars meets game of thrones
Nov 8 2021,positive,maybe its because i havent read any of the novels or maybe its because the filmmakers always planned on this being the first film of two three but i had trouble following the story from a newcomers point of view the cinematography and score were excellent and the acting was great dune definitely needs a sequel to answer some of the questions it raised an enjoyable film which will hopefully become more enjoyable with a followup to finish this incomplete story
Nov 8 2021,positive,it was incredible another epic movie series   a great group of actors and all the right elements of good and evil
Nov 8 2021,negative,not for those looking for a deeper interpretation of the source material nor fans of the shakespearean storytelling methods of the original book the only redeeming quality is the illusion of substance when viewed on an impressive screen honestly an embarrassment considering the resources available to those responsible
Nov 8 2021,positive,loved it  the sound was amazing as was the sets and cinematography
Nov 8 2021,positive,it was dope it can drag just a wee bit but for the most part it will keep you on the edge of your seat i havent seen something this intense in a good way in a while
Nov 8 2021,negative,if you dont know the book movie is worthless not a moviea visualization
Nov 8 2021,positive,my favorite movie and book series
Nov 8 2021,positive,minor spoilers my wife and i loved it overall but by no means was it mind blowing 90 of the film took place over about 2 days it barely scratched the surface of what this franchise could become how is paul just gonna ditch his people on his home planet they have no leader now why did the emperor want their people dead looking forward to the next one but were going to have to wait years which makes me which they took the story a little further than they did at the pace they moved in this one they could have 10 films this film just told a backstory to setup a sequel they shouldve just cut an hour out and added an hour of the sequel 
Nov 8 2021,positive,best sci fi movie that ive seen in a minute best reboot to ever come out of hollywood
Nov 8 2021,negative,i wish i could give this movie a zero hands down one of the worst movies i have ever seen i dont know why it got high ratings
Nov 8 2021,positive,slow pacing but gorgeous as a piece of art in both art and sound direction
Nov 8 2021,positive,this started slow but the imagery and visuals kept me going after the first act i was then captivated and the movie only gets better ive seen some people that didnt liked the ending but i didnt mind it lady jessica and paul are such great characters cant wait for a sequel
Nov 8 2021,neutral,meh it was fine but lynchs version is still a better watch thus far
Nov 8 2021,positive,awesome cinematography story flow cast music fx and sound effects
Nov 8 2021,positive,for those who say the movie is too longi didnt feel that at all i left the theater wishing there was more of it
Nov 8 2021,positive,absolutely gorgeous cinematography and soundscape refreshingly original storytelling  a mustsee in the theater
Nov 8 2021,neutral,underwhelming especially when compared to the reviews cool visuals yeah kinda the actors do what they can with the script theyve been given the direction is just not good long scenes where nothing happens just people loading  unloading ships etc but theyre big ships whatever weve seen great visuals before they mean nothing without a good story  the backstory was not explained well where they did talk about it the dialogue was hard to hear over the sound effects the dark scenes were way too dark think game of thrones s8e3 dark i watched a few scenes from the 1984 version and found the direction and content more appealing and easier to follow
Nov 8 2021,positive,this is the best scifi movie ive ever seen  the visuals and special effects are phenomenal  im glad they put effort into making sure the cgi didnt look cartoonish  ive read the books so i was able to follow the story  if you dont know the story you will get confused in some areas  my guess is they had more exposition but had to cut some of it out to shorten the movie which is very long  the acting was excellent as well as the soundtrack  the actor playing paul was better than i thought he would be after seeing the trailers  at that time he looked like an emo teenager  that wasnt the case however after seeing the whole movie          the criticism i have is the need to edit some of the long scenes  if you arent familiar with the story those might be a little painful for you to watch  it reminded me of the enormity of the lord of the rings production  its not an easy story to tell so im glad they are having a sequel  someone finally got the production of dune right
Nov 8 2021,positive,the movie was very long and doesnt resolve it seemingly leads into a sequel
Nov 8 2021,positive,its really good but sets up a lot and has tons of exposition
Nov 8 2021,positive,dont know anything about dune but it kept me interested almost the entire way
Nov 8 2021,positive,dune is a sfiencefiction masterpiece with breathtaking visuals charismatic performances and an epic score if you are a fan of scifi or the director denis villeneuve this is a mustsee
Nov 8 2021,positive,too slow and not enough action
Nov 8 2021,positive,the effects were very good the story had faint resemblance to star wars they both have the force they both have hugely obese characters  jaba and the emperor  and the empire the main character is very much like luke skywalker  this still was entertaining and makes you wanting part 2 of the saga
Nov 8 2021,positive,great acting the plot seemed like a set up to something bigger
Nov 8 2021,positive,the movie is slow it doesnt explain the story behind the characters the action scenes are not exciting im not going to the movies to check out the sequel
Nov 8 2021,positive,beautiful graphics but very slow moving went into it not knowing anything about the story seems like the sequels will be better
Nov 8 2021,positive,an incredible adaptation of the novel once again villenueve delivers a beautiful science fiction film the story is a slow build but the performances are fantastic i cant wait to see the second movie
Nov 8 2021,negative,i dont believe i have ever been more disappointed in a movie after the trailer looked so damn good all the action sequences were cut short right before reaching the climax which was very frustrating
Nov 8 2021,positive,it was very good but i think they should have gender swapped the baron harkonnen with melissa mccathy or rosie o donald
Nov 8 2021,positive,this is part one and at over 2  hours long it goes fairly quickly much better than the previous attempt but a lot more tech to work with now im looking forward to the next one
Nov 8 2021,positive,excellent job on putting the first half of the book into a serious film format many of us have been waiting for this for years
Nov 8 2021,positive,although its not the exact same as the 1984 version it does have parts included that are from the book which is a nice addition the cinematics are a great improvement from the original i recommend this movie to the fans of the original dune
Nov 8 2021,positive,over the top effects wow 
Nov 8 2021,positive,this movie should be seen in theaters  it wasnt just seeing it it was hearing and feeling it  not only was it beautifully shot the sound mixing is fantastic  i cant wait for part 2
Nov 8 2021,positive,a good movie that cant help feeling incomplete good thing a sequel is on the way
Nov 8 2021,positive,this movie was amazing the cast and the setting made you feel as if you were actually in the world of arrakis this was actually my second time seeing the movie and i saw some things i didnt see the first time which made me very excited my whole experience was wonderful and i cannot wait for part 2
Nov 8 2021,positive,action was great but violence was not gratuitous
Nov 8 2021,positive,epic in every sense lawrence of arabia meets star wars
Nov 8 2021,positive,it was good or should i say grand i saw it in an imax theater sometimes the sound was too much but the movie was true to the spirit of the book i am a fan of the dune  books and i liked this movie
Nov 8 2021,positive,interesting plot and lots of action
Nov 8 2021,positive,simply put dune is an overachieving film in 2021 particularly for scifi lovers though i wouldnt blame the casual movie goer for being a little lost and maybe checking the time near the 2 and 12 hour mark visuals that will make you think you are watching the next great thing in art and tech correctly and brilliantly scored correctly casted and acted and satisfied fans of the novel part 2 probably decides if this film becomes a classic 5 stars
Nov 8 2021,positive,i have almost no problems with this movie but the one problem i do have with it will most likely ruin the watching experience for the casual viewer my problem the way the story was adapted the original 1984 movie did a bad job at adapting the story and if im being honest this one barely did better for both movies i had people who had read the books and had done several deepdives into the lore of dune watching with me the amount of times they had to tell important information that was excluded from the movie was alarming not everyone has such a luxury and if i hadnt myself i would rated it way lower in short if youve read the books or watching with someone who did you will have a good viewing experience if not dont bother watching it     also one minor gripe is the advertising i thought it was very weird that despite being plastered all over the promotional material and being featured in the trailers zendaya was only in the movie for 7 minutes out of the 2 hours and 35 minutes that the move lasts for i get that it wouldnt have made sense to increase her role in this movie but really all that hype for 7 minutes the promotional material made it look as though she was a main character i understand this movie is just the first part of the full reboot so im certain the majority of her  screentime will be in the second part but why focus so much on a character that was in literally less than a half of a percent of the movie 004516129032
Nov 8 2021,positive,beautiful film leto could have been better definitely ready for part two
Nov 8 2021,positive,the best adaptation so long for the first dune book i love lynch version that i saw as a child but this one really manages to make the worldbuilding believable ive already seen the movie 3 times make sure to select a good theater with a great screen to go see it and enjoy the cinematography
Nov 8 2021,negative,so much hushed whispered mumbling by all of the actors its almost impossible to follow the complicated plot speak up
Nov 8 2021,positive,loved it so far its about as close to the book as you can get the only major change ie changing the sex of one of the characters doesnt interfere with the story great casting choices especially on the majors characters    cant wait to see the second half
Nov 8 2021,positive,one of the best movies of 2021 cant wait to dune part ii
Nov 8 2021,positive,the story is great music acting and characters they are taking their time with it no rushing the story so expect a sequel
Nov 8 2021,positive,absolutely loved this movie standout performances from timotheé chalamet and rebecca ferguson who add so much emotional depth to their characters and their motherson relationship dont go into this movie expecting a lot of action more of that will be in dune part 2 part 1 was essentially world building helping us understand the conflict the world and the characters
Nov 7 2021,positive,slow build and long movie well acted and very entertaining 
Nov 7 2021,positive,great intro to an exciting scifi world 
Nov 7 2021,positive,one of the best movies ive seen in a while
Nov 7 2021,positive,big screen movie very grand solid acting and moves through the story line well
Nov 7 2021,positive,this movie had both an excellent plot and stunning visuals and audio i have read the book and so watching the movie i understood all of the nuances of the story and the subplots of the characters which made the movie even better i think the decision to make dune into two parts is a good decision because the book is very long and complicated and trying to fit all of the content of the book into one movie would mean a lot of herberts storytelling would be lost speaking of which the movie was extremely loyal to the book more so than i have seen in any other movie and that is always something i look out for overall i think dune is an amazing movie and i am very excited for the sequel
Nov 7 2021,positive,although the plot is sometimes hard to follow the special effects and acting of rebecca ferguson and oscar isaac and tim chalamet provide a solid story line  its like a star wars but geared more for adults
Nov 7 2021,positive,i loved it amazing story line and amazingly put together
Nov 7 2021,positive,if you liked the book you will feel so happy they finally nailed it this is hard scifi its not for everyone if you want all action and jokes go watch a marvel movie this isnt that
Nov 7 2021,positive,i loved it  much better than the previous attempt to translate dune into a movie wonderful graphics casting and script
Nov 7 2021,positive,stunning in every way but it is part one see this in imax
Nov 7 2021,positive,visuals lack color and detail imo but pacing and exposition were good 6510 decent
Nov 7 2021,positive,enjoyable but hard to take such a prepubescent looking hero main character seriously
Nov 7 2021,positive,an amazing adaptation of the source material it felt a bit slow in the end on my first watch but after seeing it again and the visions fall into place they elevate the experience making this one of my favorite movies of all time it definetly acts as a first movie of a greater story but can stand on its own as a piece of art i cant wait for part ii
Nov 7 2021,positive,only got 4 cause a trilogy shouldnt take over 6 yes to complete
Nov 7 2021,positive,fantastic visuals but a very plot heavy film it definitely feels like the first part of a series if they hadnt confirmed part 2 then it would deserve 1 star
Nov 7 2021,positive,4092021 venezia a lovely hotel on one of venice main islands     a late vaporetto to the lido    the horror story begins 40 minutes of anxiousness on boat of whether i will be able to enter the premiere of dune or not     the vaporetto docks and i run for my life to the cinema for the premiere of dune they let me in    i silently find my way to my seat     oh    horror story 2 a seat in the first row for an imax  filmed movie     but at least i was there and i enjoyed every second of it     before i dive into the real review of the movie id like to give you some advice dont come late to dune and dont sit in the first row    luckily i managed to see dune once again in le grand rex in paris and this is the place to see the movie but dont sit there in the first row either    now that we have that out of the way lets dive into the review of the movie or shall i say masterpiece because that is what i really think of it     a lot of critics have said that denis villeneuves dune is slow and that nothing really happens in that movie i didnt feel that way at all for me the whole screening was full of tension i had no idea what would happen next and it kept me thinking what next it is true though that there is not a lot of action in the movie but is it necessary it focused more on the discovery and the appreciation of the planet arrakis and the power of its nature and its inhabitants it emphasised more on the message that we need to hear in these troubled times  the urge of taking care of our planet and all of life on it     it focused less on the action but also on the emotional journey of the main character paul atreides played in a sublime fashion by timothée chalamet     focusing on these two matters rather than on the action is what makes this movie exceptionally smooth and made me think that this is a beautiful overture to the dune trilogy one story in 3 parts even hans zimmers music made it feel this way every timeless movie needs a recognisable theme music and at first i really felt disappointed not to have heard it in dune then i thought that it must be all part of the plan this music felt also as did the whole movie like a beautiful introduction to a world this looks to me like a move made on purpose leaving space for development of both action and music in the next movies    denis villeneuve might become the first director to make every part of a trilogy better than the previous one     some scenes are especially touching as the one where paul artreides is parting home not only was this scene making us feel closer to paul and made him more human but it also was visually stunning the whole movie was breathtaking greig fraser the cinematographer of dune did an incredible job at composing the images for the movie and choosing sharper angles and colder colours for eery scenes matching contrasting slow motion with fast action shots and thus keeping the spectator in constant awe this effect was also due to the perfect symbiosis of image and sound the music and the voices were just wrapping around the audience as hans zimmer said on his instagram the sound mix accentuated the mellowness and the silkiness of the voices and combined it with the music and all the sound effects to create an astounding score    beautiful score stunning cinematography smooth acting and unique take on the movie  isnt this movie just perfect for me it had some imperfections but i dont think its worth diving into them i cant call them universal as opposed to all these good sides of the movies that ive covered     there is one thing that missed in the movie in my opinion one tiny thing it might be completely personal my gut felt quite okay after let me explain after movies like todd phillipss the joker or bon joon hos parasite my whole body was reacting to what i just saw i couldnt really think of other things without associating them with some scene from the movies and i felt some kind of anxiety when they ended maybe its just the fact that it didnt end on a cliff hanger   maybe
Nov 7 2021,positive,i was glad to see that the movie stuck so close to the book  thought casting was excellent
Nov 7 2021,positive,dont get me wrong i enjoyed the movie and im glad i saw it on the big screen  the visuals were amazing  but this is a movie i probably not want to watch again
Nov 7 2021,positive,i really enjoyed it thought im a fan of the book series and the old version  i was sad that we did not get more zendaya though  i guess that means that part 2 will be lots of timothy and zendaya     the music and sound space and practical stuff was truly inspiring as much as i weep over their budget p
Nov 7 2021,positive,one of the best aestethic experience ive ever had
Nov 7 2021,positive,loved everything about it can hardly wait for the second one
Nov 7 2021,negative,dreadful to many close ups no much darkness far to dull far to much mumbling brolin issacs momoa all good none of the other actors remotely captures what lynch got out of his actors
Nov 7 2021,negative,my 12 year old fell asleep it was entirely too long with nothing happening the visuals were good but the movie was too slow 
Nov 7 2021,negative,yawn  too long too boring bland actors bland costumes  just a slog  even the tense parts werent tense  and all this exposition and now were supposed to wait for the next movie  who cares at that point pass
Nov 7 2021,positive,after the mixed attempts of adapting frank herberts dune into live action denis villeneuves interpretation is not only faithful to the source material but achieves it in spectacular fashion dune is a masterclass of modern filmmaking   with a starstudded cast the film was expected to display many of the best performances of the year timothée chalamet brings the necessary gravitas to portray paul atreides one of scifis greatest characters he is everything expected of a lead protagonist and is quite possibly perfect casting another standout is stellan skarsgård as baron harkonnen his performance struck a balance between being a cruel yet cunning leader this doesnt come across as a caricature but skarsgård rather commands fear every time he is on screen however those excited to see zendaya will end up being disappointed as she has a grand total of around 7 minutes of screen time in the 155minute film the rest of the cast including rebecca ferguson oscar isaac josh brolin and javier bardem deliver standout performances across the board not one of them feel out of place in this intergalactic epic they add to the immersive world building experience carefully crafted by denis villeneuve   being the director of blade runner 2049 another visually arresting film i had no doubt that villeneuve could adapt dune successfully to the big screen what i had not anticipated however was just how impressive the cinematography the film would be from the first to the last scene each frame is akin to a work of art the masterful use of cgi throughout helps bring this universe to life villeneuve grounds these fantastical elements by showing them from the characters perspectives for example when we first see a sandworm paul is in the foreground on an ornihopter which allows us to realise the massive size of these creatures as the director said himself dune is made to be seen on the big screen with a score composed by the legendary hans zimmer the film should be experienced with the best sounds system possible as well whilst it augments the movie well the score fails to reflect the subtlety and finesse at which the rest of the film operates the powerful sounds make for a great experience in a cinema but are ultimately entirely forgettable however a film cannot solely rely on visual and auditory spectacle as it will inevitably not hold up over time dune balances this with an excellent adaptation of herberts plot making for a gripping and well told story and ensuring the film is not just style over substance  the biggest problem is the fact that it is only part one of the story with the opening shot of the film being the title card dune part one and closing with the words this is just the beginning it remains to be seen how this film holds up in the larger narrative unlike other multi part sagas such as the lord of the rings dune ends abruptly and lacks a traditional three act structure within this first instalment it very much does feel like a first part leaving the viewer somewhat unsatisfied the real test will be whether villeneuve can stick the landing in the next film set for 2023 this should not dissuade you from going to see dune made for the cinematic experience i would highly recommend watching one of the best films of the year so far
Nov 7 2021,positive,i wish it were longer
Nov 7 2021,positive,its the best sci fi movie ive ever watched
Nov 7 2021,positive,visually gorgeous and true to book
Nov 7 2021,positive,excellent treatment of a complicated text
Nov 7 2021,neutral,timothée chalamet is a fine actor but he hasnt anywhere near the gravitas required to carry a film like dune with his lush brown locks falling charmingly in his cherubic face chalemet looks like a posh schoolboy from a 1980s merchant ivory production not a natural warrior fulfilling some intergalactic destiny the special effects in dune are terrific of course and the cinematography compelling if a little dark at times but ultimately dune fails to fully succeed because chalamet just is not right for the main role of paul atreides son of duke leto atreides oscar isaac underused and overbearded ive never been jason momoas biggest fan but here momoa oozes the leading man charisma that chalamet lacks in his relatively minor role as a loyal warrior in the service of the duke and his family lots of really good actors are involved in this project john brolin stellan starsgard javier bardem and charlotte rampling among them but most of them have little or nothing to do rebecca ferguson as the mother of chalamets character does have a pretty significant role but shes too frosty for the audience to really care about her presumably zendaya who has a glorified camera will have a larger role in the sequel i would hope so because her role here is limited to appearing in some dreams and then at the sortof ending giving paul a sword for a fight in which the 150 pound chalamet manages to handily overwhelm a muscular seasoned warrior director denis villeneuve certainly brings a stylish touch to the proceedings but like his previous outing blade runner 2049 dune is more style than substance
Nov 7 2021,positive,i havent read the books on dune but i honestly loved the movie the music the story and the dialogues were greatly done hope the part two will do justice to the story overall the movie is a must watch if you are a scifi and cinematography lover
Nov 7 2021,positive,excellent ready for part 2
Nov 7 2021,positive,brilliant scenes stunning amazing acting the music was sensational what a thrill looking forward to the 2
Nov 7 2021,positive,everything about it is amazing
Nov 7 2021,negative,well spielbergs ai movie has long held the worst movie ever title for me but its just been bumped to position two who funds this garbage literally nothing noteworthy happens and what does happen could have been told in about 20 mins all that tech with the flying dragon flys and they run around stabbing each other with ivory knives save yourself 25 hours of your life and watch some paint drying
Nov 7 2021,positive,a coming of age space odyssey dune is an actionadventure story that showcases the true skill of both its director denis villeneuve and its cast first off the biggest praise i can give to this movie is its special effects and the computergenerated environments whether its the distinctive interior of buildings the bright and solitary oceans or the vast and dimly coloured deserts theyre all a sight for sore eyes secondly the writing is just on a whole other level the intellectuality behind some of the political dialogue is just phenomenal the way it handles such intricate themes as dictatorship religion and sovereignty is absolutely extraordinary the acting was another highlight of this feature timothée chalamet jason momoa josh brolin oscar isaac zendaya dave bautista stellan skarsgård rebecca ferguson theres just too many to name all of them deliver exquisite and masterful performances that improve the experience tenfold one issue that definitely hampers the experience however is its story structure when watching its very clear that they have an entire trilogy in mind the ending doesnt feel satisfying enough and theres barely a climax its very evident that this isnt the end but that unfortunately makes this chapter feel unfinished the pacing wasnt bad but it certainly couldve been better most of the movie is fine the exposition and dialogue scenes dont drag on and the action sequences dont end before theyve barely started but towards the end it feels like there are a couple of minutes of filler while it isnt a major issue its still something that couldve been ironed out on the other side the score delivered by hans zimmer is a jam every orchestrated piece is stunning and fits the vibe of the scene perfectly whether its an action setpiece or the exploration of the broad worlds its allencompassing and truly magical in short dune is everything both newcomers and fans of the original novel could hope for a fantastic interstellar opera that makes you hungry for more
Nov 7 2021,positive,this is an absolute must see the cinematography is seamless it is visually one of the best movies ever the cast is stacked with heavy hitters that do not leave anything on the table you will not be disappointed
Nov 7 2021,positive,although i was familiar with the source material and the 1984 david lynch version of dune the newest entrys spectacular special effects really captured the scope of the story and the directors interpretations of the nowfamiliar plot line serves to capture your attention anew  while the relationship between paul and gurney halleck seemed true to the 1984 film i liked the enhanced treatment of the relationship between paul and duncan idaho which captured a genuine almost familial bond in the mold of a big brotherlittle brother relationship  that of course makes the subsequent events all the more poignant   good film
Nov 7 2021,positive,well extremely well done i felt like they could have given it some more interesting concepts compared to the lynch film it feels a bit boring  everything however was done extremely well and tried to tell the story in a compelling manor
Nov 7 2021,positive,overall great movie only because there are other films planned else it ends poorly if looked at as a oneoff film  the only criticism is the sound mixing the music and sound effects are significantly louder than the voices making it difficult to understand what is being said  i even needed to rewind and turn on cc a few times which i hate because it detracts from the film experience  this is why i only gave it 35 stars
Nov 7 2021,positive,perfectly paced phenomenal visualization   dune done right
Nov 7 2021,positive,absolutely movie of the year great special effects and soundtrack by the wonderful hans zimmer the story is so true to the book even if they skipped the last part loved seeing this story finally come to life in the big screen in a very memorable and amazing film by denis villenueve timothée chalamet plays an excellent paul atreides
Nov 7 2021,positive,music a little over the top but it looks like they want to make this into a series this was part one which is great  the first book needs at lest 2 parts to tell it well but their are two more books in the series of the plant and several others books to continue the story
Nov 7 2021,positive,it was a hole experience it is without a doubt a masterpiece
Nov 7 2021,positive,great movie  rly liked it    i hope the next isnt bad because if it ends up shit  this movie by default gets worse    as is with all things set as a multi project  part thing
Nov 7 2021,positive,i have to say i was entertained while watching the movie
Nov 7 2021,positive,this epic science fiction film directed by denis villeneuve is the first of a planned twopart adaptation of the 1965 novel by frank herbert primarily covering the first half of the book set in the far future it follows paul atreides as his family the noble house atreides entrusted with the protection of the most valuable asset and most vital element in the galaxy is thrust into a war for the dangerous desert planet arrakis the stunning visuals and cinematography of the movie are just spellbinding and worth seeing on the big screen the plot is quite compelling despite being a bit intricate it is a whole new world waiting to be explored further and with so much potential hans zimmers inventive and aliensounding score is just phenomenal i expect many awards for this movie
Nov 7 2021,positive,the computer graphics and cinematography were brilliant this could be an academy award in the making the screenwriting was excellent the acting was superb there was a bit too much graphic violence
Nov 7 2021,positive,the best scifi film in years
Nov 7 2021,positive,amazing movie amazing music its a worth to watch especialy in 4dx 3d for a better experience
Nov 7 2021,positive,i saw the original and loved it bought it and saw it dozens of times  for the time that it was made the effects were great etc until we my husband and i saw this movie  we were blown out of the water  this movie was outstanding   it almost makes the first one seem campy   my husband read the book he states that this one follows the book more closely  it has a more serious somber spiritual tone  loved the costumes music everything  the only thing that was missing was the chemistry between the duke and jessica  wasnt feeling it  but anxious to see the next one
Nov 7 2021,positive,i enjoyed it so much that i felt like reading the books let the second part come with the same director producers crew and actors
Nov 7 2021,negative,it was slow moving at times
Nov 7 2021,positive,i liked this movie eventho the pacing was at times a little too slow for me i understand why they did it when you finally understood the worldbuilding and knew what actually was happing it turned into an epic experience
Nov 7 2021,positive,villeneuves dune is an absolute must watch it seems that the talented director has mastered his craft with his last entry be warned this is only part 1 of the film and it is quite slow that said this did not bother me at all quite the opposite i felt like it added to the viewing experience the music was amazing the acting was amazing and the visuals were amazing the only problem with this film was that we need to wait for the next one in the meantime i shall go and watch it again in the cinema to pass the time
Nov 7 2021,positive,plot delivery was beautiful alongside with its visuals some of the terms said can be confusing regardless if you will learn more of the lore you will be immersed to the story casting is also outstanding with their great performances this is recommended to those who enjoy a fantasy with an amazing lore rewatchability value of the movie is high
Nov 7 2021,negative,2h 45 min and they only arrive at the aborigines creators  r u crazy is it going to the same boring sequels ugly cloth ugly machines ugly landscapes cities  nothing to look at especially on big scree if i didnt see the 1984 movie i wouldnt know what is going on
Nov 7 2021,positive,dune is brought masterfully to life by a director and cast at their collective peak
Nov 7 2021,positive,was at first very sceptical   after having seen it if you havent  go and see this adaption of dune its excellent   it was the right decision by villeneuve to bitri sect it there is and end to the story focused on in part 1   as almost everyone said music visual experience effects are great   dune manages extremely well to let the viewer slowly fall into the amount of intrigue and deception that is meant to serve the foundations of this empirea world system
Nov 7 2021,positive,amazing  ive read the whole series all 6 books 3 times and this movie did justice to the story  it was incredibly immersive and did not feel like a 25 hour movie  cannot wait to see part 2
Nov 7 2021,positive,dune was excellent the music and the cinematography was fantastic the story closely followed the books and told the story in a clear and concise way definitely want to see it on the biggest screen possible
Nov 7 2021,positive,great movie for long time fans of the book  i read it in 1973  my friend has all f the characters memorised  good job keeping the plot clear as the story moved along  some good strong roles for the two or three women in major parts but it is really a movie for menor people who like swords and explosions  it is a coming of age story about a boy discovering his power not unlike harry potter or even bilbo baggins  excellent acting and wonderful costumes although they were mostly monochromatic with just a few spaces of color once in a while  be aware that this is only part one and part two wont be out until 2023  if youre a classic science fiction fan you will enjoy reading the book  there are sequels as well but i didnt like them as much as the original dune by frank herbert    the credits at the end list about 2000 people who worked on every aspect of the film  pretty sure it will at least be nominated for some big awards
Nov 7 2021,positive,beautiful film compelling storyline great characters stunning cinematography and the usual brilliance from hans zimmer
Nov 7 2021,neutral,dune is beautiful the best visual adaptation so far however disappointingly it is a complete remake of the 84 version is flawed has some miscastings although some perfect ones as well and sadly builds the world worse and sets up dune lore worse than the 84 version this is getting too much love and the eternals is getting too much hate what on earth is going on around here
Nov 7 2021,positive,i have seen the original multiple times i would go so far as to say that i loved the original and all the characters however my biggest issue was always the complexity i really didnt understand the original until i read the book so the director failed in that facet the new movie was incredible i read some of the negative comments and i have to laugh i am not sure what some of these people were watching to each their own i guess the director did an awesome job explaining the story and developing the character the special effects and cinematography were exceptional my only gripe was that now we have to wait who knows how long for part 2 fantastic movie 
Nov 7 2021,positive,very immersive storygreat cinematography and costumes  the first iteration of the movie a number of years ago was not very good so i was apprehensive about going and now i am glad my adult son wanted to see it  well worth it
Nov 7 2021,positive,just amazing has to be seen in imax
Nov 7 2021,positive,denis is the master and he never fails to deliver a visual masterpiece unfortunately the should of the film is a tad deadened and therefore the emotional center does not hold however it is wonderfully cast and acted superbly directed and stunningly shot definitely worth the slow burn spice dive and i will be seeing part 2 should denis be at the helm
Nov 7 2021,positive, non spoiler review of dune    probably the most anticipated scifi film of the year i had no prior knowledge of dune going in i know it was based off a series of books and a tv movie in the 80s     as for this film it is a beautifully shot cinematic experience the acting from timothée chalamet oscar isaac zendaya and rebecca ferguson is excellent the story itself is dense lots of political moves and betrayals that motivate certain characters     the story was interesting but it was very slow in some spots that have you waiting for something to happen when the action happens its good its not star wars or even star trek level action but good as a two half hour film you do feel the length the ending is definitely a setup for a sequel that i hope we get    overall i did enjoy the film but i wasnt blown away this may not appeal to everybody but it was a very well made film if youre on the fence about going to the theater to see it you may want to watch it on hbo max     grade   
Nov 7 2021,positive,a good story great acting and excellent directing dune completely immerses the viewer into a different world and into the lives of the characters a slow burner that doesnt fit the hollywood movie script format dune tells the introduction to a story that leaves the viewer wanting more
Nov 7 2021,positive,having been a fan of dune for years this new version was visually stunning and reflected visually and accurately what i believe frank herbert conveyed in his brilliant written work the complex story line required slower pacing in the beginning but as the film progresses so did the action glad they are dividing up the story so they can include the richness of intrigue and plot lines excellent first film
Nov 7 2021,positive,cant wait to see the next one
Nov 7 2021,positive,this movie was eye candy i feel they rushed some parts there was a lot that was left unexplained but if youve seen anything earlier or read the books you know exactly whats going on
Nov 7 2021,positive,it requires patience and an open mind having said that its a fantastic adaptation
Nov 7 2021,negative,so boring and unkind to newbie  next film is needed
Nov 7 2021,positive,by far the best film adaptation to date of a complex novel well done cant wait for part 2
Nov 7 2021,positive,walked in with not much of an idea of what i should expect completely blown away
Nov 7 2021,positive,dune is ambitious which for the most part is a good thing there is a ton of worldbuilding to be done and while that makes the first act a little slow its worth it not just for this movie but also for the ones to follow it the cinematography is amazing denis villeneuve has always had a good eye for scale and it works very well here to flesh out the universe the cast is also strong stellan skarsgaards performance was my personal favorite as for negatives the movie is only the first part and it will to an extent be judged on how well the next movie pays off its setup i also think the movie could have been stronger emotionally
Nov 7 2021,positive,while liked the movie my wife who is not a huge dune fanatic had no idea what was going on a lot of the time the setting the costumes the scenery and the ambience were great but if you dont know the story there was not a whole lot of explaining happening and a lot would be missed if you didnt have a baseline knowledge of the dune world
Nov 7 2021,positive,loved the intense music actorswhats not to love about it
Nov 7 2021,positive,well done great presentation of conditions as could be imagined in following heberts creation look forward to a continuation of the story line as the saga continues
Nov 7 2021,positive,the movie is overrated the story is kinda complex which confuse who are who the film are too long and all scenes has the same rhythm i wished this movies were better in the war scene at least my 2 and half hours i could say well spent but now i will go to do my work report hoping thats the number are better for tomorrow meeting
Nov 7 2021,positive,great cast great effects great soundtrack great movie adapts the book very well you must see this on the big screen
Nov 7 2021,positive,i was going into this movie comparing it to the trash 1984 movie i just saw but wow i was mazed on how great this movie was i saw it 4 times and i reserve that just for the great movies good story and action they just should not have cut it off in mid scene
Nov 7 2021,negative,i saw this movie last night i read the book saw the other adaptations while my girlfriend never saw anything  we did not enjoy the movie and to be honest im happy we could not go to the cinema and ended renting it  the movie was very slow in some parts added things that did not exist but jumped relevant elements and important explainations of the dune universe considering the number of things omitted you could have made 1 film not a trilogy to me it was simply boring with useless in some cases completely made up fillers  also we stopped several times the movie because things werent clear to my gf and i had to explain things since noone explained nothing  if you have read the book or seen other adaptations watch this film to make an exercise of what you remember if you havent you will not understand much  good cgi great photography poor representation of the universe too loud
Nov 7 2021,positive,as a dune fan i liked it could have been even longer to expand more on the characters
Nov 7 2021,positive,superb from casting to wardrobe to visual effects
Nov 7 2021,positive,ummm lots of sandlack of plotgreat graphics but where is the story goingwhy is there another one   there was lots of distracting non topic videodidnt need to be that long for the little amount of storyline there really was
Nov 7 2021,positive,the movie is very faithful to the book  although plot is complex it wasnt difficult to follow and didnt get bogged down like the 80s version  my 15 and 16 year olds who have attention spans of gnats were completely engrossed
Nov 7 2021,positive,as a fan of the books i was a bit anxious about its scope of adaptation as a live action movie but in the hands of a master film maker like denis villeneuve anything can be done to perfection so coming to the movie i totally digged the vibe of the movie throughout its duration its a perfect adaptation in terms of creating an ambience worldbuilding for the characters to play their party in a vastly complicated story surprisingly the cinematography also is on par with the level of direction props to greig fraser  also the music overall hand zimmer just stepped up his own level of talent with this number the performances were also great especially rebecca duncan  timothee although its a fast flowing but repatively slow paced movie the depth of the characters the purpose were very plausibly conveyed to the audience some lagging in the screenplay was shadowed and even elevated by masterul technical performances all in all its on of the best movies of the year  also definitely one of the best cinematic experience in recent times denis villeneuve is born for movies like dune blade runner obviously i cant get enough of the guy solid 10s in all the departments dune is a masterpiece
Nov 7 2021,positive,i loved the architecture of everything the minimalism and the evolution of technology and robotics spacecraft spaceships how we embrace a natural way of medicine vegan omg i loved it so much
Nov 7 2021,positive,visually dynamic with excellent character development storyline is intriguing and not fully predictable enjoyable for mist audiences
Nov 7 2021,positive,i thought it was awesome the actors were perfect the story were excellent and the music was outstanding
Nov 7 2021,positive,it is what cine should always be like beautiful
Nov 7 2021,positive,visually stunning but rather slow it is a movie meant for the movie theaters good cgi especially with the worms the high point of the movie the big name actors in the film did a good job the actor who they had played paul was no kyle mclaughlin  he lacked the presence and i thought he was on one emotional note through the whole movie josh brolin was underused i saw it in 3d i may go back  and see it in imax zendaya seemed to be on a model photo shoot dr heuys character was underdeveloped and he was an important character in the movie 
Nov 7 2021,positive,didnt know it was a book but enjoyed it a little confused but still enjoyed it and was not too lost
Nov 7 2021,negative,boring and slow glad i watched it on hbo i hate falling asleep in theaters most characters are now blips what happened to the emperor and the navigators the baron is a blip of a character with no personality from the previews cinematography and visuals were nice but dont make up for the speed it moved
Nov 7 2021,negative,okay im not sure why the reviews are so high for this movie but it is what it is  this movie was incredibly boring    like omg  i couldnt even follow it that well and i really wanted to like this one but it was just so boring    good thing i didnt see it in theaters i saw it on hbo max
Nov 7 2021,positive,great movie  looking forward to sequel
Nov 7 2021,negative,nice effects and great casting but it is very long and very boring
Nov 7 2021,positive,anothe masterpiece from dennis villenueve cant wait for the second part
Nov 7 2021,positive,great special affects  great story
Nov 7 2021,positive,visually captivating a spot on adaptation of the original story helped further by the amazing performances of all on screen the films soundtrack is beautiful and interestingly unique accompanying the story perfectly action was spread out but when there was action you knew about it the characters were interesting enough enough to keep the pace rolling and at no point did i find the film too slow my only problem with dune was the abrupt ending as we leave the characters mere moments after the start of a new plot point
Nov 7 2021,negative,plot impossible to follow unless one had read the book or seen the earlier version  sound too loud  good visual special effects
Nov 7 2021,positive,watched the new dune movie last night  without having read the book it was awesome  paul atreides reminds me of te lawrence if he were descended from mycenaean kings and went on to be a mohammed himself  everything feels like it could actually take place in our future and feels in line with real world historical entities patterns etc  very refreshing from other sci fi which can overwhelm you with an endless supply of randomly spawned alien races all making deals and bickering in taverns and senate houses  you get a sense of the scale of the empire in dune without them stuffing it all into every place
Nov 7 2021,positive,its really close to the source material the visuals are just mesmerizing the acting is very good particularly those of timothée chalamet and rebecca ferguson it is a great introduction to the universe
Nov 7 2021,positive,as a long time fan of frank herberts work and of his son brian  kevin j andersons continued storytelling in his world i can say this is the best visualization ive seen so far i eagerly await part 2  gaurdedly hope that they will continue with all the books just so i can see what ive only pictured in my mind when i read
Nov 7 2021,positive,loved it had read the books many years ago abs very happy with the adaptation felt it ended at a logical point too and you could feel the end was coming for ten minutes or so    if you have no knowledge of the story or dune universe i think youll be fine it skins over some of the less important elements but youll lose nothing from the key story points as its cleverly done
Nov 7 2021,positive,i just wish the director had chosen a less anticlimatic point to stop the story at cant wait too see part 2 though
Nov 7 2021,positive,incredible from start to finish only wish the second part could come sooner
Nov 7 2021,positive,it was hard for me to follow the movie
Nov 7 2021,negative,boring long uncut lazy inexpressive faded viscous empty cold unfinished
Nov 7 2021,positive,amazing work it is a great moviendo and it shows the inspiration of the book i have bien a great fan of dune and i feel sarisfated with this work i have bien waiting the seco second part
Nov 7 2021,negative,so i saw this expecting it to be a masterpiece with how people praised it so disappointed the film expects audiences to understand a lot of dune lore to enjoy this film think the hype for this director being the next nolan is wrong too the cast are all big names but still didnt enjoy this one the sudden ending also left me feeling finally its over rather than excited for any potential sequels it gets if you want to watch an entertaining version of this see the original dune not this one 110
Nov 7 2021,positive,seriously such a good movie i cant wait for the next one the set it up so well and story line was great good introduction of characters
Nov 7 2021,positive,loved the original but this adaptation is simply incrediblecant wait for the second installment my only gripe is that this film is incredibly loud  the sound was so unbalanced that i was thankful to watch it with subtitles on hbomax otherwise i would have missed half the dialogue
Nov 7 2021,positive,absolutely incredible
Nov 7 2021,positive,mindblowing interpretation of dune by denis villenerve a mustsee for 2021 the cinematic experience is breathtaking and nothing like you have seen before
Nov 7 2021,positive,respects the source material and takes several scenes in new directions my only complaint is that in the book the heat of dune seemed to be a much bigger deal
Nov 7 2021,positive,real enjoyed the movie but you must watch it on imax   i have never finished reading the book but have seen all the movie  tv adaptions i can understand from star wars episode one the politics caused the story momentum to come to a stop this movie does not let the intense politics over take the story but it does lack some details about what is going on behind the scenes that drive some characters sadly we have to wait for part 2
Nov 7 2021,positive,great story plot cant wait for the next one
Nov 7 2021,positive,thought it was a big improvement over the first movie not sure i like having to wait for part 2
Nov 7 2021,negative,movie was hard to understand and way too long dont recommend
Nov 7 2021,positive,very stylistic and loved the cinematography
Nov 7 2021,positive,bless the maker and his water just shy of brilliant maybe until part 2 all the complaints about there being no context or backstory sort of miss the point of a director respecting the audience enough to immerse us in the story as it happens dv follows the book and builds a living breathing world instead of feeding it to us 
Nov 7 2021,negative,terrible awful poorly connived gotta believe these are all fake reviews because no one who watched it and stayed awake would like it
Nov 7 2021,positive,absolutely breathtaking on a technical level dune is a truly immersive experience that matches its narrative and worldbuilding with its grand ambition on an epic scale
Nov 7 2021,positive,one of the best movies ive ever seen
Nov 7 2021,positive,i knew about dune before watching this movie but never took the time to dive into the series until watching this film its a pretty good representation of the first part of the book i love timothee as paul  but the whole cast was great i havent been this excited about a series since game of thrones cant wait for the next one and hopefully more 
Nov 7 2021,positive,enjoyed it  but music was overwhelming at times  wished it would just go quiet for a bit
Nov 7 2021,positive,there wasnt a single thing i didnt dislike about the film if anything i cant wait for chapter 2 excellent cast story live very close to the book
Nov 7 2021,positive,this is the latest in a string of spectacular science fiction movies inc blade runner 2049 interstellar inception and tenet that do not hide away from complexity dune is a little thinner on ideas than some of these examples but this is more than compensated by the incredible visuals
Nov 7 2021,positive,i liked the visual spectacle and the sound design the acting was a bit dry and i didnt really care as much as i was asked to about the characters my criticism is that a feminist perspective was wasted i did like the big fight scenes and thought overall the narrative was pushed along fairly true to the book
Nov 7 2021,positive,great movie with a wonderful score
Nov 7 2021,positive,fantastic movie great acting i like the story kept me engaged till the end highly recommend and i cant for the next chapter
Nov 7 2021,positive,i agree with nate zs review at least partially the first dune movie followed my reading this incredible book that took frank herbert about 8 years to write that impressed me as to how well thought out the story was the first movie left me feeling unfulfilled really unfulfilled i had heard that it was cut from 8 hours to fit in to the theaters so i read the book again and again 5  times total as well as the smaller sequels a couple of times with this new addition to the story i was shocked to find out that after 34s of the way through it wasnt 34s of the way through this book that meant there was more of the story to come i hope its a big box office success because it is so well done in telling herberts story villeneuve has really succeeded in getting the story on film i sincerely hope hes able to do a second part and even a third if necessary  at least then in the future one will be able to watch it all in the future like i can now enjoy bond without having to wait a year between books and films i have to see it in a theater now thanks to what nate z said gls
Nov 7 2021,positive,only downside is the end leaves you totally hanging for part ii
Nov 7 2021,positive,never saw the original was immediately disappointed when it started and tells u its not a complete story and theres gonna be at least a sequel underdeveloped characters but great cast
Nov 7 2021,positive,acting was terrific and thoughtful use of supernatural elements were effective and highly inventive looking forward to the second part
Nov 7 2021,positive,fantastic very much how i envisioned it from the book i am glad they opted to back it in to multiple movies the scope of the stories demand it part one ends at a the right place in the story line i cant wait for part two
Nov 7 2021,positive,excellent job with part 1  cant wait for part 2
Nov 7 2021,positive,the best movie this year it lives up to the book and im so happy that they are making a part two well acted and word of mouth is why this movie is continuing to perform well even through covid a must watch for the entire family 
Nov 7 2021,positive,good movie not enough zedaya
Nov 7 2021,neutral,although this was an improvement over the 80s version it seems that no one can translate the book into a decent movie  it is very slow somewhat confusing and rather lackluster in entertainment i had a hard time staying awake  zendaya is shown often in the trailer but had about 10 lines in the whole movie  i love a good scify film but couldnt get into this one
Nov 7 2021,positive,loved the actors and storyline but felt the music for the movie fell short
Nov 7 2021,positive,a little confusing and slow but sets up an even better movie to come in a few years
Nov 7 2021,negative,this has to be the worst movie ive seen it was long boring and i kept waiting for something to freaking make me feel like staying there for three hours hours
Nov 7 2021,positive,it was an ok movie politics set in science fiction not sure what all the hype is about
Nov 7 2021,negative,fabulous special effects that somehow didnt mesh with the subpar acting and the choppy dialogue it would be hard to discern whether this hohum spectacular was a comedy or a spoof without the background visuals and the hyperdramatic sound flavorless eye candy
Nov 7 2021,positive,loved this movie fantastic although it may be difficult to follow the story  still the visuals and acting is excellent
Nov 7 2021,positive,loved this movie excited for whats next
Nov 7 2021,positive,watched it twice miles more understandable and superior to the 1984 david lynch adaptation luv the dragonfly helicopter momoa steals the show with the only bit of humour throughout dunno if wed get to see part 2 and conclusion of the book ever
Nov 7 2021,positive,beautiful stunning to the eyes interpretation of frank herberts dune loved it
Nov 7 2021,negative,i think that the movie was a waste of 3 hours because it gave no context and just threw the viewers to the wolves i want to punch the man who made this film in the face this movie should be banned in the united states if you think this movie was good you should take a mental evaluation ill buy a physical copy just so i can urinate on it everyday i wake up
Nov 7 2021,positive,denis villeneuve definitely has a thing for rescuing or continuing where others left off and in my opinion does it well enough to be lauded for that alone i saw the david lean movie on home video and couldnt follow the plot it was a mess but i thought the casting and effects were good up to a point  this is a very different film and although i would have liked more back story on the emperor  hence the lack of 5 stars i assume this is provided in the book which i havent even picked up let alone read  i think theres enough here to provide an epic film which is visually stunning with a great soundtrack casting is fine i think a follow up would answer the critics of any of the leads  also i saw it in a 4dmax cinema which just adds to the spectacle i would like to see it again in imax because the visuals are simply amazing and the set design is worth seeing on a big screen to appreciate the effort put in here
Nov 7 2021,positive,absolutely beautiful      
Nov 7 2021,positive,good music would have liked to see subtitle in english as in some places the language was not english
Nov 7 2021,negative,bad no backstory dark too quiet sometimes i didnt know what the heck was going on
Nov 7 2021,positive,i would have rated it higher i did really like it but i felt unsatisfied when the movie was over it felt too long and too short at the same time
Nov 7 2021,positive,awesome when is the next one coming out
Nov 7 2021,positive,overall it was good a bit long kinda wish they wrapped things up more but i guess it was a true part 1
Nov 7 2021,positive,not badbut the dialog was difficult to follow we found ourselves wishing for subtitles maybe the sound balance was off in our theatre but background noise drowned out voices and if background sound wasnt the problem a lot of the dialog sounded either muffled or as if the actors were not adequately enunciating if we hadnt been familiar with the story i think we would have been pretty lost visually quite spectacular
Nov 7 2021,positive,the actors and actresses were an awesome combination
Nov 7 2021,positive,beautiful scenes and grand themes  great acting too
Nov 7 2021,positive,brilliant  dv knew the material  understood it at its core  perfectly captures the story visually and at its essence  excellent casting  tc is outstanding as paul  was not thrilled with jms casting as duncan idaho but he was wonderful  the heart of the movie  i loved the lynch version even though it did not quite work  it was a beautiful but flawed film  this is flawless
Nov 7 2021,positive,this is the greatest science fiction movie of all time in my opinion
Nov 7 2021,positive,great visuals characters are done quite well
Nov 7 2021,positive,i didnt know anything about dune going into this movie didnt watch the original didnt read the books i went into this completely blinded i just wanted to support the cast but after watching it  i enjoyed how it was shit visually and why did they end the movie like that i definitely get why we are getting a part 2 cause that was definitely a cliffhanger
Nov 7 2021,positive,loved it better than i even hoped
Nov 7 2021,positive,a true epic and a mustwatch on the big screen
Nov 7 2021,positive,had no context or understanding for the movie going into it i really like the introduction to the possible new universe building series 
Nov 7 2021,positive,awesome they better make part 2
Nov 7 2021,positive,beautiful adaptation of the first half of frank herberts dune
Nov 7 2021,positive,good movie great story great cast  its going to lead to big action  cant wait for part two
Nov 7 2021,positive,follows the book well amazing effects beautiful cinematography must see on the big screen cant wait for the next one
Nov 7 2021,positive,please go watch this movie you need this
Nov 7 2021,positive,great film some changes are amazing some changes are not zendaya though no other actress out there who actually knows how to act anyway cant wait for the next part
Nov 7 2021,positive,absolutely amazing great story great acting great visuals everything you want in a good movie
Nov 7 2021,positive,just amazing from beginning to end every single person that worked on this movie deserves to be congratulated
Nov 7 2021,negative,zero character or story development audience baiting trailer shots that were so segmented and never realized this movie makes eternals look like a masterpiece
Nov 7 2021,negative,i didnt expect this type movie
Nov 7 2021,positive,incredible seen it twice already and plan to watch over and over again
Nov 7 2021,positive,fantastic well worth the watch rebecca ferguson and charlotte rampling were giving us everything
Nov 7 2021,positive,exceeded expectationsfirst time in a while  i reread the 1st 3 dune books following hurricane ida when everything was out  my wife who does not like sci fi surprised me when she said she liked the movie and followed the plot  she even was disappointed when the movie ended and has to wait for part 2
Nov 7 2021,positive,dune is visually stunning and has a very intriguing story  the problems are that i dont have an emotional connection to the characters i dont know most of their names and theres no ending
Nov 7 2021,positive,loved it great casting
Nov 6 2021,positive,a wonderful adaptation of the classic frank herbert novel that was very true in spirit to the novel and yet the novel did not have to be read to appreciate the film  looking forward already to the sequel
Nov 6 2021,negative,boring but that wasnt a surprise for a movie from denis villeneuve
Nov 6 2021,positive,very good even better than expected
Nov 6 2021,negative,2 stars because it looked amazing on the big screen cinematography was on point pretty confusing plot and i think weve all had our fill of sandworms and glutton evil emperors at this point not worth a rewatch
Nov 6 2021,positive,slow and boring at times was it originally made for a tv show or   sound effects design was overpowered by the zimmer music  very polished imageryalmost too clean and too much cgimostly wide landscape shots  not enough practical effects especially with suits and tech stuffreally needs more emotion in general this movie the fight scenes were poorly filmed and you just disconnect because it is all very pretty and cool all are way too cool except the mother she was spoton great concept art and nice picture felt like café latte but was expecting nano quantum teenage angst redbullswords where awsome meh
Nov 6 2021,positive,great visuals sound design soundtrack and casting it has the feeling of being the start of something big
Nov 6 2021,positive,amazing movie way better then the original
Nov 6 2021,negative,i found the lighting to be particularly awful and uninspiring the story line dragged and in many of the scenes the actors mumbled i wished for subtitles as it stands at present the dune predecessor was superior
Nov 6 2021,negative,absolute bore probably the worst casting in the history of cinema total waste of time if you loved the book acoustic this movie
Nov 6 2021,positive,awesome movie way better than the 1984 version
Nov 6 2021,positive,highly stylised with an enveloping soundtrack every moment felt uncertain
Nov 6 2021,positive,i was so lost the movie ended and i still had no idea what was going on for a first time watcher like me it was tough to paint the overall picture
Nov 6 2021,positive,my favorite movie in years beautiful deep and kept me wanting more ive seen it twice and i will watch it again well done
Nov 6 2021,positive,i am a huge lover of the books and i think this was a worthy adaptation of the beginning of this story  the acting and directing were really on point  the only slightly disappointing thing was the placement of the ending but i there is no way this story could have been properly told in 1 movie  i really hope they do actually make the 2nd movie
Nov 6 2021,positive,well done best adaptation yet cant wait for part two
Nov 6 2021,positive,absolutely awesome spectacle great conceptualisation of an epic tale true enough to the spirit of the novels great characterisation fabulous performances fantastic cinematography best movie ive seen for a long while
Nov 6 2021,positive,i was personally super at how easy to manage and understand the story and its characters with all the rustle about the movie and the books from before  i am super excited and invested of what comes next the allegories the relationships and the world building aspects to come  only disappointed with the amount of discrepancy from promoting zendaya and her actual input to this story
Nov 6 2021,positive,beautiful cinematography lovely acting for those unfamiliar with the story may be difficult to follow
Nov 6 2021,positive,amazing  best movie of 2021
Nov 6 2021,negative,very slow movingnothing memorable very dull
Nov 6 2021,negative,slow and boring sound was awful and thats something i rarely notice  either too loud and thumping or so soft couldnt hear what the actor said
Nov 6 2021,positive,very impressive  definitely need to see it on a large screen all the actors did a great job script was great cant wait for part 2
Nov 6 2021,positive,well directed and visually stunning without too many quickly edited scenes and sensationalized the political landscape is not as developed in at the as the old movie
Nov 6 2021,negative,after much deliberation i watched this version of the story  sadly it offers little variation to the earlier versions and the fancy graphics dont make up for a story which is now old and superseded by others that remain far more entertaining  a missed opportunity yet again
Nov 6 2021,positive,great actingactors special effects story  loved it
Nov 6 2021,positive,dune is a scifi epic that is both shot and directed in a way that makes you immersed in this amazing world with its phenomenal cast that are very satisfying to see on screen as well as the amazing score that make some of the scenes dramatic and full of suspense
Nov 6 2021,positive,the background noises were too loud at several points  the dialogue was close to being drowned out  however i am 68 and perhaps that is the real problem
Nov 6 2021,positive,i love the dune story and this movie was so much more than i couldve hoped for  its beautiful epic and deep  the only problem with this movie is that it ends
Nov 6 2021,positive,so much better than the original
Nov 6 2021,positive,elegantly filmed building up the mood visually engaging but at times a little long looking forward to the next installment
Nov 6 2021,negative,to long for no reason boring 
Nov 6 2021,positive,the most visually stunning movie to date imho closer to the herbert tome than anything yet made a few little things that stray from the book but i dont consider them significant a few additional details too that enriched the story i give my highest praise even my nonscifi daughter enjoyed it 
Nov 6 2021,positive,beautiful but slow deliberately confusing and unsatisfying as a whole story  not like other part 1 films lotr deathly hallows where the part 1 still felt like a whole movie  this one feels like its barely begun
Nov 6 2021,positive,its a real crime not seeing this move in the cinema so move you fat ass of the couch and go see this absolute masterpiece
Nov 6 2021,positive,loved the landscapes and the music they setup a great background for the awesome cast to tell the story
Nov 6 2021,positive,pro great cinematography pro great acting pro beautiful score pro the directors visualization of the script represented really well con for me there was some pacing issues some scenes were unnecessarily too long or too short 
Nov 6 2021,positive,better more detailed story line they did not try and condense the story great characters emphasized instead of a time factor the special effects were top notch a true scifi movie classic
Nov 6 2021,positive,dune 2021 is a completely emersive and otherworldly experience  its one of the best films ive seen in years and greatly anticipate the continuation of the story
Nov 6 2021,positive,great beginning to an excellent story i loved the book and feared the attempt at a movie would once again suffer  the 2021 movie did not suffer great performances mind blowing scenery  well worth seeing on the big screen
Nov 6 2021,positive,best blockbuster of the year its an achievement
Nov 6 2021,positive,sand the sand was cool
Nov 6 2021,positive,a great adaptation of the book but can be a little confusing for some that have not read the first book 12 star  bring a knowledgeable friend to explain some things  amazing music sounds visuals atmosphere etc
Nov 6 2021,positive,great movie it holds very tight to the book but is still approachable for those who havent read it im really looking forward to part 2
Nov 6 2021,positive,genuinely amazing never once got bored surprisingly
Nov 6 2021,positive,this film is way way better than the original the effects alone are worth the watch that said it moves pretty slow i found it pretty uninspiring i might like it more after i see part ii
Nov 6 2021,positive,this is one of the cinematographic masterpieces of our generation
Nov 6 2021,positive,definitely a movie you have to see in theaters ots visually beautiful with great acting
Nov 6 2021,positive,this is definitely my 1 favorite movie of 2021 since it brought back a dear part of my childhood and made it much better than ever while just being a delicious appetizer for a 2023 main course that was greenlit the day after my birthday
Nov 6 2021,positive,big fan of the original  loved this version too
Nov 6 2021,negative,visually the movie is beautiful but is like a a lot of disconnected pieces i felt it just did not flow from one scene to another it does not explain well the world the action is settled in and all the politics it left out information about face dancers and tleilaxu did not explained well how noble houses work  the politics the weapons  shields it did not get me emotionally connected to the characters  i could not care less who lived and died  lady jessica and paul are showed being weak and too emotional  yes she worries about her son but she is a trained bene gesserit and he is indeed afraid of the future he can see but they are never weak  they both manipulated the fremen to survive and get back in power i saw all the other movie versions and even if they were not as good as the epic book they were all better than this 
Nov 6 2021,positive,very well done  super true to the book and perfect casting
Nov 6 2021,positive,movie was fabulous a must see movie and helloooo jason momoa is in it do i need too say more all the actors in this movie rock
Nov 6 2021,positive,found it a bit boring and overly dramatic even in moments that didnt need to be i understand theres plenty of source material to condense into a movie but i actually felt that certain scenes couldve been cut or shortened found myself constantly waiting for action that never came also wish we couldve seen more of the desert worm maybe in part 2
Nov 6 2021,positive,one of the most if not the most visually stunning movies ever made all the actors really embraced the motivations of their characters cannot wait for part ii
Nov 6 2021,positive,was a great story looking forward to hard to
Nov 6 2021,positive,excellent movie very well done
Nov 6 2021,neutral,its half of a movie so it gets a half rating
Nov 6 2021,positive,epic incredible world building great characters and performances cant wait for part two only criticism i have is a little more action in the next one please
Nov 6 2021,positive,going into this movie i didnt know what to expect i havent read the books i havent looked up the lore i watched part of the 1984 movie when i was around 12 years old and didnt understand what i was watching  and that was over 30 years ago so i was apprehensive about how this movie would capture my attention explain to me the story and introduce me to the characters of a brand new franchise a tall order its a tough job to get right  but knowing the director actors and composer had all hit home runs in the past  i was hopeful by the end of this movie my eyes were full of wonder my mind was racing with ideas and concepts of this new universe and my heart was invested in the stories of these new characters and the score right from the start i was gripped by how unique impressive and immersive the music was it belongs to this movie it is iconic well done the cast is perfect i soaked up every second of acting and immediately understood their relationships  motivations the cgi was near flawless i never felt like i was looking at something that wasnt really there  it was immersive and seamless excellent work im so happy that this is a part one i cant wait for part 2 im excited to see where this goes and im hoping that the last line of the movie holds true this is just the beginning
Nov 6 2021,positive,dune was an excellent space scifi film despite some of the somewhat bad cgi in it i found myself capable of looking past it unlike other films the acting was excellent which is a skill hollywood is lacking recently i havnt read any of the books apparently there are several and the story and lore were engaging and intriguing     my only problem was that this film did not need the run time it had there were way too many long shots of different characters looking into the distance way too many unnecessary slow motion shots and i get it paul has visions lets move on     anyways i would totally recommend this film to anyone who enjoys space scifi films
Nov 6 2021,positive,amazing world building i knew almost nothing about the backstory and it was an amazing to be wrapped up in the dune universe cant recommend this movie enough just one hint for anyone that doesnt know anything about it pauls visions are about possible futures not necessarily whats going to happen
Nov 6 2021,positive,i loved this film so much and just can not wait for more the world that was built glorious zendaya was mesmorisingevery cast member was perfectly cast
Nov 6 2021,positive,this modern day dune was very thing i hoped for best cinematography of 2021 with the best acting and directing of all year hands down top sci fi movie yet
Nov 6 2021,positive,visually awesome movie i couldnt blink nice photograph nice plans and sublime performance from the actors cant wait for the second part
Nov 6 2021,positive,tightly written powerfully directed and incredibly cast dune is a visual masterpiece that showcases and draws viewers into a world that is new to many anchored by the unflinching performance of timothee chalamet
Nov 6 2021,positive,wonderful chapter waiting for the next movie
Nov 6 2021,positive,absolute must see incredible amazing film
Nov 6 2021,positive,loved this adaptation  watched all of the older dune adaptations in expectation of watching this newest launch of dune and it was a great mix sure it kept some key characters for part 2 but that was to be expected so we could get more invested and have something astounding to look forward to thank you so much i have watched it in the theater and at homemuch better on the big screen with the surround sound highly recommended
Nov 6 2021,positive,one of the best scifi movies i have seen recently all the best to team for part 2
Nov 6 2021,positive,this film is something else in the very best way id describe it as perfectly balanced  a slowish build that immerses you and engages you from minute 1 with the intrigues of the story and for a story with so much lore and technical detail the film does a remarkably good job of getting that info to the viewer in simple and exciting ways obviously the visuals and audio esp the score are totally gorgeous the performances are excellent and the design work is that perfect blend of futuristic but not annoyingly futuristic ie no fluidlike nanotech no flashy overdesigned hologram interfaces ect     the one thing i would recommend tho is to take a hot sec and get a bit of background info about dune lore yourself before seeing the film  the film packs in a lot of fun cool stuff and it cant explain it all without ruining pacing and storytelling just watch a video or 2 explaining spice the spacing guild the bene gesserit etc   crash course on dune whatever  i knew precisely 0 about dune lore but i was excited about the film so i watched said videos and i was able to appreciate the films story without distractedly wondering why those guys in the background have helmets full of orange gas on their heads or why everyone uses swords to fight instead of futuristic machine guns
Nov 6 2021,positive,as good as a movie adaptation could have been without being 4 hours long i truly felt like i was seeing the book come to life i just hope we get to see an uncut version one day 
Nov 6 2021,positive,a visual masterpiece this movie is a true experience of what film is all about easily on my top 5 favorite movies of all time cant wait for the sequels
Nov 6 2021,positive,beautiful awe inspiring one of the greatest films ive ever seen and the best book to movie adaption ive watched where ive read the source material you can clearly see how this was deeply a project of passion for denis villeneuve
Nov 6 2021,positive,amazing visuals great acting and very accurate to the novel
Nov 6 2021,positive,fantastic storytelling drew you in without making you feel like an outsider if you hadnt read the book loved that the violence was not over the top while still feeling action packed and that the language was clean i wouldve turned around and watched it again the same night   only critique is the whispering was somewhat unintelligible over the music which was perfect music just loud in the theater it made me wish we had subtitles
Nov 6 2021,positive,i will probably need to see it again it was hard to make all the connections until towards the end looking forward to chapter 2  the creativity was amazing  i found it hard to hearunderstand what was being said at times but i find that a problem at the theater or at home on tv in general
Nov 6 2021,positive,dune is not your typical sify action movie is not star trek is not starwars and is defenetly not marvel i was surprised and exited to see the dune will trilogy  because is soo big you cant put everything in one movie i have watched the first dune and i have to say low passed film  can show more about the characters and their development something that dune has done very well it also show the corrupted political system of of arrakis  dune without a doubt is a glimpse of how movies uset to look like 30 years ago  but with a better structure on the timeline
Nov 6 2021,positive,the movies i consider as my favourites and rate as classics have in the vast majority of instances taken time and multiple viewings to grow on me and be recognised for the top quality works of art that they are not so in the case of dune 2021 denis villeneuve has made a true visually awe inspiring masterpiece which is perfectly cast acted directed paced edited and i could go on listing its perfections just read the end credits for what in my opinion is a list of talented people working at the very top of their repertoire the first movie i have seen that i would consider instant classic
Nov 6 2021,positive,wow just wow this movie is so well done so dark so moving and beautiful it makes the previous attempt laughable
Nov 6 2021,positive,awesome film loved it
Nov 6 2021,negative,swords and spears this is supposed to be science fiction  not a fantasy epic   dune takes place 8000 years in the future and yet humans are governing with medieval states worse yet in spite of all sorts of highly sophisticated very effective and extremely deadly weaponry they fight handtohand with swords and spears stupid if you like mindless action films by all means see it if youre looking for an engaging and smart scifi dune is not for you
Nov 6 2021,positive,this is the dune herberts fans have been waiting for
Nov 6 2021,positive,very well doneacting cinematographykeeps you engaged
Nov 6 2021,positive,it moved very slowly i liked the 1980s version better
Nov 6 2021,positive,this is the best movie i have seen in 3 years the graphics costumes acting all of it can hardly wait for part 2 i grew up with the original movie and have read the book loved it
Nov 6 2021,positive,this was an amazingly well done it was visually stunning with a different visual style than most movies i got a strong manga feel  books not cartoons  but done really really well the sets costumes and cinematography were absolutely stunning the cast was brilliant it wasnt just a bunch of big names to bring in audiences the acting was truly immersive    my only hope is that it does as well at the box office as it is a slower more cerebral narrative style of movie that is different from the space shootemups we see more of in recent years not that shootemups arent fun but this is equally engaging for different reasons i cant wait for part two
Nov 6 2021,positive,excellent visuals pace of the movie well written and acted 
Nov 6 2021,positive,what fantastic movie this is need the second part asap
Nov 6 2021,positive,absolutely beautiful film total visual delight with amazing sets and costumes incredible world building with a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack however much of the allstar cast was underutilized and the performances felt a bit emotionless i just had to accept their motivations without totally understanding them i didnt know what paul was supposed to be feeling as he reacted to the events around him and why did the fremen and harkonnen dislike one another i also had no idea it was a part 1 out of 2 so it felt incomplete as its own film granted this is a notoriously difficult book to turn into a film but villanueva created the best offering yet and is definitely worth seeing
Nov 6 2021,negative,some scenes dont make sense sometimes its hard to hear the audio the scenery and music was beautiful
Nov 6 2021,positive,why is it directors cant seem to find the right balance between sound and dialogue thats my biggest gripe with dune it was impossible to hear what paul and his mother were saying to each other in too many of interior scenes at the beginning of the movie  the same can be said of some scenes throughout contrasted by music and sound effects that were so loud it was annoying
Nov 6 2021,positive,this is a film that needs to be seen on the big screen the size and scope just does not do it justice on a tv   the film itself is very slow so dont expect a fast action film the cast were extremely good cant fault any of it the ships again awesome cgi work so mixed changes from the books but overall they are items you can live with i cant wait for part 2 if we are lucky they might do a part 2 and 3 back to back
Nov 6 2021,positive,a gorgeous historical film without words the actors acting is good and the plot is a bit long and boring but mostly i liked everything
Nov 6 2021,positive,it was everything i wanted a return to arrakis to be  amazing acting fantastic visuals and an incredible soundtrack  cant wait for part 2
Nov 6 2021,positive,i am not a dune fan and i didnt read the books i didnt watch frank herberts dune but ive enjoyed this movie i liked the cinematography and the visuals oscar isaac was great
Nov 6 2021,positive,excellent well paced movie that doesnt feel as long as it is  acting is brilliant as is the telling of the story and the world production sound and visual it plays within  my only gripe is we need to wait for the next part
Nov 6 2021,positive,fascinating grandiose breathtaking its a true masterpiece
Nov 6 2021,positive,visual effects aside the story didnt differ that much from the way david lynchs 1984 version was told in some cases the dialogue was almost verbatim personally i found the new dune easier to follow and less convoluted than lynchs version the original score was solid and the acting was so so i think oscar isaac has water downed his name somewhat by seemingly taking every role hes been offered lately i didnt really compare the new dune to the old dune as much as i did to blade runner 2049 which is my favorite denis villeneuve film obviously the contrast being that dune is a retelling versus br 2049 a continuation of ridley scotts blade runner again with both dune and br 2049 i call into question some of the casting choices that were made some were spot on and others missed the mark no pun intended visualscinematography writingstoryline casting and score are what makes or breaks a film for me i think dune had most of the components to be a home run but it ultimately fell short of the warning track
Nov 6 2021,positive,directing perfect  casting is well done every character feels real and alive  a really good adaptaion denis villeneuve created a masterpiece
Nov 6 2021,positive,didnt realize how long the movie was
Nov 6 2021,positive,a sciencefiction epic that is glorious to behold both spice and sandworm alike    canadian director denis villeneuves scifi epic adventure dune 2021 provides stunning fantasy vistas thought provoking political intrigue personable human drama of ascension and fate and exciting combat ive never seen a film quite like dune villeneuve blows every star wars and star trek film out of the water with his epic grandeur of sensational scope while keeping you involved in dunes complex lore villeneuve proves he is a formidable auteur as he successfully adapts author frank herberts 1965 novel dune for the silver screen in majestic fashion as someone who never read herberts dune book i was not confused by dunes enigmatic scifi world dune is easily the best made and most enthralling picture of 2021 thus far ill gladly watch the sequel as im entertained by this film while enticed for whatever comes next    timothée chalamet is compelling as the curious and maturing hero of dune named paul atreides chalamets subtle acting style lets you feel pauls every expression of pain doubt resilience respect pride humor and courage he bears a seriousness in his regal manner as well as a quietly contemplative humanity so that paul is simultaneously esoteric in his royal position and endearing in his humanistic charm chalamet truly is the greatest actor of his generation    rebecca ferguson steals every scene as the mysterious alluring fierce and caring lady jessica ferguson displays lady jessicas steadfast devotion to her son paul atreides as well as her enigmatic convictions for doing so with spiritual voice magic and brutal hand to hand violence ferguson is so lovely charismatic and sensitive against villeneuves fabulous backdrops she portrays lady jessica with a manic fervor as well as a poignant resolve and regal grace    oscar isaac is commanding as duke leto atreides with his stern manner but also feels tenderly paternal in his father and son scenes with chalamets paul atreides zendaya gets to shine as chani in her brief scenes with chalamet but is enchanting in pauls visions of the future im sure shell have a bigger role in dune part two jason momoa is entertaining and cool to watch joke and murder as the charismatic duncan idaho stellan skarsgård is fearsome with his eerie gravitas as the disgusting baron vladimir harkonnen he revels in his fat suit and oil    stephen mckinley henderson is kind and intelligent as thufir hawat josh brolin is tough and intimidating as the no nonsense gurney hallack javier bardem is striking and captivating as the freman leader stilgar sharon duncanbrewster is fascinating as dr liet kynes chang chen says much with a few lines and intense body language as dr wellington yueh dave bautista is scary and menacing as glossu rabban david dastmalchian is fun and interesting as the meekly voiced piter de vries charlotte rampling is mysterious and disturbing as the space witch character reverend mother gaius helen mohiam babs olusanmokun is terrifying and intense as jamis who challenges chalamets paul atreides to a duel to the death lastly benjamin clémentine cameos as the neat space envoy herald of the change    villeneuves direction is impressive as he focuses on attaining striking visuals alongside intricate scifi concepts of new technology and perilous space diplomacy dune author frank herberts story is as much a coming of age drama as it is a political drama about young paul atreides becoming a duke worthy of his family name fathers pride and mothers wisdom powers and grace herberts ideas also cross into warfare capitalism supply chains and how people and culture affect future diplomacy as much as the spice being mined from planetary deserts    screenplay writers for dune eric roth denis villeneuve and jon spaihts keep the story grounded with emotional characters and relatable human ideas i am still thinking about their themes of imperialism and conquests royaltys transitions of power family fatherhood motherhood romance maturity bravery and intelligence overcoming treachery dune is very intricate in its worlds fantasy lore but villeneuve helps you understand all the difficult names and strange magical concepts a scene at a time with his patient and entrancing direction    for a mammoth sized 155 minutes dune is made palatable through joe walkers tasteful editing that keeps the plot moving at a brisk pace his sharp cuts from conversations about destiny and serfdom to villeneuves visceral combat battles and harrowing sandworm encounters is inspired what else can be said about cinematographer greig frasers breathtaking ultra wide shots that make you believe in uncharted planets every panning shot of vast oceans of water to endless seas of sand and spice are magnificent to behold in theaters his intimate closeups feel as thoughtful and emotionally in tune with herberts characters as villeneuves stellar direction    patrice vermettes production design captures impoverished desert homes on planet arrakis as well as lavish regal halls for planet caladan karl probert tibor lázár tom brown bence erdelyi david doran sam hudecki gergely rieger and borbála debreczenis art direction makes these space worlds unique extraordinarily beautiful yet familiar enough to appear relatable richard roberts and zsuzsanna sipos minimalist set decoration keeps to villeneuves sparse style while adorning rooms with peculiar scifi gadgets and furnishings to keep you looking on in awe    dunes visual effects are phenomenally realistic and yet a world away in scale and imagination cgi artists michael lemon maricel pagulayan paul lambert brian connor tristan myles lorna barnshaw dan finnegan alvaro garcia frédéric gaudin hamid shahsavari ryan wing and shailesh chibire outdid themselves with dunes enormous sandworms shield armor missile launches ship landings and helicopter takeoffs dune is the best looking film of 2021 for sure    composer hans zimmer delivers an ethereal score of haunting melodies and pulsing bursts that will deafen you i appreciate how diverse zimmers music sounds with music from all over the world throughout dune with his versatile scoring blasting away i do think the sound mixing is too blasting as my only complaint about dune with blaring ship landings and quieter speaking volumes overall i was enchanted by dunes sound design sound effects artists mark a mangini ron bartlett theo green lee gilmore doug hemphill bob kellough and dani connor wild create startling explosions throbbing sandworm ripples piercing screams echoing inner voices and eccentric scifi noises for all the technology herein    i loved dunes cool costumes from designers jacqueline west bob morgan stacy horn and lilla vasvári from pauls black coats and armor to lady jessicas flowing gowns i believe rebecca fergusons ornate ceremonial gold dress may be cinemas most expensive costume in any film to date makeup artists donald mowat jutta russell daniel mcgraw judit farkasarful and kata huszár keep house atreides and house harronnen ghostly pale while the freman characters are all warmer browns and tan in color for distinct looks in dune    in all i highly recommend you see denis villeneuves dune in movie theaters if you can as it is an unforgettable experience of finely tuned craftsmanship and deft acting prowess from a wonderful ensemble cast
Nov 6 2021,positive,this adaptation doesnt necessarily introduce elements that werent already present in previous versions but rather refines those elements to near perfection masterpiece
Nov 6 2021,positive,great movie see it at the theaters if you can i saw it in dolby theater so good timothy and oscar are supurb
Nov 6 2021,positive,it needs to always have subtitles
Nov 6 2021,positive,loved the images and the depiction of one of my favorite books
Nov 6 2021,positive,the only reason i did not give 5 is that during the movie many a times the music build up would be too high and then nothing happens like why dude
Nov 6 2021,negative,it was a horrible movie you spent half the movie squinting instead of watching it because it kept flipping back and forth between extreme white and dark there should have been a seizure warning at the beginning of it there was a lot of explanation on things that didnt need explaining and none on some of the most confusing parts the future seeing was inconsistent and arrived at random times and the music or lack there of in certain parts wasnt great and didnt evoke any feelings compliment the scenes i honestly think it had so many good reviews because of the actors in it not because its a good movie because it isnt
Nov 6 2021,positive,denis villeneuve is very talented everything felt realistic with amazing cgi great acting and interesting twists my only qualm was that the pacing was a bit slow hopefully they build on the characters in the second film because they focused a lot more on the plot for this one
Nov 6 2021,positive,good storyline  action sequences some really bright acting spots   a bit over the top with nondescript ambient noise mixed wdramatic music  its fatiguing to have musicnoise climbing to crescendo over  over
Nov 6 2021,positive,this was a great film im glad theres a part one and part two as it allowed this first film to spent time world building and properly introducing us to characters the story didnt feel rushed and im excited to see what the sequel will do now that introductions are out of the way the cinematography was great
Nov 6 2021,positive,dune could be described in just one word  epic the scenery the costumes the soundtrack the actors  one thing better than the other its just such a spectacle to watch yes it is slow  and somehow i wasnt familiar with the idea that this is just the part one so when i felt like the movie just started it ended cut in half that came a bit unexpected but still i enjoyed that and as a bookworm i definitely value the tendency to take it detail by detail
Nov 6 2021,positive,finally someone has put the incredible masterpiece of frank herberts dune to film the right way thank you so much the 1980s attempt wasnt terrible compared to some movies ive seen but it was nothing compared to what dune was supposed to be i would almost suggest that you really should if you havent read the book dune yet but the movie does an excellent job of making the book come to life dune is most definitely going to be a series of films as they only covered the first half of the first book in the movie but i am ecstatic to see what else is coming as i have already read the entire book series i hope they continue to make the following movies as excellent as the first movie was
Nov 6 2021,positive,2 and a half hours of pure entertainment never a boring moment will be waiting to see part 2
Nov 6 2021,negative,its a long story that doesnt finish i wont pay to see part 2
Nov 6 2021,negative,ive never walked out of a movie in my life until today this was soooo boring dont waste your timemoney
Nov 6 2021,positive,this is what i imagined when i read the book hands down this is the definitive dune adaptation weve all been waiting for
Nov 6 2021,negative,it was very hard to follow the non existent storyline  best part was the end of the movie
Nov 6 2021,positive,show is visually stunning acting is good story is still out there nerds are loving it im more like
Nov 6 2021,negative,the most exciting part of this movie was the end credits couldnt wait for the movie to end visually stunning movie but if youre not invested in the lore of dune like i wasnt you will not enjoy this movie
Nov 6 2021,positive,visually stunning a bit confusing especially having never read the book the whole movie almost felt like a trailer or buildup for the next movie still intriguing and entertaining
Nov 6 2021,positive,follows the original
Nov 6 2021,positive,i went into this movie knowing nothing about it my friend tried to sum it up for me but it was to complicated the only reason i knew this movie was going to be good was because of the man composing the score for the movie hans zimmer  i know call me weird but he composes for really big movies i went into this movie not knowing a thing and walked out understanding the entire thing this movie is awesome i cannot wait for part 2
Nov 6 2021,positive,incredible movie that did an excellent job of staying true to the original authors intent
Nov 6 2021,positive,the best movie ive seen this year visually ambitious would be an understatement the movie is jawdroppingly epic bring on part 2
Nov 6 2021,negative,one of the worst screen plays ever the dialog is terrible 
Nov 6 2021,positive,my brother who is not a big scifi fan and has not read the book maybe ten times like i have likes the lynch version better because he thinks the characters are spookier i mostly agree with him too bad this film does not make vladimir harkonnen a murdering pedophile like he is in the book this is in the lynch version and it makes the antagonist much more repellent but in todays world that kind of thing might be too much strangely and they do not feature the word jihad like they do in the the book a central building block of the tension in herberts world because of course that would be way too much infuriatingly the spectacle and loyalty to the book in this movie are impressive but i must agree with quite a few reviewers who say its a little cold not much reason to care about whats going on i also have to agree that this is a work that might be unadaptable some of the direct quotes are clunky they dont translate well impressive cinematic achievement and i love seeing my beloved characters but the book is light years better always will be i was telling my brother what they were saying with the litany against fear and shaihulud and whatnot there is a disconnect between the iconic seminal scifi novel of all times writing and translating it to the screen i applaud the effort its seriously entertaining and super well produced shot and acted but i dont think the book can ever be done right doesnt mean im not chomping at the bit to see part 2
Nov 6 2021,negative,i was excited because of the cast and the trailers  but this was by far the most boring movie ive ever seen i started playing retro bowl 30 minutes in and i was excited to leave the theater after what felt like an eternity
Nov 6 2021,positive,fantastic effects  pretty faithful visavis the book  sound track was hard to hear but wonderful music
Nov 6 2021,neutral,slow boring didnt tell the story well
Nov 6 2021,positive,just good enough innecesarily slow at times way to many slow motion scenes dreams and visions will give part ii a chance
Nov 6 2021,negative,visually stunning but somehow has a 20 minute longer runtime than the lynch version and explains less while only having to cover half the material
Nov 6 2021,positive,absolutely incredible cast cinematography and macbethesque plot cant wait for the next one
Nov 6 2021,positive,loved it cant wait for the sequel  it looked good it sounded good i liked the world the characters and the story
Nov 6 2021,positive,absolutely one of the best movies of the year
Nov 6 2021,positive,pro  great special effects good acting     cons  too long hard to follow the plot
Nov 6 2021,positive,we enjoyed the storyline and look forward to part 2
Nov 6 2021,positive,absolutely beautiful  amazing cinematography work with chills head to toe flowing more times than you could count  has not been a movie with this kind of tone in a long time  takes a break from your normal movie nowadays with action behind every corner  this is a story driven movie with meaning in every single scene  built for a very mature audience with younger audience members will most likely find it sluggish and boring  overall an amazing movie and cant wait to see whats to come with the series
Nov 6 2021,positive,the scope the ambition and the overall courage to create is on full display in dune be prepared for roughly 30 minutes of exposition after that it takes off
Nov 6 2021,positive,loved the whole movie from start to finish never lost interest
Nov 6 2021,positive,i really enjoyed this movie it was shot beautifully and had just enough to keep me interested the whole time
Nov 6 2021,negative,hated hated hated it
Nov 6 2021,positive,went to movie with my 18 year old i read dune as a teenager and he has never read the book i enjoyed the movie but he was thoroughly confused i gave him some intel during the movie which helped more prologue and backstory is needed for those not familiar with the novel
Nov 6 2021,positive,i loved watching dune the look and feel of the movie is hypnotic  the visual style is incredible  i saw it for free on hbo max and then paid to go see it in the theater where it was even better  the storytelling is top notch and the production design is amazing
Nov 6 2021,positive,this is the adaptation i have been waiting for as jackson did for the fellowship of the ring so villeneuve has done for the 1st half of dune i saw the characters i have long loved come to life as opposed to the parodies they became in lynchs movie and it was beautifully shot as were villeneuves other movies i cannot wait for part ii and i hope dune messiah
Nov 6 2021,positive,gorgeous film great acting  really looking forward to part 2
Nov 6 2021,positive,best movie of the year
Nov 6 2021,positive,a true rendition of the book and visually stunning
Nov 6 2021,positive,return of the jedi meets waterworld
Nov 6 2021,positive,spectacular a feast for the eyes ears and mind
Nov 6 2021,positive,this movie should have been a series done
Nov 6 2021,positive,this is the best scifi film ive seen in years and my favorite film of 2021 an amazing adaptation of the book with a diverse cast and story that both are done well it allows the viewer to be immersed in an entirely new world with interesting characters and explore it together as their story unfolds you will feel like you are part of this film when watching it make sure to see it on imax
Nov 6 2021,positive,lots of action and good acting
Nov 6 2021,negative,visuals are fantastic story is slow and boring not worth a rewatch
Nov 6 2021,negative,bad soundtrack too slow it has a lot of potential but it is disappointing i got a headache for the soundtrack
Nov 6 2021,positive,i didnt know a whole lot about this except the 1984 version was not considered any good  and i wanted a big movie to be my first back in a theater after 20 months or so  im a timothee fan and enjoyed him rebecca ferguson and all  jason momoa was surprisingly good  amazing effects  particularly impressed with the hundreds of people who worked on this film glad its doing well at the boxoffice
Nov 6 2021,positive,dune as a whole was practically a religious experience almost every actor brought their agame zendaya sounded like she does on every other movie jason mamoa tried but barely reached beyond is normal talents the soundtrack is otherworldly and i am now obsessed with it the cinematography is outstanding i am going to watch this movie many times see it in theaters if at all possible the scale of the film requires it
Nov 6 2021,positive,a great movie from start to finish the scenery actor choices and music score were all impressive if you go to movies to be entertained and to escape reality for awhile youll enjoy this one looking forward to seeing the sequel
Nov 6 2021,neutral,enjoyable but very confusing and pretty slow
Nov 6 2021,positive,fantastic film overall director denis villeneuve captures the feel and mythos of the dune universe from frank herberts dune novel the acting was spot on and the cinematic experience is best seen at a movie theater i cant wait for part 2
Nov 6 2021,positive,when does the next one come out  never saw a worm  liked it more than my husband
Nov 6 2021,positive,going to watch it again on hbomax
Nov 6 2021,positive,best movie since the hobbit  a must see in cinema ill go see it a second time with my parents just because
Nov 6 2021,positive,the movie is incredible but a little confusing
Nov 6 2021,positive,dune excellent a star wars for adults cinematography sets location etc capture atmosphere of the book which can be difficult to do  its also tough to convey the complexities of the books world and plot without being too talky but the movie does fairly well at that acting generally very  good but too much of chalamet looking messiahlike
Nov 6 2021,positive,as a fan of the books i say this is an amazing adaptation denis villeneuve was definitely the right person for this the cast is also crazy good and does an astonishing job on bringing the characters to life i cant wait to see the part 2 if it continues what was done here thats a guaranteed 1010
Nov 6 2021,negative,at its core the book is a political thriller which doesnt come across in the movie  the movie is more epic scifi action whose allstar casts talents are wasted on paperthin characters  it is hard to care about any of them  the bene gesserit powers are largely unexplained as is the fremen culture religion prophesy and fierceness  without which there is no story  ultimately i think material this complex requires and deserves a multiseason series to do it justice ala game of thrones  those who havent read the book will be a bit confused and those who have will be disappointed
Nov 5 2021,positive,the only really issue i had with it is that it is a part one and part two isnt even made yet so i have to wait 2 years to see the second half
Nov 5 2021,positive,checks off all the boxes for what an epic should be great acting cinematography and pacing instantly fell in love with this film
Nov 5 2021,positive,stunning piece of work a must see on imax or the big screen
Nov 5 2021,positive,see this on the big screen asap
Nov 5 2021,positive,love this film  not an absolute depiction of the first half of the book but its a dang good adaptation on the story  love the small attention to details throughout the film  this movie is designed to make you think and not be rammed up the wazzzooo of cgi special effects even though theres plenty of it but used in proper context to depict the world that this story exists in    not going to give it a full 5star review i feel too much of this film was cut to reduce run time but was needed in the story for property context to the complexity of the world exists in    when i watched it for the first time i wasnt ready for the film to end i was hooked on the plot and story  such rarity can make runtime meaningless even though youre in the chair for 25 hours youll be wanting more    i cant wait for part 2
Nov 5 2021,negative,so dull and long dont know why is so well scored
Nov 5 2021,positive,will go down as one of the greatest movies of the decade if not of all time  an absolute love letter to the source material  meticulous and engrossing great acting stunning cinematography and sound a joy for the big screen
Nov 5 2021,positive,great cgi and first two acts however the slow pacing of the 3rd act and overall confusing nature for people who have not read the book make the movie quite boring
Nov 5 2021,neutral,not what i find entertaining
Nov 5 2021,positive,an absolute epic that did the source material proud i loved it and they did an excellent job of weaving the complex background story and mythology into the movie without heavy exposition im excited for part 2
Nov 5 2021,positive,a bland spiceless reimagining of frank herberts dune that i never dreamt being this much of a disappointment  dark and grim with flat uninteresting and somewhat cliche characters with a boring story devoid of any spiciness whatsoever  the only saving grace for this is that it might get better in part two and it should since all this film seemed to be doing was setting up the next movie  not a fun watch    originally 2 of 5 amended 11621  so i watched this the next day on hbomax less than a day after seeing it in the theater and i honestly liked it a lot more  this was more surprising than how disappointed i was by my theater viewing because of all the people who insisted this was a mustsee for the movie theater myself included  the difference could be technical its still dark and brooding but the room i viewed it in at home was a bit brighter than the theater which makes the screen seem brighter and the sound somehow seemed better which is odd because my sound system is not great  maybe its because i didnt like the audience i was with and how they were seeing it in contrast to how i normally see films  maybe its all because its my second time seeing it but it still shouldnt take two viewings if its good at least not for me
Nov 5 2021,positive,it is deep and lots to take in but just let yourself get immersed in this world and enjoy itit is amazing
Nov 5 2021,positive,an interesting first part that feels a little to much like a first part yet the world building and the cinematography makes this movie a joyride and makes you excited about whats to come
Nov 5 2021,negative,seemed like a selfindulgence for the cinematographers so boring and tedious to watch i dont even care enough to want to wait for the next installment 
Nov 5 2021,positive,it was a beautiful movie great score and soundtrack  the story was clear  the villians thank you were terrifying  i saw it on the big scene and then twice at home  i really appreciated the subtitles at home to understand it better  my only critism was dave bautista  typically i love him but he over acted the scenes that he was in  jason momoa was fantastic as well as timothee chalamet  the casting of rebecca ferguson was an odd choose because she doesnt look like she could be his mother  they could pass as siblings but her performance was great  so yeah 55 for me
Nov 5 2021,positive,this movie succeeds on so many levels the art direction cinematography music acting and script were all top notch by far the best adaptation of frank herberts masterpiece
Nov 5 2021,positive,depending on how the second part concludes this could be one of the best scifi movies of all time
Nov 5 2021,positive,a rare movie that is better each time you see it
Nov 5 2021,positive,better than i expected this is the best representation of the authors vision i have seen to date
Nov 5 2021,positive,i liked the movie but was impatient that theres a part 2 however its worth the wait i suppose
Nov 5 2021,positive,great movie go watch it
Nov 5 2021,positive,fantastic visuals mood and pacing the acting couldnt be better and the director makes every effort to not violate the book it has to leave a fair amount out but none of it is essential and what is there captures the story beautifully
Nov 5 2021,positive,perfect hard book and very good movie
Nov 5 2021,positive,beautiful  well paced    i think it on par with the lynch version in terms of enjoyment
Nov 5 2021,positive,good movie with great cinematography even though the movie itself is quite large with a fantastic cast but somehow it felt incomplete
Nov 5 2021,positive,visuals story and acting were fantastic long movie but well worth it
Nov 5 2021,positive,it was phenomenal a 5  movie i highly recommend it  the music cinematography the creativity and performance i was left speechless at the end an absolute delight for the eyes and ears one of the best films ive seen in a very long time    a side note its a mythological futuristic scifi film
Nov 5 2021,positive,dune 2021 is a must see theater experience and proves that movie theaterhome streaming is a possible combination dune is a slow burning scifi adventure with outstanding vfx and cinematography along with an outstanding hanz zimmer score dune takes its time to establish excellent world building and character development that is a must see on the big screen
Nov 5 2021,positive,was expecting more of an ending than a lead into the next movie
Nov 5 2021,positive,the anticipation was true it is as good as expected performances are great visuals are outstanding can wait for the  sequel
Nov 5 2021,positive,truely great acting but bad storyline a movie with a dissapointing ending
Nov 5 2021,negative,im very disappointed by this movie
Nov 5 2021,positive,best movie of the year already seen it 3 times this movie deserves to be seen on the big screen
Nov 5 2021,positive,im a fan of the original novels and i think this was by and large a fantastic adaptation except for a few things am looking forward to the sequels    if youre watching it in malaysia the malay subtitles are epic because they fully lean into the islamic elements that frank herbert appropriated for the original novel i saw an essay by haris durrani complaining that this had been diluteddumbed down for the us audience but i really didnt notice because the bm subs were great    language does seems to be one of the big hurdles to creating a fully immersive other world here even though they tried for example paul can supposedly speak mandarin but 5 seconds later pronounces dr yuehs name the way a monolingual white anglophone american would and chani zendaya is lietkynes daughter and half fremen so she should either have a british accent like lietkynes sharon duncanbrewster andor a fremen accent instead she also has a generic north american accent just be consistent people maybe to us americans they dont notice but to everybody else its a jarring reminder that this is hollywood and it pokes a hole in the 4th wall of that otherwise meticulously constructed and gorgeous world
Nov 5 2021,positive,i reserve judgement as i measure dune against the john harrison directed version which wi also have the 3 disc set which was much much better than the 80s theatrical version lets see part 2  3 before a true judgement is rendered
Nov 5 2021,positive,enjoyable and beautiful  felt slow at times but the majestically beautiful shots made up for that
Nov 5 2021,positive,its a great take from the books denis villeneuve gave us a visual masterpiece
Nov 5 2021,positive,the photography was perfect for the story  i read the book when i was a teenager  55 years ago  and it brought it all back to me great acting
Nov 5 2021,positive,now this is what cinematic film making is all about  this is a moving masterpiece of cinematic framing picture composition attention to detail visual nuance and one of the most incredible sound designs to date  epic dark and tremendous    anyone that gave this less than 5 stars didnt see this at the theatre  this movie is what big screens and sound was made for this is a film based on scale  the drama the vast nature of the universe is extremely well thought out and that is crystal clear as you watch  one of the most immersive film experiences of the last 10 years  i would go as far as to say that it made me feel like i was going to the movies when i was a kid  its unique and feels like incredible directing
Nov 5 2021,positive,good start source material helps
Nov 5 2021,positive,satisfyingly slow happy this is not crammed into one movie
Nov 5 2021,positive,absolutely fantastic overall this film was a beautiful piece of art each aspect of it blended together to tell a fascinating story my personal favorite of these aspects include the amazing writing cinematography and acting this is definitely a must see
Nov 5 2021,positive,this movie is without a doubt the best movie i have ever seen on the big picture dennis villeneuve manage to create one of the most beautiful movies i have ever seen the adaptation of the frank herbert novel is done perfectly the cast knock this one out of the park i recommend to view this movie on the biggest screen possibly and im looking forward to the future of this franchise
Nov 5 2021,positive,i really liked this first part of dune i can only imagine what they have in store for the second i never saw the 1984 version but after seeing this i will have to give it a try cinemotography was 55 and the score was amazing as well
Nov 5 2021,negative,the whole movie is very slow and the trailer was much better than the movie as a final product
Nov 5 2021,positive,dense and complex yet intriguing and beautiful incredible acting and set pieces throughout visual effects on another level bring on part 2
Nov 5 2021,positive,this movie is a mustsee not on a laptop or a tv but the biggest screen possible every piece of this film from the story to the direction from the cinematography to the visual effects are amazing
Nov 5 2021,positive,amazing world building and acting cgi blends in very natural and scenery and costume design is on point cant wait for part 2
Nov 5 2021,negative,awfully boring and confusing 25 hours of torture 
Nov 5 2021,positive,this is a very faithful adaption of a beloved scifi novel while i will say that it will be more enjoyable for book fans than nonbook fans objectively it is quite an enjoyable film also there is nothing wrong with having this film make people want to read the books for answers because yay to more people reading
Nov 5 2021,positive,dune is a great movie and one of the best that have been released in this 2021 visually it is incredible showing us the immensity of the planets established and introduces the basis for future sequels where it is clear how this incredible world works good performances from all the cast especially thimothée chalamet and rebecca ferguson plus a great soundtrack that accompanies well the moments highly recommended to see it in theaters
Nov 5 2021,positive,great movie  sound track and action were awesome
Nov 5 2021,positive,this version is better than the 84 david lynch version  i believe it was the right decision to do the story in two films  dune is an exposition and detail dense story  splitting the story over two films provides much better pacing and time to fill in some of the details  that said the film still drops ignores or glossesover details from the novel explaining mentats for example  but unlike the 84 film these omissions do not hurt the film and in fact help tell the story in this medium    i made an effort to see this film in the theater instead of on hbomax  the film benefited from being seen on the big screen with a nice atmos system in the auditorium if your only theater option is a shoebox multiplex then save your money and watch it on hbo  however if you have the ability to see it in a nice imax or dolby cinema then your viewing experience will be much better than streaming
Nov 5 2021,positive,amazing screenplay visuals soundtrack and costumes world feels so real
Nov 5 2021,negative,the most boring movie ive seen in a long time fails to deliver even a single thrill over its entire run time a bland movie with wasted talent  money
Nov 5 2021,positive,popcorn  no lines great movie
Nov 5 2021,positive,very well executed and intriguing version of dune 
Nov 5 2021,positive,𝘋𝘶𝘯𝘦 has all the elements to make a mark in cinema history coming from a very popular story casting many highly talented actors breathtaking effects and scenes and accompanied by the music of on the the best film composers of all time yet it falls short 𝘋𝘶𝘯𝘦 caters too closely to fans of the story and leaving people like me who arent big readers confused and disappointed timothée chalamet deserves at the very least an oscar nomination for his performance and in terms of everything but the story 𝘋𝘶𝘯𝘦 is the masterpiece we expected if hans zimmer is ever partnered with visuals like that you can always expect a feast for the eyes and ears which is exactly what we got
Nov 5 2021,positive,wasnt sure of everything that was going on and distracted by things like why are they using swords but the world and imagery were absorbing
Nov 5 2021,positive,top 15 movie all time for me loved it start to finish epic
Nov 5 2021,positive,slow pace but interesting story and setup for sequels
Nov 5 2021,positive,incredible scope and masterful directing this is a movie you wanna live in over and over again it will be a great double feature with br 2049 for scifi fans
Nov 5 2021,negative,boring and hard to understand the first dune movie was also not easy to understand but much better save your money dont go a sequel will be probable not any better  main actor was clearly miscast read the book first
Nov 5 2021,positive,somewhat disappointed story dragged between the iconic action and set pieces impressed with the desert but where were the caves liked liet kynes as a female loved jameis before he had to die hope part 2 is better
Nov 5 2021,positive,dune is a visually and aurally stunning movie deniss directing paired extremely well with the amazing world of dune the movie also did a great job portraying the main characters although i would have liked to see more development of other characters it is important to acknowledge that the world of dune makes it extremely hard to do so with so many moving pieces denis did a great job introducing us to the complicated political landscape of space in the future world building takes center stage in this adaptation with a deliberately slow pace that never failed to capture my attention rebecca fergusons performance definitely shined closely followed by timothée chalamets intentionally emotionless portrayal of paul i think this movie will age extremely well especially if the sequel takes advantage of all the set up in this movie
Nov 5 2021,positive,cinematic masterpiece one of the greatest adaptions of a novel ever cant wit for part two nuff said
Nov 5 2021,positive,best scifi movie of our generation period
Nov 5 2021,positive,long movie but the it paid off looking fwd to the second one
Nov 5 2021,positive,acting was very good  animation was very good  i thought the darkness of the scenes was excessive and the purpose was not clear  the dialogue was low volume and difficult to hear while the soundtrack was loud in comparison  overall it is superior to the dune movie filmed in the 1980s
Nov 5 2021,positive,fresh for sure   while not cinematic storytelling genius this rendering of the frank herbert tale does not disappoint the harkonnen villains are terrifying and effective played by stellan skarsgaard and your favourite meatball dave bautista from guardians of the galaxy every epic tale of this sort needs strong villains skarsgaard is cold heartless and perfect in this role   the actor playing paul chalamet is such a skinny skeleton of a dude its takes a classic suspension of disbelief to accept him as a formidable fighter and upandcoming messiah in an adventure movie in movies of this sort that is expected and he passes it off relatively well in addition i am always disappointed that such and engaging tale is cut short by a two part movie and doubly so when i am not prepared for it by any of the lead up media or trailers however in hindsight i appreciate the dedication of the thorough telling of the herbert tale which requires a longer filming i intentionally avoid all advance reviews and media coverage due to the inevitable spoilers and preconceived and frankly unwanted opinions name dropping and conjecture
Nov 5 2021,positive,third best work of villeneuve behind only of sicario and incendies
Nov 5 2021,positive,i have never read frank herberts dune novel but i did see the original theatrical version back theatre back in 1984 that was an interesting but somewhat perplexing  experience i checked out denis villeneuves a director i admire greatly version in the glory of imax wow what an incredible experience the film is part 1 mentioned as such in the opening credits so it doesnt try to cram the complex story into one film like the 1984 version the story was relatively easy to understand and i really enjoyed it acting very good direction excellent cinematography stunning cgi stunning sound stunning i only have two quibbles 1 with trailers the film runs 2 hrs 45 minutes  it flew by for me but avoid those large drinks and time your pee breaks accordingly and 2 sometimes the soundtrack made the dialogue difficult to hear this may be a miscalibrated imax problem in my theatre or something overall a big wow which i uttered a few times during the film cant wait for part two
Nov 5 2021,positive,i like movies of this genre but to me dune was a bit boring i like that zendaya and timothee chalamet are in dune the atmosphere of that world was shown amazing
Nov 5 2021,positive,i need to give it a second watch to give a full review but it was hard to follow at some parts and i think it could benefit from subtitles
Nov 5 2021,positive,this was part 1 of probably multiple parts of a franchise that has the potential of being top tier quality cinema    after reviewing the trailer for this masterpiece i went in this movie not knowing anything about arrakis or spice or anything about dune lore i had heard that it inspired star wars the lord of the rings and game of thrones so my interest was peaked    i have always enjoyed villeneuves films they have a particular style to them that just works dune part one was that kind of film to me i was immersed in the gargantuan epic scale of the visuals as well as how the story progressed the flow just worked combined with hans zimmers appropriate soundtrack which was definitely in his element of music choice the music certainly set the correct tone for this masterpiece    the cast was beautiful and just right for the roles they were playing timothée chalamet stunned me with his powerful acting portraying the role of paul atreides zendaya does a marvelous job at not being zendaya and actually made me interested as to who chani was chani is barely in the film because this is only the first part and paul atreides finally meets her in the last few minutes of this film even though we see only glimpses of her through dreams she still left an impression at the end    jason mamoas duncan idaho was a fun charismatic and charming character which left an everlasting impression as well i actually felt emotionally attached to this character especially when he dies as sacrifice in order to aid paul and his mother lady jessica rebecca ferguson to escape the harkonnens i actually was seeing duncan idaho and not jason mamoa that is what it felt like    the rest of the cast was fantastic the emperor was really menacing and definitely sold me the notion that he must go bill skarsgard does an amazing job at this role simply scary and true to the lore i must add    seeing the scale of which the director filmed this mesmerized me as well as kept me engaged with the flow of the story i was absolutely gobsmacked by the sheer scale of the dune giant sandworm shaihulud it felt like i the viewer was actually there and it was truly a terrifying yet beautiful sight to behold    i am really glad i saw this movie in a cinema and not at home for this was definitely one of the best cinematic experiences to date cannot wait for dune part two go see this film in theatres you will not be disappointed    bring on dune part two
Nov 5 2021,positive,ive seen it twice and will go again to experience it on imax loved it
Nov 5 2021,negative,summary     dune is 25 hours of mom  son mumble about space politic in the deserts with random ads of zendayas perfume thrown in     first time in my life i watch a movie that tries to captivate the audience with just the good looks of its actors instead of good storytelling its so unbearable to watch i would just run out of the theater if i could at that time to instantly buy another movie ticket   its a confusing movie didnt explain itself properly but just goes with it anyways plus the scenery its all just deserts as far as the eye can see most of the time and whats with the mc daydreaming every 15 minutes even during intense moments so stupid      conclusion boring confusing and unbearable to watch
Nov 5 2021,positive,i finished the books about 3 months before the movie was announced so i was very hyped about it since the story is amazing i cant emphasize enough my expectations were very very high and i think that denis villenueve and the cast did an amazing amazing job even though some scenes from the book were not pictured in the movie for one reason or another it did not dissapoint just an amazing job by everyone  every time a new movie comes out the director says it needs to be watched in the theatre its not true in the 90 of the time but this oneyou really have to just for the sound it really immerses you into this world  to end this ill just say that this is quite possibly the best movie ive seen in the past 10 years a really really great job
Nov 5 2021,positive,visuals 55  story 55  cinematography 55  acting 55  action 55  world building 55  movie score 55  u cant non of us canshouldmust miss any chance to watch this masterpiece
Nov 5 2021,positive,really awesome movie my only problem is the way it ends
Nov 5 2021,positive,dune influenced 2 of my most favorite fictions  star wars and the wheel of time i bought a copy of the book from borders closing sale back in 2011 but it stayed unread for the past 10 years the movie was so awesome that it reignited my interest to read it 455 scales
Nov 5 2021,positive,easily one of the best scifi movies i have seen in my life the scale of the production design the soundtrack the acting are all toptier excited to see what part 2 brings
Nov 5 2021,positive,this movie is cool af
Nov 5 2021,positive,dont stone me i actually liked it better than the book
Nov 5 2021,positive,the movie looks great and the sound effects are amazing the set up is great for the second part
Nov 5 2021,positive,i really loved this moviewaiting for part 2
Nov 5 2021,positive,great adaptation and visual masterpiece
Nov 5 2021,positive,what an amazing movie when i left the movie theater i was so immersed in this film i had to reassemble myself that im back in reality amazing acting  great screen writing and the soundtrack oh my god the soundtrack is so beautiful this is hans zimmers best work a masterpiece
Nov 5 2021,positive,a fantastic movie with depth and resolve
Nov 5 2021,positive,this is a beautifully done movie the characters are rich and the story interesting and well told ive already seen it twice and will certainly see it again very much anticipating the next movie
Nov 5 2021,positive,perfect in every ways chalamet music images sounds
Nov 5 2021,positive,features of a good movie  1 i got out of the movie and i didnt regret seeing it  2 some scenes stay with you long after you see them   3 you remember the main character s   dune fits all of these criteria   4 you decide now that you definitely will see the sequel     butseeing it once is enough and  you dont leave the theater with emotion so strong it literally makes you laugh or put a smile on your facethis is how you know its not a great movie hence the 4 stars instead of 5
Nov 5 2021,positive,not since the mummy 1999 have i seen a movie so beautiful that takes place in the desert cant wait till part ii
Nov 5 2021,positive,same old same old but with better effects and more cinematic
Nov 5 2021,positive,this movie  from the visuals to the audio to the acting to the emotion  is everything i could have ever wanted
Nov 5 2021,positive,what a beautiful  sophisticated world denis adapted onto screen while others may have found it slow  exposition heavy i found myself listening to every piece of dialogue to find out more about the world of dune timothee chalamet did a remarkable job as paul atreides the special affect  sound for this film are on another level you can sense the scale of how large  epic this world is i was at the edge of my seat any time the sand worms appeared  thanks to the films ending cannot wait to see them more in part 2 as someone who didnt know much a dune going in i am hooked  ready for part 2
Nov 5 2021,positive,amazing revision of a classic i cant wait for part 2 
Nov 5 2021,negative,the slow progression of storytelling prevents the film from meeting the expectation action scene is not very good
Nov 5 2021,positive,true to the book and the original movie grander in scale and the changes from the original only clarified and amplified the story its an exciting and worthy remake and i cannot wait for the next installment
Nov 5 2021,positive,awesome visually great adaptation and well acted must see on big screen
Nov 5 2021,negative,boring watching paint dry on a wall would be more fun
Nov 5 2021,positive,insanely incredibly fantastic
Nov 5 2021,positive,it summarizes well the story of the book even though it isnt a perfect translation from the book to cinema it is still i think the best and most spectacular adaptation another one of denis villeneuves masterpieces incredible actors and magnificent decors scenery even the props are beautiful and well made very impressed cant wait for the second part
Nov 5 2021,positive,amazing slow movie but as a film watcherlover you gotta have patience you need to pay attention to everything every detail every line every emotion everything in a film has a meaning has something behind it it was an amazing movie great acting and a great intro to a storyline super excited for the sequel 
Nov 5 2021,positive,outstanding movie  followed the book very closely  great special effects  cant wait for number 2
Nov 5 2021,positive,special effects were excellent interesting make up  costuming convincing acting performances by a stellar cast a few sections that lacked momentum great score
Nov 5 2021,positive,uffff lo que se viene hermano 
Nov 5 2021,positive,once you see the start cannot take your eyes off the screen a few alterations from the original but most of the story line stays the same
Nov 5 2021,positive,great cinematography  interesting use of visions and foreshadowing dragged in the middle for me  i wish there was some resolution
Nov 5 2021,positive,although splitting the book into two parts hurts the film as the whole film feels like a setup to the conclusion you dont get still dune is an engrossing watch and excels in adapting heberts complex work with solid performances gorgeous cinematography and amazing action set pieces denis villeneuve once again proves why he is one of the best filmmakers working today
Nov 5 2021,positive,stunning some of the best time ive spent in a theater in a long while
Nov 5 2021,negative,zendaya queen the rest is just so boring sorry
Nov 5 2021,positive,great movie i personally wasnt a huge fan of some of the cinematography particularly the big wide landscape shots only because it got a little too big and i couldnt tell where my attention was supposed to go everything besides that was on point though strong work from the filmmakers
Nov 5 2021,positive,the photography and soundtrack of the movie take de cinema experience to another level
Nov 5 2021,negative,i only wish that david lynch had had the resources and permission to do a twopart movie in the way he had wanted using modern special effects    i mean perhaps the next movie will open with paul giving water to the dead but such a pivotal scene being admitted from a movie that had time and resources to add such finesse would have been nice yknow
Nov 5 2021,positive,beautiful imagery  the contrast between the pouring rain and sand was spectacular but with the amount of rain there should have been more green forests  im disappointed that the movie didnt finish the first book  seeing it in imax was worth it because i can feel the ornithopter on the feet
Nov 5 2021,positive,not familiar with the source material but my son and i absolutely loved this movie  and the sound mixingwow  you have to see it in a theater
Nov 5 2021,negative,false advertising there was no mention in any of the promotion that after seeing the movie you would only see part of the whole story very disappointing
Nov 5 2021,positive,didnt know anything about dune going in came out wanting read the books before the next part
Nov 5 2021,positive,as good as lord of the rings  looking forward to part ii
Nov 5 2021,positive,good not great felt hollow and perfunctory the characters sets and overall world building like all big budget movies it is beautiful to look at though i think it will be great once it is in context with the rest of the films if those films are allowed to expand on whats been laid out 
Nov 5 2021,positive,i was overwhelmed simply brilliant such a shame its only part 1
Nov 5 2021,positive,as someone who has not only seen the 1984 version movie and the both mini series but also read all six of the original books twice i can say that is nearly as perfect of an adaptation as i have ever seen dune is one of the most famous literary works of all time this movie was nearly flawless in both its retelling of the original story and scope of vision truly the only thing i could even say about it is that zendaya only exudes about 90 of the grittiness that i was expecting from her character but that might just be a oneoff or the tables could turn in the next installment not saying she gave a bad performance the whole movie was good furthermore all of these critics that say the directors are spinning their wheels over using special effects hyping too many characters or spending all the action in the beginning of the movie well they are all wrong and obviously never read the original book especially not twice every scene every character every big special effect is precisely where it should be if you are familiar with the story you should come away fulfilled if you are a new to the dune story viewer you should like it and there will be a lot you do not understand but you should still enjoy the movie quite a bit new viewers many want to watch the movie again watch some youtube videos explaining the plot or maybe both but this movie should at the very least entertain any fan of the science fiction genre unless you are a movie critic or expect every movie to follow the hero smashes the bad guy and marries the girl american standard
Nov 5 2021,positive,i saw the original years ago i like this one i couldnt stay to the end but i will be back next time
Nov 5 2021,positive,disappointing compared to the last movie and books while the cinematography and special effects are great the acting and dialogue are too hollow its like villeneuve tries to make every scene a work of art to stand on its own with nothing of depth behind it and the new cast has been too perfectly selected in political correct proportions im not eager for a sequel
Nov 5 2021,neutral,if you know nothing about this movie you are completely lost i reccomend reading a quick wiki page about dune   the cinematography is beautiful timothee does an excellent as the main lead and the rest of the cast very well chosen   to me it just felt completely slow the action scenes were super short and i found it so boring   at least with with the star wars franchise you get a summary with what to expect   the audience is thrown into a complete new world   watching this movie felt like you just walked into the middle of a conversation between 2 friends and you have no idea whats going and want to walk away   the last 30 minutes of the movie were good but i wasnt impressed   if youre a dune fan or like slow movies that talk a lot this one is for you
Nov 5 2021,negative,what a disaster maybe 1000 words of dialogue movie is comprised of battles and sand period not much of a plot i was seriously disappointed
Nov 5 2021,positive,on a technical level dune 2021 is an extraordinary achievement its obvious that director denis villeneuve plays in the top league i highly recommend to watch dune 2021 at your local cinema on a large screen on the other hand both story and tone  of dune have been used as a template for several other scifi and fantasy epics in the past decades     as a result the story feels a tad bit outdated to me if youve seen dune 1984 by david lynch then dont expect any big changes storywise and dont expect dune 2021 to do for scifi what lotr did for fantasy eg reinvent the genre    yet i still enjoyed it and im happy that warner took on the risk of producing such a marvelous piece of cinema    whether it was really necessary to split up the plot into two films we will know once part 2 comes out in 2023 but im hopeful that villeneuve bring the story to a satisfying conclusion
Nov 5 2021,negative,granted im an older scifi fan who has read frank huberts masterpieces  but this version of dune doesnt capture the sweeping drama and complex characteristics of paul muabdib and the dune universe  instead were given an androgynous brooding sort who is neither heroic or charismatic  how does such a character win the hearts and minds of the fremin people  hell this guy looks like hes about to cry every time someone speaks to him    ar any rate they lost me as a fan as soon as this new paul opened his mouth  i never expected this new production to cast a napoleon dynamite nerd type into the main characters role  not worth your time if you are a fan of the books
Nov 5 2021,positive,very well done  the movie feels much like the book did  strongly recommend seeing it in theater because the sweeping epic feel is there with the big screen and full sound system there are of course things missing but there is too much in the book to possibly get it all in  i particularly liked the thopters    i went back and reread the book and then watched again on hbomax worth the time if you are a fan of the dune series
Nov 5 2021,positive,visually stunning and politically intriguing dune combines the best of big blockbuster entertainment and smart storytelling into a mix that sometimes feels to grand for its own good but never gets dull or overstays its welcome see it on the biggest screen possible 
Nov 5 2021,positive,it was great not knowing that much of dune now i want more
Nov 5 2021,negative,this is worse then the 1985 version  really really bad  not worth watching
Nov 5 2021,positive,they removed the best parts turned it more into a drama and only tee up part 2 which leaves part 1 feeling light and underwhelming good acting and they fixed the plot lines so worth watching
Nov 5 2021,positive,amazing if you love fiction movies the photography is amazing the sound is great i mean im looking forward for what comes next
Nov 5 2021,positive,it was perfect my favorite movie ever made
Nov 5 2021,positive,i loved everything about this movie and it left me wanting more
Nov 5 2021,positive,very interesting  kind of mysterious and intriguing   opinion of someone who has never read any of the dune books
Nov 5 2021,positive,awesome movie only problem is i couldnt understand what a lot of the actors were saying sometimes
Nov 5 2021,positive,clunky tries to be epic but drags some books arent meant to be movies or some directors shouldnt try to convert thick books into movies doesnt even cover the entire novel
Nov 4 2021,positive,breathtaking it moves slowly at first to establish characters then gathers momentum like a dive bomber the soundtrack is awesome it helps if youve read the books but it will delight you
Nov 4 2021,negative,was tragically boring how do you make a movie with jason mamoa josh brolin and dave bautistta this slow walked near the end save your money unless youre a diehard dune fan
Nov 4 2021,positive,spectacular visual and auditory masterpiece with compelling story and characters
Nov 4 2021,positive,sweeping vistas cool space ships authentic and natural character portrayals fabulous music this movie really satisfies ill be back to see it in a theater again
Nov 4 2021,positive,definitely a slow burn type movie but performances were excellent cinematography was breathtaking the score was alien and ancient a well thought adaptation to frank herberts epic it introduces you into the source material without burdensome narration opting instead to bring the audience into the universe gradually and naturally through the performance of its players  if you want a change from the current crop of pulp film trash it is a must watch for any science fiction fan
Nov 4 2021,positive,very true to the mood of the book i really enjoyed it but every time they show the principle actors out in the sun without their breathing masks on i shuddered at all the wasted water
Nov 4 2021,positive,overwhelming vast vistas of visuals and immense sound scapes a must see at the cinema tackles a dense source material with a remarkably deft touch cant wait for sequel
Nov 4 2021,negative,so incredibly boring this movie did not need to be 25 hours it was so unnecessarily dragged out for the sake of being dramatic that it just became a bore it felt even longer than blade runner what a giant waste of 1 15 hours of my time
Nov 4 2021,positive,spectacular a feast for the eyes and ears  the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because the dialog was sometimes drowned out by the soundtrack
Nov 4 2021,positive,visuals and sound are absolutely stunning it is meant for the biggest screen possible super glad i saw it in imax
Nov 4 2021,positive,i really loved this film good story nice performances and absolutely beautiful cinematography highly recommend this
Nov 4 2021,positive,if you like scifi this is for you music is great special effects are awesome
Nov 4 2021,positive,one of the most visually stunning movies ive ever seen so glad i saw it in imax
Nov 4 2021,positive,as an avid fan of the books i had high anxiety the trailers relieved some of my concerns the movie delivers as best as can be done with the extremely complex material well done i look forward to the future films and the storys completion
Nov 4 2021,positive,so exotic so different must see in cinema
Nov 4 2021,positive,awesome cant wait for part 2
Nov 4 2021,positive,dune 2021 is one of the few movies in modern cinema that elects to stay close to the source material and tell a story instead of relying on cgi explosions or overly hyped battle scenes if you allow it this movie will take you on emotional journey like few others where youll question your perception of life death and destiny 1110 wished i would have seen the movie release day and in imax
Nov 4 2021,positive,this films score alone is brilliant along with the storytelling and characters definitely a must see cant wait for part ii
Nov 4 2021,negative,awesomely bad retelling of the original story frank herbert must be rolling over in his grave  this has turned into a standard avengers style messianic superhero film    if the film were my first introduction to this story i would not waste time with the book since the book was my first introduction i will not waste time with the film
Nov 4 2021,positive,very good cinematic film  it is a build up to a bigger story though but it certainly isnt boring it brings nice visuals as storytelling the soundtrack is on point as always by hans zimmer the cast is exquisite and well what can i say it introduced me to a book series that i didnt know existed as a longtime star wars fan i must say that im very interested in reading the books ive started recently and its good i watched the movie in imax  twice i always like to do that with good films definitely go watch it in theaters
Nov 4 2021,positive,excellent acting great effects didnt rush the complex story  best dune movie made to date
Nov 4 2021,positive,great sound  great visuals
Nov 4 2021,positive,dune is a masterpiece of visual storytelling with an attention to detail and production value rarely seen the way that they realize this scifi world is brilliantly believable down to the little intricate details of set design costuming props and more the mixture of practical and cgi effects are indistinguishable and the result is one of the best looking films i have ever laid eyes upon zimmers epic score shakes the entire theater making the imax experience essential the acting is fantastic across the board every single performer is going 100 the whole time even those in smaller roles the only issue i had with this movie is the pacing which will likely disappear as a problem for me once we get the second part of the story the first half moves along nicely then the second half slows considerably and never picks up the pace again i understand this is the nature of the story they are adapting this movie is giving us half of a very dense book still it feels somewhat unfulfilling to watch this first one on its own perhaps that will be a strength in the long run though because it left me wanting to see the next piece of the story which thankfully was greenlit days after the first chapter premiered denis villenueve continues to show why he is among the finest directors working today i had no connection to the source material and couldnt wait to see this solely because he was the one directing the man never disappoints
Nov 4 2021,negative,the cinematography was good  yet the entire movie was focused on building the plot  when done the movie ended  essentially it is the longest movie trailer that we have ever watched     i presume they will come up with a part 2 to finish the story
Nov 4 2021,positive,grateful that this movie is so successful i dreaded the idea that we would have ended up with only half a story first i love the books and i love this movie but i have always loved lynchs take i knew going into this i was going to love it but i was happy to have this movie exceed my expectations cant wait for 2
Nov 4 2021,positive,as a dune fan this was really really really well done i just want the whole story although i get why it was split into two parts amazing cinematography score character building it was fun
Nov 4 2021,positive,i loved the book and felt it would not live up to my imagination but i was wrong really enjoyed the movie and look forward to sequels
Nov 4 2021,positive,absolutely loved it it never felt like a long movie i could sit there for another two hour and half im glad i saw it in imax im so looking forward to part ii
Nov 4 2021,positive,absolutely superb great cast well scripted storyline stunning effects and from what i remember pretty close to the book cant wait for the next instalment
Nov 4 2021,positive,dune was a masterpiece stunning visuals captivating score by hans zimmer and compelling performances by timothee chalamet as the lead and supporting roles by oscar isaac jason momoa rebecca ferguson and stellan skarsgard it does end slightly abrubtly but it has a satisfying 2 hours to support the jarring end
Nov 4 2021,negative,if you have not read dune by frank herbert or seen the david lynch movie you might consider this an okay movie but you would not have any idea what the real dune was about this movie was shallow and poorly developed the material was presented incompletely and too fast without explanation of what exactly happened timothée chalamet was horribly miscast appearing as a wimpy kid and at one time even crying at his fate rebecca ferguson who played his mother looked and acted more like an older sister or lover the original movie went to great lengths to explain not only the origins of the humans but how the still suits worked the beliefs of the fremen why there were no computers and so many more details this movie barely references one of the most important characters of the book the sandworms while the original movie finishes the entire story of the first novel herbert himself wrote six before he died this movie barely scratches the surface obviously in order to plan for a series of sequels instead of wasting your time with this insipid movie read the first dune novel and watch the 1984 dune movie by david lynch
Nov 4 2021,positive,loved the 4d viewing its the best way to watch it
Nov 4 2021,positive,tldr a fairly faithful movie adaptation of the book with small flaws      having read all the novels and watched all previous such adaptations i found myself hearing the internal monolagues from the david lynch film while watching this movie  which brings me to my one minor criticism a lack of depth  dune is visually stunning  the writting and acting are spot on the tension and pacing are near perfect to tell this story  the choice of break point in the narative is appropriate paul after his first kill and assuming the responsibility of his title as duke and understanding for the first time the weight of what that means  the dialog is sparse and concise possibly just a little too much so to its detriment  i appreciate the absence of the internal dialogs of the david lynch film while at the same time recognizing that their absence leaves the audience with some gaps in knowledge that drain some of the tension and inner conflict from the movie     i left the theater feeling like my prior experiences gave a much richer understanding of the world building  gone are the references to kanly and the political gravitas of the conflict between the harkonens and the atreides the bene geserit ploting is well represented but the guilds involvement is missing and the emperors is perfunctory at best  this causes the entire film to feel somewhat more generic than something as unique as dune should      dune at its core starts from a position of political intrigues suspicions and the members of the great houses being constantly on their guard against one another and even their most trusted advisors and closest friends not being above suspicion  all of that conflict and the accompanying tension is missing from this film because none of it is properly introduced  like a fourpart harmony where the base is awkwardly silent it is missing part of its soul  that is not to say there is not tension but just that a substantial piece of the original narratives basis for the conflict is missing or substantially subdued in this adaptation    it is still a very good movie i can not recommend it enough  it just lacks a bit of the narative depth that makes the series as a whole so interesting and unique  as a fan of the novels i definitely enjoyed it  but as a fan of the novels it doesnt hold a candle to the original work either  very good for what it is
Nov 4 2021,positive,zendaya coleman chani was marketed as one of the main faces of dune despite her seven minutes of screentime chani is a freman native to arrakis and frequently appeared in pauls visions of arrakis and the future although coleman seems perfect for the role of chani on paper she didnt blend into the role as seamlessly as expected her presence in the movie was jarring maybe because shes such a pop culture icon but it didnt feel natural her minute screentime left her character underdeveloped   chalmet had his highs and lows as paul he was more of a messiah than a duke and some of his fighting scenes were gawky and clunky hes convincingly young and immature playing up pauls teenage angst and taps into the spiritual side of his role with grace some of pauls visions arent fulfilled within the first movie and many viewers found that unsatisfying his superhuman connection with spice and with arrakis is very convincing making him a magnetic protagonist   the aesthetics of dune from costume design to color palette give the movie a timeless look the fremen wear stillsuits which conserve water and help them breathe and feature the iconic nasal tube seen in dunes ad campaigns the suits come in muted colors to match the earthy tones of the movies palette the dusty desert scenes which take up the majority of the third act of the movie are filmed in a mix of places like jordan budapest and abu dhabi dune commits to its neutral color palette with great success one might think a beige and brown palette would get boring but the interspersion of sun flares and golden light keeps it interesting action scenes seem to pop against the desert background and when sand flies against the desert sky during fights it looks almost magical   denis villeneuve directed this 2021 adaptation of dune while hans zimmer composed the haunting soundtrack the film is filled with soaring synths angelic opera singing and a score thats more than memorable it sets the tone for the alien feel of arrakis a place that looks so familiar and so foreign at the same time when paul and jessica are fleeing a sandworm and zimmers theme fills your ears you truly experience the height of dune
Nov 4 2021,positive,great movie gave the correct time to explain all the story of the movie background this lack of action was necessary loved it
Nov 4 2021,positive,photography on this film is exceptional as are both the acting and direction the only thing missing for me was a better pace i know part i is just setting the ground for the events to come in future films of the franchise but there were moments that felt completely numb for the storytelling timothée chalamet and rebeca ferguson are simply fantastic i hope the part ii will make up in action what this one is missing
Nov 4 2021,positive,great effects  people who havent read the book can still follow the story  good job overall  ill see the next one for sure
Nov 4 2021,negative,after at least three aborted attempts to read the books zzzzzzzzzzzzzz and years of hearing simply everybody talk about this latest and greatest science fiction story i finally took the easy way out and went to the movie version of dune    as far as i can remember it wasnt as long and tedious as the books    i have always been a strong proponent of reading the book first and then once youve earned the right going to see the movie however in this case i gave myself an exception because its glaringly obvious that im never going to be able to slog through all those printed words sentences paragraphs and chapters to the end of the story just aint gonna happen folks    therefore i gave myself permission to cheat this one time    i wasnt disappointed i wasnt surprised i wasnt intensely entertained i wasnt as bored as i feared i could be i wasnt especially confused or unable to follow the general gist of the story i wasnt especially shocked or surprised at the events that were unfolded and presented in the movie i wasnt dazzled    overall it was generally a cinematic recreation of the orcs and the rohan from the two towers in the strongest action scenes    it was a reasonably interesting retelling of the heroics portrayed by john wayne and the abandoned garrison at the alamo    finally it had components of star wars and the spacecraft action scenes from the battles between the evil empire and the rebels    in short dune had a lot of things that kept reminding me of a lot of other things throughout the entire movie i dont know if the books were the same i dont know if im just getting too old and jaded to sit back and just let the story take me to other worlds but dune never grabbed my attention and took me outside of my theater seat except the two potty breaks i was forced to take its a long long movie    diana left confused about the storyline and the reasons for all of the events in the movie she was distracted by the naked man near the end of the movie though i think he had something to do with her slight lack of comprehension after the naked guy the story seemed somewhat incidental and convoluted    he was a good looking guy
Nov 4 2021,positive,amazing movie a must see for all movie fans everywhere the visuals will captivate you and have you thinking about them for days afterward     the only thing i would recommend is watching the movie a second time on hbo max with captions on the dialogue and material in the movie is extremely heavy and it is very easy to miss crucially important exposition and details with captions on you can see what everyone is saying and you have the power to go back if you missed something     an excellent job by villeneuve looking forward to part 2
Nov 4 2021,positive,beautifully made great cinematography and acting i was new to the story as i have never read the books or seen the original and i did enjoy it
Nov 4 2021,positive,amazing  my favorite part honestly was the ornithopters worldbuilding was incredible i actually wish the pacing was a bit slower so there was more time to get to know the characters and the world but this is a great start cant wait for part 2
Nov 4 2021,positive,beautiful atmospheric gorgeous storytelling
Nov 4 2021,negative,man honestly i feel like they spent all thei budget on special effects and casting the plot was so boring not to mention confusing the characters were 1 dimensional and if it wasnt for zendaya or timothee i feel like no one would have actually watched the movie i had high expectations im sad that it couldnt meet them
Nov 4 2021,positive,ive read the book numerous times watched the lynch film numerous times and this is the version that best tells herberts story beautifully visualized and scored  while theres a lot of details left out  but considering the denseness of the novel  the right choices were made
Nov 4 2021,negative,actors were great but the same ole story thats already been told
Nov 4 2021,positive,an visual spectacle that sets characters and story ready for a sequel perhaps the film feels slow due to this need of introducing the audience to a whole new world
Nov 4 2021,positive,amazing but part 2 will be even better
Nov 4 2021,negative,this movie was so slow and only focused on world building felt like the second hobbit movie where it exists only as a prelude to the rest of the story 
Nov 4 2021,positive,incredible i wished it was longer minus 12 star for leaving out banquet scene
Nov 4 2021,positive,finished the book teo hours before seeing the movie best movie ive seen since the dark knight 
Nov 4 2021,positive,incredible i loved every second of this film it looked beautiful and sounded beautiful movies like this are the reason why i love watching movies in the theater
Nov 4 2021,positive,it was a remake of the orginal movie but a good remake very powerful what i liked was they made it clear that there are going to be future movies which i want to follow
Nov 4 2021,negative,imax review  way too loud  i dont understand why there was constant one note music that droned on most of the film  it literally hurt my ears i stuffed toilet paper in my ears it was so loud  it detracted from the movie im a big sci fi fan but it was hard to like this movie  lots of things seemed overdone for the sake of being dramatic  you cant make an entire movie dramatic for 245 it losses its affect i will watch again just to control the volume
Nov 4 2021,positive,what is a mentat what do the bene geserit do what is imperial training what does the guild think about the atreides how important is water to the fremen why does spice make people have visions why does lady jessica look like a homely b list actress  these questions will not be answered by this movie  and if you love the book youll wonder wtf with this adaption
Nov 4 2021,positive,as a fan of frank herberts trippy classic i was thrilled to see a lot of the scenes from the book realized on the big screen  well acted and quite striking visually    lots of exposition that i must say is handled very well my wife who has had zero knowledge of the world of dune understood enjoyed and followed the story with no issue  my only issue is some of the big hand to hand combat seems to lack impact not sure why but other than that had an excellent experience watching this movie
Nov 4 2021,positive,one of the best movies of the year absolute must see cant wait for part 2
Nov 4 2021,positive,a fresh take with cinematographic brilliance
Nov 4 2021,positive,if you are a fan of dune you will love this film  superbly cast and a joy to watch
Nov 4 2021,positive,dune was very immersive very well shot and had interesting dialogue this movie is a must see but only because it leaves you with a lot of anticipation for part two the movie has great action scenes but is ultimately setting the stage for an amazing sequel
Nov 4 2021,negative,to difficult to followmusic too loud
Nov 4 2021,negative,a slowmoving 3hour intro to end credits
Nov 4 2021,positive,the movie was excellent and very well made the acting and cinematography was great i loved the story and it was much more watchable than the previous attempts very much looking forward to the 2nd part now the long wait
Nov 4 2021,positive,dune is a 2021 american epic science fiction film directed by denis villeneuve      its good   id recommend it if you like this genre       beyond fear   destiny awaits
Nov 4 2021,positive,the bests movie of the year by far easily topping everything of 2020 as well with a slow paced build up setting up its stunning world and story this movie does not hold back both visually and how characters are portrayed in way that leaves you on the end of your seat through the second and third acts of the film unsure if the characters your growing attached to will make it to the end of the movie
Nov 4 2021,positive,extremly hyped for whats to come
Nov 4 2021,positive,good but not at all greatpretty bland and sterile for the most part
Nov 4 2021,negative,very little happened in over two hours boring chalomet and momoa were good movie is boring
Nov 4 2021,negative,idk why this got so many good reviews i found it mostly expositional and an obvious setup for more movies couldve been nice as a series where they took time to develop the story instead of shortcut ting every 10 min to exposition wasnt totally boring but wouldnt recommend i dont think ill be seeing dune 2 or whatever 
Nov 4 2021,positive,the only regret i had watching this movie was not watching it on imax if i knew it was gonna be this good i would have bought imax tickets during opening night   this is what the prequal star wars trilogy should have been dramatic political space drama  not the pew pew light saber boring walking talking polical space drama
Nov 4 2021,positive,amazing denis shows how easily he can handle something that has been considered impossible for decades bravo sir from the etherial visuals to the pounding sometimes punishing drums this movie works
Nov 4 2021,neutral,i was very excited for this movie it would have crazy good visuals intense fights and an epic story in reality the visuals were fantastic the fighting scenes were great but too short and the story was by far the most confusing and unexplained mess i have ever seen in any movie i enjoyed the visuals but as a nonreader of the book i was left confused throughout the movie and i struggled to enjoy it not to say the movie wasnt done well because it was to an extent its just that it felt rushed or story crammed and dullunexplained and that is plain ridiculous for a 2hr 30min movie i can honestly say i understand almost as much story from the trailer as i did from the movie
Nov 4 2021,positive,excellent movie masterpiece in story cinematography and music
Nov 4 2021,positive,it has been many years since i read the books it was refreshing to see a movie following the book which i feel we have lost in recent years i liked how it captured the epic scale of the landscape while still focussed on character development
Nov 4 2021,positive,this movie is great i love this
Nov 4 2021,positive,im not gonna lie it was boring but even though it was boring it was great i enjoyed every second of the movie even if it was really slow and i know this is only part 1 for the franchise so dont expect a movie conclusion by the end but for sure worth checking out
Nov 4 2021,negative,after almost 3 hours of that i might know now what it is like to be lost in an interminable desert with no familiar landmarkswhere you  are removed from everyday human relations and life and you feel that there is some great mystery about what is  going on and what all this means    even though this  experience was driving me crazy enough to want to knife somebody i am not sure that i came away feeling that i am the chosen one of all this vastness and mystery    so the true desert prophetic experience was not mine i regret to tell the director denis villeneuve   maybe you have to be a 14 year old boy or at least a male
Nov 4 2021,positive,gorgeous serious and epic
Nov 4 2021,positive,a pleasant surprise faithful to the original story and the feel it induces a beautiful fusion of writing acting directing editing costumes architecture imagineering cinematography music and special effects just a rare movie in these trying times nothing appears to be overdone and everything perfectly fits together    a big part of the surprise was how little was revealed in the trailers it is rare these days that a movie would be so much richer than what the trailers lead us to believe time will tell whether it will become a classic yet in my opinion all the elements are there    and just like a classic such as star wars it may launch to a higher orbit careers of actors who heretofore werent widely known when you see the movie youll perfectly understand what i mean many of the characters regretfully will be gone in the very first part of the series yet the actors played them unforgettably
Nov 4 2021,positive,amazing in almost every way just a little rushed
Nov 4 2021,positive,never watched the original or read the books fx and cast were very good but extremely slow pacing definitely can see where star wars was influenced but star wars characters were far more endearing
Nov 4 2021,positive,wow  just wow  definitely worth seeing it on the imax screen  see this movie
Nov 4 2021,positive,amazing everything all around was just good good and good part 13 but i eagerly look forward to the rest of the trilogy 
Nov 4 2021,negative,never seen the dune movies or read the book all i can say is this was definitely not what i wanted or expected characters far and few were interesting or built upon not much was fully explained either in writing or forshadowing  cgi was top notch but very little scenes involved these spectacles it was often a movie about a dull teenager that only the hardcore fans would know the lore of and how his story continues to me he was a boring lead im not interested in the sequel but im sure anything will top this bore of a movie like how do you write a movie 230hrs and im left with just meh this should have easily been an hbo max series then it would be something to potentially rival say game of thrones but to cram all this in this time frame this way youd need 3 parts to do this interesting plot justice this is coming from someone that was hyped for this movie and sadly was dissapointed 
Nov 4 2021,positive,gorgeous visuals with topnotch acting a very solid attempt to stay with the book which is huge  very pleased they did not try to jam everything into one 4 hour film instead opting for a more studied approach  cant wait for the next installment
Nov 4 2021,positive,very rock solid all the way around absolutely beautiful cinematography
Nov 4 2021,positive,smart innovative and engaging start to finishnever read the books but still so thrilling to watch a sci fi in this scale
Nov 4 2021,positive,visually stunning and well told
Nov 4 2021,positive,ive never had any experience with dune before  so i have to prepare some information before watching i think is good for opening the universe not so slow and too fast
Nov 4 2021,positive,background music perfectly matched visual scenes great balance to portray the story emotion and energy of the scenes if you dont have any previous knowledge a quick research will make it easier to follow along it had very good action scenes but expected a little bit more
Nov 4 2021,positive,9010knew nothing about this movie coming in and now im hooked super cool immersive world great characters that i cant wait to watch develop give me more 
Nov 4 2021,positive,amazing movie start of the new trilogy the book is amazing as well cant wait for more of this till 2023
Nov 4 2021,positive,excellent story telling movie
Nov 4 2021,positive,great start to a movie series jam packed a lot of information in two and a half hours but did it well
Nov 4 2021,positive,wow what an amazing experience   need sequel no  i read the book saw the old movie and the scifi tv movies and this was so well done that i was left speechless that soundtrack was perfection see this in the theater do it trust me
Nov 4 2021,positive,stunning  gave me hope for the future of the motion picture industry bravo
Nov 4 2021,positive,director understood herberts vision
Nov 4 2021,positive,the visuals and score alone are reason to watchimax if possible never was a fan of dune and wasnt familiar with the lure but im a fan now
Nov 4 2021,positive,i cant wait to experience part ii this is apex cinema
Nov 4 2021,positive,phenomenal movie awesome visuals stunning scenes and fantastic audio mix loved it and would watch it again but in imax
Nov 4 2021,neutral,its weird movie just like the original
Nov 4 2021,negative,very slow and not a lot going on pretty disappointing actually
Nov 4 2021,positive,fans of frank herberts novel will likely love denis villeneuves artfully rendered adaptation but those coming into the universe of dune blind may come away disappointed
Nov 4 2021,positive,imax if possible wholeheartedly recommend the big screen huge film  certainly not the frivolous kind of scifi thats so commonplace true tension incredible score phenomenal cast lives up to the billing a must watch
Nov 4 2021,positive,best scifi i have seen in a long time the scenery music cgi and acting was amazing
Nov 4 2021,positive,this is the reason i love cinema
Nov 4 2021,positive,you enter that world and you feel that you are part of it with the desire to see more excellent performances
Nov 4 2021,positive,dune 2021 is an adaptation of one of the best scifi novels ever by frank herbert that carries the same title i personally did not read the novel and i know completely nothing about the story or plot of dune however i have heard things about how the story or plot of dune is complex and hard to turn into a liveaction film as it requires a lot of work and not anyone can do it dune has been adapted many times and all of them failed for instance david lynchs 1984 dune was described as a flaw attempt however when it was announced that denis villeneuve will be directing the upcoming adaptation i personally was sure right away that he will be doing the best adaptation and he did    if you do not know denis villeneuve by now then you should he is one of the best modernday directors some of his films are prisoners 2013 blade runner 2049 2017 and arrival 2016 as you watch all of his films youll notice some unique and creative similarities between all of them for example the buildup and introduction of the characters or world of his stories he is the only director who is capable of being brave enough to adopt such a hard and complex story or novel such as dune or create a sequel of one the best and most famous scifi films after 30 years of the release of the original one such as blade runner 2049 and surprisingly all of these films turned to be successful and great  villeneuve has his own way of introducing characters and building the world of a story by having such slowpaced films which will seem boring or long for many especially in dune or blade runner 2049 but in dunes case many dont know that this is the first part of a twopart film and story possibly could be turned into a trilogy however this method or style of telling a story in a slowpaced way can be done perfectly only by denis villeneuve and in a way where it will be entertaining and not seem boring or long    alongside that his use and choices of cinematography theme or vibe of the film music etc  firstly the music in dune 2021 is composed by nonother than hans zimmer which felt different and unique this time than other films that zimmer composed like inception 2010 interstellar 2014 or no time to die 2021 where there are simple action or dramatic scenes dune is different and requires different and unique music for that world or story to be delivered explained and experienced well by audience members the music score in dune feels real alive and is speaking to you to deliver the feeling or action that is being shown on screen     dune has a great cast but you will be surprised to know that not all of them have enough or long screen time like zendaya and again thats because dune is an introduction to dune part two so many of the characters in the first part are only being introduced to the audience but will play and have a bigger role in the second part  timothée chalamet plays the role of paul atreides and he is the one that we are with him most of the time since we are following his epic and long journey chalamet obviously plays the role very well which is not a surprise jason mamas didnt present something new its the same type of character shown in most of his films where he is that big strong guy who goes around kicking everyone but it is still impressive to see him in the fight scenes especially that he is in most of them three roles that i really want to talk about and are a complete surprise first oscar issac as duke leto atreides and the father of paul atreides you could see the grandeur and nobleness in his walk or on his facial expressions i have never seen someone who plays the role of a duke that well secondly rebecca ferguson is lady atreides and the mother of paul atreides rebecca plays the role of that frightened mother who is willing to take good care of her son and sacrifice her life for him and she does more than well finally stellan skarsgård as harkonnen the makeup and hairstyle department did a great job in creating that weird creature who you wont know if he is human or a monster whether from the inside or the outside look his voice his face his size his body are all capable of frighting the audience     i really wish if the film was rated r i feel like the story of dune requires blood and violence to be able to show and deliver that world that is full of different characters houses and families that have or follow these weird different traditions the film was missing some disgusting violence and blood specifically in the fight scenes and the  evil villein side    the beautiful cinematography and visual effects capture the beautiful world of dune from landscapes like the beautiful desert with its sand that is designed pretty well and you can see the details whenever there is a closeup or extreme close up shot that captures the sand and the huge ships and planes that are well designed the film is considered visually stunning its full of shots and still frames that are stunning to look at  the use of colors and the color palette of the film or each shot is great the whole film has that brown sand color theme which adds more to the story and connects perfectly to the world and story of dune    the sound mixing  editing are well done although sometimes i felt like whenever there is one character that is whispering i could not hear them very clearly on the other hand the sound of characters stepping on sand is very amazing you can lethally hear every little detail especially the film sometimes has scenes that are in complete silence    dune the film itself and the story or world of dune is huge its a big project that is not easy to be done but with denis and the rest of the crew they were capable of giving one of the best scifi films ever hope the story and film stay on that great level with the 2nd part or the 3rd one if there will be one dune is a story that deserves to be told in multiple parts and not in one film    my rating is 9510  watched in an imax theatre
Nov 4 2021,positive,fantastic story loved special effects cant for the sequel
Nov 4 2021,positive,the movie was amazing felt like i was swept away to a new world that i wanted to stay in watched it a second time and was just as impressed

Nov 4 2021,positive,the performances for the most part are very good but its a bit drab to look at for that long great special and visual effects
Nov 4 2021,positive,visually stunning and respectful of the original text this was a great experience cant wait for the next one in the series
Nov 4 2021,positive,one of the best movies i have seen in a long time coming from having read the book twice this film seemed to be from my own imagination of the story i havent felt so excited watching a movie since watching  the original star wars movies as a youth epic in vision and scope this is a absolute mustsee film especially for any lover of scifi  i believe it will be excellent for those who have not read the book as well
Nov 4 2021,positive,definitely was a big screen movie lots of large machines buildings and  the action was excellent there was an ending that brought closure for this movie but also left it for another one yay we really enjoyed this movie
Nov 4 2021,positive,awesome cannot wait for the rest
Nov 4 2021,positive,i read the book many years ago and the movie faithfully follows the story looking forward to the sequel
Nov 4 2021,positive,i havent read the book to compare the movie but from what i have seen cant wait to see what happens in  chapter 2dune 2 if there a dune 2 soon
Nov 4 2021,positive,enjoyed the imagery music  acting stayed accurate to the book
Nov 4 2021,positive,i especially like that they will take their time telling the story zendaya such a tease loved all chosen actors especially lady jessica flawless performance
Nov 4 2021,negative,too much of this movie hinges on the lead character paul atreides the man child timothée chalamet didnt even come close to pulling off the role dune 1984 remains king
Nov 4 2021,positive,great story it took a lot of time 
Nov 4 2021,positive,great movie cant wait for the second one
Nov 4 2021,positive,dune is one of my favorite books and it would be difficult to convey the book to the screen but they did it and did it extremely well five stars
Nov 4 2021,positive,an excellent piece of cinema flawless acting immaculate visuals and a beautiful score are all accentuated in the theatre environment which makes dune a must see before it is released on vod 
Nov 4 2021,positive,spent most of my time worrying it was going to end absolutely freaking epic cant wait for part 234 and so on
Nov 4 2021,positive,close to the original herbertbookgreat effects sweeping scenery and score underpinnings  of middle eastof course its a science fiction movie so characters are black or white
Nov 4 2021,positive,omg the moms whispering drove me crazy could barely hear her lines during the first half of the movie loved dune otherwise
Nov 4 2021,positive,i wish i hadnt watched the original movie 1st this movie is laid out better but it seems like its about desert storm in the future with giant worms not sure what the worms represent the spices the oil i dont know it was very long movie i would say it easier to understand than the first original movie very good effects pretty good acting not a kids movie
Nov 3 2021,negative,as a mega fan of the 1984 version i have watched dune about 164 times this movie was nothing like the original where the visuals were pleasant the dialogue was horrible completely lack luster and dull i got bored when watching the movie and found myself instead watching the series rome
Nov 3 2021,positive,this is a theater movie the music and sound design in a large theater with a dolby atmos system put you on the planet of dune
Nov 3 2021,positive,amazing universe but they shouldve explored more the mythology
Nov 3 2021,positive,very faithful to the book great effects and sets a star wars for our time
Nov 3 2021,positive,someone get these guys to take over the star wars franchise please
Nov 3 2021,neutral,slow and painfully long
Nov 3 2021,neutral,sound design was terrible huge extreme between quiet and loud i got tired of the score as it felt like it dragged the whole move visually dull with the general color scheme i would have been fine watching it at home and i probably would have had a better time i wouldnt say that this is a movie that you have to see in theaters
Nov 3 2021,positive,i loved this movie movie might be to complex for children to understand and even some adults but i understood everything i love story line cant wait for part two  anyone who doesnt like it just doesnt understand it
Nov 3 2021,neutral,if you saw bladerunner 2049 villeneuve offers more of the same in dune a good cast great visuals breathtaking scenarios the movie is probably worthy of winning the academy award for best cinematography aside from this the plot evolution is sufferable and the pace is extremely tedious the movie really happens in the last thirty minutes leaving an obvious cliffhanger to the sequel this adptation did not justice to the book and could have been a great movie if was not a part i the aftertaste it leaves is like you just saw the all the cinematic scenes from interstellar with hans zimmerman music adding drama but mixed with star wars new sequels level of disappointing storytelling despite the potential of the franchise
Nov 3 2021,positive,excellent story and visual effects
Nov 3 2021,negative,no matter how much i tried to find something to like in this movie i always failed an abundance of dessert made up for the absence of everything else and just like the dessert it took way too long to end an ending that didnt disappoint my disappointment 
Nov 3 2021,positive,as a complete dune fanatic since first reading it at a young age i feel this movie did the story justice there were minor things i would have changed and the movie medium just cant pack the depth that a novel can but you can tell it was made with love and extreme respect for herberts saga have seen it twice already once in imax and highly recommend it
Nov 3 2021,positive,this is what dune fans have been waiting for this movie is visually stunning and gets so many things right even some of the more intricate details i could quibble about some artistic changes but thats all they would be quibbles cant wait for part 2
Nov 3 2021,positive,timmy was so hot bruh
Nov 3 2021,positive,seemed very true to the book  good acting incredible effects i wish part 2 was out
Nov 3 2021,positive,outstanding visually   intelligent and sophisticated in its story telling
Nov 3 2021,positive,wow wow wow seen it 2 times in the cinema and i bought it now at apple this is one of the best scifis i have seen in a very very long time the bar has been set perhaps disney should have a good look at it how you make good movies
Nov 3 2021,positive,incredible acting by the entire cast amazing music perfect cinematography  ive actually seen this four times nyff imax twice and on hbo max once  ill watch again and im not usually a fan of scifi
Nov 3 2021,positive,visually stunning  also tastefully true to the book so far as i am remember but kinda of slow again true to the book and spoiler alert  it feels like its mainly setting up the next movie  at the end it didnt seem to really go anywhere without a huge dramatic climax and resolution like the average american film  im ok with that but it didnt feel like a stand alone movie
Nov 3 2021,negative,endless shots of the desert endless closeups of people staring at each other    french directors think that shows emotion  part one should have ended when paul and jessica crash land and walk into the desert not after they meet the fremen and paul has the duel
Nov 3 2021,positive,did for scifi what lotr movies did for fantasy imho i was stunned at how well it meshed with my vision of the first book that i have read many times since my days in college in the 70s when herberts books were published by a car repair book company bravo 
Nov 3 2021,positive,while it ends more abruptly than expected it is a  very good sci fi film it follows the book closely and the cinematography and acting is phenomenal
Nov 3 2021,positive,the best accordionplaying ive ever seen
Nov 3 2021,negative,aside from great special fx i found this film to be boring difficult to follow and not something that i could continue to watch so we walked out after two hours i was never going to watch the second part so we cut our losses and left for scifi fans im sure it would be great but for me it was awful
Nov 3 2021,positive,never read the books but really enjoyed this movie  very refreshing to see a movie and actually like it for a change  will watch again
Nov 3 2021,positive,so visually and aurally its an absolute masterpiece stunning literally every frame is beautiful so much put into scenes that sometimes last just two or three seconds had to go back and see it in imax but it doesnt get 5 stars as it didnt really engage me emotionally didnt once move meand i can cry at tv ads i felt we needed to experience the pain and headfuck paul the protagonist was going through what was happening to this teenage boy was seriously scary i never felt he was scared plus although i appreciate its only part 1 i felt the climax of this 2 and a half hour film was somewhat underwhelming
Nov 3 2021,positive,the story is told far more indepth than the first dune the film is dark and truly you get the feeling of the desert a very dry desert this part 1 one of the 2 films explains the backdrop of the plot and a basic whos who of the good and the bad without a doubt we are left hanging waiting for the second film that is why only 4 stars and not the 5
Nov 3 2021,positive,i love this movie this is actually the 3rd tike i am watching it this movie serves to introduce you to the characters and their back stories you can tell that this movie is based on a book the cultures and houses are so rich great part 1 and i look forward to the next parts and to reading the books as well
Nov 3 2021,positive,cant wait for part ii
Nov 3 2021,negative,this movie was tiresome bland monocolour scenery oppressive and annoying music average acting with too many a list starslike thanos poe dameron aquaman the bizarre cutting the story in two and then making the first part longer than the original movie the last 30 mins dragged on way too much the ornithopters were interesting but thats about it the 84 movie was far from a classic but at least it was better than this
Nov 3 2021,positive,cinematography  visual effects were amazing great pacing between storytelling and action
Nov 3 2021,positive,wow amazingly beautiful film if you know the lore youll know where the story has been trimmed i want more 
Nov 3 2021,negative,as someone that read the book and watched it with someone who did not  we both felt like it was interesting but all over the place and messed up in many ways many things were missing and the things they missed out on were important  it could be way better as a tv show in my opinion
Nov 3 2021,negative,fantastic performance from fergusson and chalamet others completely melow  and forgettable baron vladimir played by skarsgard is totally benign not scary or  evil at all rabban by bautista portraid too old william hurt as duke leto in the  miniseries was unforgettable but isaac just meh also women in the novel are not  under represented on the contrary they are portraid far stronger than men i have  no idea why liet had to be portraid as a woman thus changing completely chanis  relation with her father and villeneuves dark scenes once again where you simply  are guessing what is going on on the screen everybody please read the books they  are far more complex entertaining and mentally spiritually challenging than this
Nov 3 2021,positive,i think i really liked it mostly because i really enjoyed the first book and could follow the narrative i doubt id really be able to track the story if i hadnt read it visually very stimulating will have to watch again to be sure
Nov 3 2021,positive,denis villeneuve is one of the best living directors the scale set design ship design cinematography and sound editing of dune are masterful
Nov 3 2021,positive,great version lived up to the original movie 
Nov 3 2021,positive,dune part 1s star studded cast and visual spectacle counters the writings shortcomings
Nov 3 2021,positive,wow a scifi movie for adults amazing visually and characters acting like they have working minds looking forward to the second part
Nov 3 2021,positive,a cinematic masterpiece villenuve has created a proper experience the visuals score and story all mesh in perfect harmony to recreate the masterpiece that is the source material
Nov 3 2021,positive,the visuals are stunning and the soundtrack is amazing the less action makes the action scenes more impressive
Nov 3 2021,positive,go see this movie    admittedly its much better if you read the book first but as a standalone film it is still epic it has the film quality of the best westernstyle youll find the sweeping open landscapes and beautiful views arguably the most original and developed scifi universe ever and a host of world class actors
Nov 3 2021,positive,i usually find it unfair to rate films that are based on novels i have read as the inevitable comparison of these two significantly different mediums generally leads to a much lower film rating it is nearly impossible at least for me to experience a better film than the one we create in our minds while reading a story for the first time but villeneuve gets closer than most here    i absolutely loved this film and havent been that into a movie for a very long time as it was ending i honestly thought we had a little less than an hr left and was upset i had to get up and leave probably needless to mention that the pacing was on point for me    the shots of the desert mouse or muaddib in fremen tongue gave me goosebumps and provided one of the many touches of added symbolism found throughout that fans of the herbert series no doubt appreciated    i was real impressed with the casting as well and couldnt find a weak player in the bunch i hesitate to shout anyone out as everyone played their roles well but i was definitely enjoying brolins halleck quite a bit and thought momoa did one of my favorite characters duncan idaho a solid service    the cinematography is to die for the world building is superb and i still have never heard a hans zimmer score that didnt slap    2021 theater 19
Nov 3 2021,positive,i didnt just watched the movie i experienced it the visual and the soundtrack are orgasmic the story is slow burn but in a sweet pace  the acting is superb i cannot wait for part 2
Nov 3 2021,positive,not expecting much i was really happy with the amazing scenes and scope of the project looking forward to seeing the second half complete the story  the ending could have been much better overall i liked the film greatly
Nov 3 2021,positive,saw it in imax last night always a cult fan of lynchs dune batshit mad as it is     but this is next level brilliant visually its stunning the direction is very very strong keeping performances restrained until the right time when the cast are let off the leash jason momoa steals every scene hes in as duncan idaho  his character much more visible compared to the blink and youll miss it of richard jordans appearance in lynchs version although designs are clearly not as mental as jodorowskys dune might have been  seek out the design work of chris foss and youll see what i mean  the clean lines of the guild highliner and utilitarian used future look of the spice production vehicles contrasted well and i need an ornithopter in my life as who wouldnt want to zoom around in a dragonfly     but its the time taken in scenes and the risk taken in splitting the story that pays off the most someone sat behind me at my viewing said it dragged on in every scenecouldnt disagree more theres a huge story here we havent even got half way through what lynch did  and he glossed over two years of fremen insurgency with a voice over that was there just for exposition this version was better for the lack of this is whats happening audio thought bubbles     warner bros have pulled the trigger on part 2 and if its anywhere near as good as this was it cant come quick enough
Nov 3 2021,negative,more of a clip show than a movie
Nov 3 2021,positive,very enjoyable beautifully shot
Nov 3 2021,positive,fantastic movie captured the beauty i imagined while reading the book
Nov 3 2021,positive,superb sound and cinematography 
Nov 3 2021,positive,the photography was beautiful the acting was superb
Nov 3 2021,positive,so not disappointing  yet there were still a couple issues first of which was the sound  in our imax theater it was loud  and muffled  there was quite a lot of dialog that everyone in our group missed and we were not alone in thinking that subtitles would have been a great help for this movie and that we will all enjoy it better at home on dvd where we can control the sound and set up the subtitles  other than sound issues i loved how the story is being told giving us the information that previous movies never did  and should have  even so telling the story well leaves us with what feels like very little actual story being received by the close of this film  it has whetted appetites if not left us a bit wanting for the rest of the story  the part 1 gave away that would wouldnt be getting all of the story this time and that was wise because we might have been more significantly disappointed had we expected the full telling this time around  all that said what we saw was glorious in detail visual and sound  the volume in the theater truly did leave you feeling as if you were there  they could have backed off that just a little  the acting was better than i hoped and i simply want to see more and more of the story now as in right now  i still feel as if there could have been a lot of the story left on the cutting room floor  still  well done
Nov 3 2021,negative,read the book listen to zimmers soundtrack see the movie but try to avoid listening to the flattened simplified script
Nov 3 2021,positive,i really liked this movie when you compare it to the 1984 version of the movie the visuals are much cleaner and since they break the movie into 2 parts you get to see things that the original never could there are some distinct differences when compared to the original but i loved every minute of this movie i cant wait for part 2 to come out
Nov 3 2021,positive,the movie explored a mere start of what seems to be the start of many movies to come excited for what comes next as the next movie should have more action now that the world has been explored and has been set for us
Nov 3 2021,positive,same old explosions fire fighting etc  the special effects were quite good but the constant desert scenes become tiresome after a while  the editors could have deleted a lot of the unrelated sequences  i wouldnt want to see it again
Nov 3 2021,positive,the movie is visually stunning  starts out kind of slow but once you get passed the first 15 minutes or so you will be sucked in  cannot wait for the next one  i am a fan of the books that i read many years ago  holds very well to what i remember about them  even someone who has not read the books should be able to enjoy this movie  i will say that i highly recommend it
Nov 3 2021,negative,poor character development  wild costumes lousy dialog far out visual effects if we cant figure out how to get along with each other by the 31st century then we will have annihilated ourselves long before that time
Nov 3 2021,positive,hands down one of the best science fiction movies in decades the plot is sombre and heady but also filled with gorgeous vistas
Nov 3 2021,neutral,this movie is advertised as simply dune and when you check on hbo max it calls it dune the wikipedia page calls it dune and then when you get in the movie theater its called dune part one what  this movie is really sluggish and boring too i only really got invested towards the end like 10 minutes before it left us on a damned cliffhanger  ill say this though the score and the visuals for this film are spectacular probably the only things that kept me from falling asleep
Nov 3 2021,positive,didnt cram into one motion picture
Nov 3 2021,positive,great story telling in such a limited time special effects were really good
Nov 3 2021,positive,epic the cinematography was absolutely astounding the music was just perfect for this movie
Nov 3 2021,positive,i love dune lore that started from this frank herbert novel see what influenced star wars and game of thrones cinematography is gorgeous pacing really slows in 2nd half of movie still looking forward to part 2
Nov 3 2021,positive,the epic novel dune is one of the greatest works of modern fiction  dune the film is unfortunately not its cinematic equal not be a long shot  however the film has many merits  denis villeneuve stages the film to near perfection with intimate moments shot against a gorgeous backdrop incorporating both the epic and the sublime  the pallet of the film captures the mysticism and epic scale of the book perfectly the issue with dune is not whats been put on film by the directors very capable hands it is in the lack of ambition in actually adapting the source material and core narrative to screen  villenueve is terrific at meandering the subtext of the script and filling the movie screen with memorable imagery but when it gets down to the business of actually telling the story of dune this film adaptation is surprisingly lacking and uninspiring  the story of dune is a machiavellian political thriller a sadistic game of cat and mouse upsetting the power dynamics of civilizations on a cosmic scale  dune the film barely skims the surface of frank herberts ocean of a narrative and that makes this film hard to love for any dune fan      all of this is not to say that dune is not a film worth your time  in fact i would recommend everyone to go see this film on the largest screen possible  it is an absolutely gorgeous film worthy of many awards for its technical achievements in production design sound design score cinematography the list goes on  the film also commands several great performances non so good as rebecca ferguson though who lights up the screen as lady jessica in what is this storys most compelling and nuanced character  ferguson is more than equal to the task here though and delivers what i believe to be one of the years best performances    dune will likely satisfy general audiences more so than fans of the novels and that is an achievement unto itself  dune is a difficult narrative to make palatable for the screen and for that the film deserves a lot of credit  four stars
Nov 3 2021,positive,awesome movie especially if you like the sci fi genre my only gripe was it is a little hard to follow at times
Nov 3 2021,positive,as a fan of the book a fan of david lynchs 1984 flawed version and fascinated by jodorowskys unsuccessful mid70s efforts to wrangle the novel into an epic film i loved villeneuves part 1 effort before entering the theater i knew to not expect a perfect movie frank herberts book is so jam packed with complicated language and characters in a complicated political universe all held together with a familiar world story of power wealth and a people living in a distinct caste system that i am not sure anything but multiple films released over a decade or so could come close to covering the depth of the book and allowing the audience to understand the storys complexity every step of the way like the lynch version villeneuves effort is flawed but still wonderfully beautiful in both sight and sound the acting is compelling and gets us close to understanding each character as a complicated being looking forward to part 2
Nov 3 2021,positive,probably the best adaption of tricky source material that manages to capture the vastness of the planets and universe  i find the woke calls of white saviours and to a lesser extent the lack of time given to the all female bene gesserit order rather funny but as usual i can only imagine these come from people that have little to no knowledge of the original novel series as paul is far from a saviour and the bene influence only grows over time as the novels progress but slow meaningful story progression seems to be something that is all but forgotten in this age of explosions and instant gratification
Nov 3 2021,positive,it really has that x factor that other very succsessfull movie series have i hope the second part is as good as the first
Nov 3 2021,positive,was pretty good story
Nov 3 2021,positive,i knew nothing about dunenever read it didnt see the earlier iteration the acting story and music were topnotch i was afraid id get lost in whos who of the good guys and bad guys but i got it  some might complain that its longi did not mind i like a story that hooks me and i like going on the journey im all in
Nov 3 2021,negative,movie was too long and was very slow
Nov 3 2021,positive,i love this movie i firmly believe it needs to be seen in a theater
Nov 3 2021,positive,enjoyed the first part of the story  the visuals were amazing looking forward to the next one 
Nov 3 2021,positive,i loved timothe he did a wondrous job kinda disappointed  zendaya wasnt in the movie until the last 20 mins unless you count the visions of her but i guess there is a part two so shell be back
Nov 3 2021,negative,boring boring and boring
Nov 3 2021,positive,already a cult movie a movie that changes the direction of cinema with its immersive experience
Nov 3 2021,positive,wow dennis villeneuve was the perfect person to direct this epic adaptation visually stunning and the right amount of slow burn  i loved the pace which was speedier than his previous films   every shot is a work of art  hes the master of clever sci fi the cast is on point and boy what a cast   timothee chalamet is perfectly cast as paul every role almost seemed customly fit to each actor yet jason momoa was the surprise heart of this film   lts no surprise that this does feel like half a movie  which im happy with and glad they didnt rush the second half of the story like the original adaptation by david lynch i cannot wait for the sequel   also at 2 and a half hours it flew by for me   absolutely recommend
Nov 3 2021,positive,its a slow mover especially as theyre seemingly splitting this over two movies but visually its amazing and definitely a must see on the large screen thankfully not just as zany in character behaviour as the original 1984 movie really looking forward to part 2 next year
Nov 3 2021,negative,if you havent read the book or seen the original movie youd have no idea whats going on they miss so many points to the story but like everything nowadays cgi rules and its pretty good 
Nov 3 2021,positive,amazing film that is definitely best experienced on the biggest of screens
Nov 3 2021,positive,i thought this was a fantastic experience ill be honest i am not familiar with the dune property  never read the book or saw the film from the 80s i had heard of it but it just never really pulled me in however the first trailers for this iteration had me hook line and sinker like most part ones to any adaptation it is a bit of a slow burn but it sets everything up without rushing or dumbing things down i felt invested in the world they were building every second of the way its also a beautiful and wellshot film please see this on the biggest screen possible if its still showing in imax near you do yourself a favor and see it if not just get your ass to any theater while its still out its worth the trip my friend enjoy
Nov 3 2021,positive,i have read most of the books and it seems to follow well allow for cinematic changes however the portrayal of paul and his parents was well done supporting characters not so much over all it is the best dune ive seen i loved rebecca ferguson cant wait for the next one
Nov 3 2021,positive,this movie is just awesome the feel of the whole universe cinematography the environment and most of all the fantastic acting  i cant wait for part two and i cant believe they didnt film them together
Nov 3 2021,positive,not really a dune fan but ive watch david finchers dune and this new one is definitely the better ones this probably the best film of 2021 period epic visual epic musical score amazing casts  worldbuilding you really need to watch it on the biggest screen possible to fully appreciate it i really cant wait for part 2 
Nov 3 2021,negative,i really wanted to like this movie but ugh its horribly overdone it tries really hard to recapture the story we were told 3 times before sadly 1984 was amazing but the books were better the tv movieseries was great this is like the 3rd sibling wearing the same handmedowns on picture day seen it but not so special this time and someone grab bautista and tell him to stop acting
Nov 3 2021,positive,so well done it literally blew my mind
Nov 3 2021,positive,with hans zimmers perfect score and villeneuves amazing shots dune is a theatrical masterpiece its easily the best movie of 2021
Nov 3 2021,positive,followed the book very closely
Nov 3 2021,neutral,i left halfway through  i read the books a long time ago and this movie does not seem to be able to stand alone  nice cinematography though
Nov 3 2021,positive,this movie had great world building and great characters this movie also felt very long but i dont think thats a bad thing at times the story was a bit hard to follow but overall a very good movie and i cant wait for the next one
Nov 3 2021,positive,drab colors confusing story line  not enough character developmentcgi was impressive
Nov 3 2021,positive,this movie was everything i wanted it to be
Nov 3 2021,positive,the movie is pure art i have already seen it multiple times
Nov 3 2021,positive,what an amazing effort from villeneuve the sheer scope is breathtaking and he really did an amazing job at capturing the spirit of the original novel very atmospheric and absolutely worthwhile seeing cant wait for the sequel
Nov 3 2021,positive,i watched the film as soon as i finished reading the book which is a mustread for scifi lovers and has many more details and i have to say that i really enjoyed it i had high expectations and was not disappointed at all   the soundtrack is simple but on point the costumes and scenery are loyal to the book and well crafted the cast is superb and the plot is really interesting and original
Nov 3 2021,positive,way better than i imagined loved every performance epic scene action sequence sound edit and track soo awesome
Nov 3 2021,positive,this movie was amazingly done dune is a sci fi classic very hard to adapt to the big screen this movie stays true to the majesty and spirit of the book and doesnt disappoint it obviously wont cover every detail of the book but given the limited screen time the script impressively conveys the nuances of the dune universe and the dune plot im definitely looking forward to the 2nd movie
Nov 3 2021,positive,very entertaining visually and audibly beautiful left me wanting to read the books to find out what happens hopefully the next one keeps a similar vibe and is able to capture what this movie was able to
Nov 3 2021,positive,this director has proven once again with dune why he is one of the best in the business working today a near perfect film in every way with some of the best visuals ive ever seen on screen this is not the easiest story to fully understand i had a tough time with the book when i read it but thanks to be amazing production value and great acting and perfect direction i never felt lost and always felt intrigued especially with the help of one of the best soundtrack by hans zimmer stop everything youre doing right now and go see this in the larger screen with the best sound because you wont regret it i patiently wait now for part two
Nov 3 2021,neutral,slow movie that built to mediocre climax blank holes in the plot

Nov 3 2021,positive,great story great acting great cinematography
Nov 3 2021,positive,gorgeous cinematography perfect casting good pacing with a balance of action and politicking to keep the audience engaged and the story unfolds in a way that is both authentic to the books and yet still easy enough to follow for newcomers cant wait for part 2
Nov 3 2021,positive,fast 3 hours of my life movie kept you on your toes

Nov 3 2021,positive,this movie was beautifully directed with great performances
Nov 3 2021,positive,awesome best science fiction franchise since star wars
Nov 3 2021,positive,top marks in so many waysrewatched it in imax at the san francisco metreon primarily for the soundtrack great inspiration fro my own project
Nov 3 2021,positive,overall enjoyable but as usual the fight scenes and dangerous flight through the sandstorm were long and dragged out the worst part which made me sad because i wanted to sit back and enjoy this potentially captivating story was the deafening sound system in the amc imax theater in kent wa the sound was so compressed that i had to hold my ears shut for much of the movie i have been to rock concerts that were quieter if you see it in an imax theater take your construction site earplugs with you
Nov 3 2021,positive,not the biggest fan of the film and have not seen the original or read the book yet but at the same time dune 2021 is also really good it found the right director which is a stunning feat for days like these with the movies it is absolutely mind blowing in imax saw 2d imax and is like star wars a beautiful epic packed with explosive visual flare and a neat story the sandworms are incredible looking especially with all those teeth the explosions are great looking and a small desert mouse in imax was a sheer great achievement a pretty good adventure adaptation especially in imax
Nov 3 2021,positive,from the visuals to the music this was a wonderful adaptation fantastic job bringing a great saga to life looking forward to more
Nov 3 2021,positive,very impressed with the translation from book to film all the imperative back story was communicated in an engaging integrative way that for the most part kept the audience attention splendidly vfx acting and story were superbly executed a 1010 introduction to dune
Nov 3 2021,negative,i watched the original movie before i saw this one its a real shame the first one was so much better if you didnt watch the first movie you will be utterly lost very poorly written leaves you lost reminds me of a movie mix up of  mad max and blade runner 3 12 hours of my life wasted and bored stiff
Nov 3 2021,positive,loved it all especially the main character  hes attractive
Nov 3 2021,neutral,thought it was beautifully shot and made but the story seemed so vague that it never really pulled me in until the ending
Nov 3 2021,positive,great sci fi movie a must see with great special effects
Nov 3 2021,neutral,it has a lot of repetitive sound bits like they did for wonder woman in justice league
Nov 3 2021,positive,visually compelling but i definitely need to watch it back  felt like a trip  blur  great overall cinema
Nov 3 2021,positive,this film is a masterpiece glad to see the second movie has been greenlit
Nov 3 2021,negative,disappointing and unjust to split it up into 2 parts
Nov 3 2021,positive,fantastic film  sound and scene design were amazing
Nov 3 2021,positive,never given a perfect score to a movie until now 
Nov 3 2021,positive,ive been a huge fan of the book for the past 40 years  villeneuve handles the material as if it is sacred to him  zimmers score is one for the ages  magnificent    while i think that to truly perfect herberts work would require a miniseries to render the character development for maximum impact this format is certainly the best thats ever been brought to light  eagerly awaiting the second installment    update mar 2022  congratulations to hans zimmer for the best score oscar  well deserved
Nov 3 2021,positive,faithful to the book and better than the previous movie looking forward to dune pt2   there are more than one book in the dune series and dune could be a series of movies to challenge the star wars epics if the production quality remains as high as this first movie
Nov 3 2021,positive,sand he killed somebody at the end of the movie
Nov 3 2021,positive,cant wait to see the next one
Nov 3 2021,positive,rising above the recent spate of film and television gleefully pandering to the pc winds that blow villeneuve shows how to make a timeless deeply human statement set lightyears away with a thoughtful and ambitious reinterpretation of frank herberts iconic story a powerfully impactful score from the legendary hans zimmer a talented cast  natural and subtle in its diversity  sets and locations from villeneuve reminiscent of 2049s sweeping beauty and simplicity seamless fx and a minimalist script all contribute to what could be the beginning of a new modern epic series it was a joy to see on a big screen i will be looking forward to what comes next and im grateful that in an age of soulcrushing and simplistic creative misfires filled with predictable claptraps expansive immersive and transformative art with the power to surprise can still be made well done warner and legendary films  and welldone writers denis villeneuve jon spaihts and eric roth
Nov 3 2021,positive,it was okay it has potential to be a really really good sequel but this one was kind of boring and confusing however i do understand that it had to be that way in order to properly introduce the characters storyline and environment its a strong 3 stars timmy couldve been casted better i dont get the hype with him 
Nov 2 2021,positive,the best movie ive seen in a long time very true to the books epic in scope and imagination the costumes and score are fantastic this is denis villeneuves masterpiecepart one
Nov 2 2021,positive,no idea what i watched but it was interesting i havent seen this much drama over spice since the spice girls i am looking forward to part 2 
Nov 2 2021,positive,seeing the movie in theaters for the first viewing is the way to go  loved how it followed the book and that it included some moments from david lynch dune 1984  but directed and executed in a better fashion cannot wait for part 2 of dune
Nov 2 2021,positive,this movie is gorgeous  at only a 2 hour and 35 minute run time not every character will get their book moment   that said  go watch it anyway  and definitely in a theater
Nov 2 2021,positive,it took awhile to get into itpretty good ending that makes you want to watch the next installment
Nov 2 2021,positive,beautifully captured on screen moved at a good pace some initial confusion with who was who in the beginning great acting and special effects i would recommend
Nov 2 2021,negative,lack of explanation for a lot of elements of this movie  felt jumpy  left off with a horrible cliff hanger  right when things were about to pick up  they rolled credits  very disappointed 
Nov 2 2021,positive,dreams are messages from the deep the booming voice and words that open the film dune an adaption of frank herberts sciif epic tells the story of paul atreides a brilliant and gifted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding who must travel to the most dangerous planet in the universe to ensure the future of his family and his people as malevolent forces explode into conflict over the planets exclusive supply of the most precious resource in existencea commodity capable of unlocking humanitys greatest potentialonly those who can conquer their fear will survive most anybody who has been alive within the past 34 years has known dune would be adapted theatrically within the coming years and properly unlike david lynchs 1984 version denis villeneuve was given the opportunity to direct and work with the writing team for this as many of you know he is in my top three favorite directors for me hes made three perfect films arrival prisoners and blade runner 2049 and now a fourth he really did the impossible here by making a film that is too large for any screen even imax world building is a strength of his and dune is the perfect example of how he creates them unlike star wars or various planets in the mcu these different settings and cultures do feel realistic they may have been shot here on earth but simply watching it you never get that feeling were set way in the future in a totally different galaxy the production design team did wonders with this in typical villeneuve fashion he makes things as large as possible the sets though some are done with visual effects are ginormous the visual effects are extremely good looking for the budget they had which wasnt massive they made some of the most realistic looking effects ive seen theres maybe a moment or two where its noticeable but you cant really tell in every scene with something to that size we always have a person or something smaller just to get the scale of it looking at it is entrancing aiding to that large scale look is the practically flawless cinematography its eyecandy for us all the way each planet has a different look helps set the mood perfectly on arrakis and most of the film is set there we have a desert planet that looks so terrifying and mystifying during the day the warm colors are brought out that even make you feel hot while watching and at night it becomes slightly muddy to give the feeling that we dont know whats out there youre on edge constantly one of my favorite parts is actually this shot of paul and jessica running in this tunnel system and the only light is beams from above as theyre running those beams of light hit their shoulders and its framed and looks incredible the fast paced editing that also takes it time works very well this isnt setup like a typical action film where you have one action scene concluding the first act maybe one or two in the second and a big battle with space portals in the third they couldnt even do it if they tried since this is only half of the novel i mean the novel is three books combined technically and we have two more to cover so weve only seen a brief bit of it that might make some people feeling empty towards the end but the opening titles do say dune part one even though its half the runtime is 155 minutes and theres plenty of everything where i dont think you could leave feeling like you havent seen enough i could lost the entire acting ensemble and how they all did but that would take too long all you need to know are the main leads and before i do that we know youre upset zendaya is in it for 7 minutes why is this such a problem yes they marketed her quite a bit but she still has a lasting impact chani plays a huge role in the story and is a big motivation in this first half obviously they were going to market zendaya a lot because shes had a great past few years and also to get younger audiences to come see it since older audiences are going to be the ones who know this story more i digress timothée chalamet is perfectly cast as paul some have said he shows hardly any emotion and never smiles in this which makes it hard to connect let me ask you this what is there for paul to be happy about this is a heros journey epic so theres more development to come some of which couldnt be talked about in just this first half to avoid creating another 1530 minutes of explanation i think his performance and how paul is written is perfectly fine who im really excited to talk about is rebecca ferguson oh my god did she give it her all little did i know she would be the mvp of the film this is easily her best performance to date and i dont think im she could get any better jessica is a very complex character but the way they built her relationship with paul tells us every little detail about her we know this most likely wont happen but with all the praise shes getting for her performance a supporting actress nomination would not be undeserved as for hans zimmers score well theres so much to talk about firstly he turned down working with christopher nolan on tenet for this he always works with nolan and thats where his most iconic scores have come from my favorite score of all time is interstellar and his work on dune is so close to beating it out i dont think people realize how incredible it is he literally created new instruments its incredibly loud and large matching the scale of the film we have the amazing vocalist loire cotler with the most intense and gritty voice belting out there and what i love is how zimmer paces the notes not to get too heavily in music theory but they arent moving fast and arent constantly growing to get the huge sound theres also those juddering drums that never feel loud enough though theyre rattling your skull the entire score feels epic intense and should move you to tears he literally made three separate scores the dune sketchbook the art and soul of dune and the motion picture score for this the total runtime to listen to all three is roughly 438hrs i doubt youll have trouble finding something you dont like ive been listening to each album on repeat ever since seeing it last weekend even the two tracks we were given back in august pauls dream and ripples in the sand part of the sound design is just zimmers score everything sound immaculate and part of the reason you should be seeing this in a theater and not just in the comfort of your living room this film perplexed me to some level i was hesitant to give it a perfect score since thats always a challenge for me i let it sink in while it remained at the close stage once it saw it a third time yes i saw it three times in one week i think i knew my answer there werent really any problems i had with it the minor thing i could say is some of it can be confusing then again once you do your research or simply watch it a second time you can find your answers as someone whos reading the novel it is a hard read it doesnt really stop to answer your questions if you dont know a term you look in the index in the back and learn it for yourself the film explains everything well in my opinion i was left with most of my questions answered that could be denis villeneuve who stated himself that this is his favorite film hes made was the only person to do this project each time it ended and that long runtime flies by in an instant i wanted to rewatch it again since i saw it three times twice in a dolby cinema and once in imax i can confirm that i will have a hard time watching this on a normal sized tv im looking for a big screen but its also the sound that makes it a visceral experience and why i preferred seeing it in a dolby theater over imax while its still in theaters please please please see it hbomax is great for having film in theaters stream for free but you cannot simply watch this and not wish you couldve watched it in a theater the box office for its first weekend didnt make nearly enough as it shouldve or would have if it were only in theaters dune is a modern epic and now that part two has been greenlit i could not be more excited by far the best thing ive seen all year and now for its oscar chances picture  yes director  yes hard category at the moment so maybe a win s actress  no but in consideration adapted screenplay  possibly editing  yes probable win score  yes for sure win sound  yes for sure win cinematography  yes probable win visual effects  yes for sure win production design  yes probable win costumes  yes has to beat cruella makeup and hairstyling  yes 
Nov 2 2021,positive,i am a fan of the books and the film did great credit to them superb film
Nov 2 2021,positive,any of the cast would be killed for not wearing their still suit masks but i can forgive that its really hard to shoot a movie when you cant see anyones face aside from that this is probably the best adaptation of a book ive seen
Nov 2 2021,positive,loved the scope the acting the story line
Nov 2 2021,positive,too much like the 1984 movie  good cinematography
Nov 2 2021,positive,im gonna start with the cons just because there are very little the ending was a bit ominous and the trailer was most definitely misleading to the movie but since i read the book i knew what to expect a little more anywaysthe soundtrack was absolutely amazing in theaters and the cinematography was beautiful the actors were all so amazing whoever was in charge of casting did a great job i cant wait for part two and i hope there are more to come after that
Nov 2 2021,positive,followed the book pretty well great effects excellent casting  music was wonderful but way too loud
Nov 2 2021,positive,a visually masterpice wich is followed by an amzing story that is loyal to the source material give us part 2 now
Nov 2 2021,positive,i really enjoyed this movie ive read the book seen the 1986 movie and scifi mini series this is a difficult story to capture on screen and this movie does a very good job of it
Nov 2 2021,positive,much closer to the book than previous attempts with believable characters definitely going to add this movie to my collection
Nov 2 2021,positive,dune was everything i a fan of the book couldve dreamed the atmosphere is perfect  i felt exactly the same as i felt reading herberts novel which is something i can rarely say about a film adaption an absolute mustsee
Nov 2 2021,positive,dune is a fantastic surprise i was expecting another one of hollywood preaching messed up the story but thats not what we get the movie all in all is fantastic if you have read the books and enjoyed the old movies and series you will love it but be warned two things i really did not like about it but they are very minor number 1 the space jump from caladan to arrakis is really not there you never really see the navigator all you see are ships coming out of the water and then coming out to land on arrakis the second was jessica she seems like a threeyearold scared of being scolded jessicas and the bene gesserits outfits are terrible as well jessica should have been much more confident and strong like the warrior witch she is and you dont get that with her hopefully in part 2 we see more of her like that and not this thats my only complaints i still say its really well done and go see it
Nov 2 2021,positive,wow what a blockbuster denis is a true master
Nov 2 2021,positive,driving home from the theatre i tried to think of what i didnt like about the film and i basically came up empty  dennis villeneuve was correct in saying that it needed to be experienced on the wide screen  visually stunning extremely creative production design incredible cgi mesmerizing soundtrack and last but certainly not least its not marvel  chalamet owns the screen in every scene hes in and i was particularly enchanted by rebecca ferguson as lady jessica  if you need some good scifi escapism from everything going on in the world then this is as good as it gets  i got up from my seat thinking that this will be the next star wars franchise
Nov 2 2021,positive,tough to miss the marketing buzz for this highprofile bigbudget lunge for the blockbuster mantle and what a surprise this time its actually worth all the promotion    in dune the latest effort to convert frank herberts intimidating and productionchallenged novel to the big screen creative heavyweight denis villeneuve has finally realized its potential this is the rare case of a smart lofty sf adaptation that remains fiercely loyal to the source material while also growing in more accessible stimulating directions to appease a broader audience dare i say it i think i might actually prefer this to the book its certainly more coherent than david lynchs screwball 1984 adaptation    clearly plenty of thought and care went into interpreting and adapting the first volumes dense tangled themes for the cinema  villeneuve has confessed to being a lifelong fan  and as such it requires a comparable amount of scrutiny and undivided attention for newer fans to parse but where the novel elaborates upon its wealth of interests a deep dive of farflung politics culture economy and revolution through long dry monologues and descriptions the film is more fluid and efficient we dont have to be told when we can be shown and thats a particular area of strength for a work with this much worldclass production design to spread around god its rife with visual wonders    even the expository bits necessarily wordy by nature are effectively managed to keep the viewers head in the game everything doesnt have to be about talking heads we learn as dune 2021 makes abundant use of subtitles to convey unspoken cues or nonverbal communication that allows us to go far into the conceptual weeds without feeling verbose or static a real godsend to a story thats so inherently brainy and longwinded the ending is a mild letdown a full hundredfifty minutes of escalating stakes that culminates in a few meaningful glances and a see you in a few years but the ride to get to that point is so wellbalanced and riveting that im willing to let it slide how long until part two hits the screen
Nov 2 2021,positive,fun funfun cant wait for the sequel
Nov 2 2021,positive,not knowing anything about dune this was entertaining and i overall enjoyed it from my understanding this is a slow burn meaning that they will tell you all the back stories in several sets of movies i thought this was someones else version of star wars though
Nov 2 2021,positive,i think denis villeneuves dune is a great gift to cinema in general there havent been films like this in a long time  to put it bluntly this film is epic with an epic cast   the director outdid himself and impressed the audience in an incredible way the drama the emotions and the effects he completed the scifi genre   this ambitious director screenwriter and producer amazed me like few others   villeneuve did not create a film where you have to follow the dialogues but rather one where you have to follow the images he expresses himself and presents a film based on beautiful shots     when i came out of the cinema my thought was omg what have i seen   i felt excited and at the same time confused   confused because the plot is not very clear maybe because of the many characters and the fact that each of them has their own story but in the end that is also why it is beautiful   there are two ways to understand it read the book and pay attention when watching it i say the same when i hear criticism about it or when i hear people thinking that there was absolutely a need for an opening scene to explain the setting of the film   in short document yourselves     the events take place in the future in the year 10191 most of the film   on a planet called arrakis its interesting how people are ahead of technology but society not they are inside a feudal society similar to medieval europe i think this because the feelings of human beings are the same the kind of conflicts and the family is above everything   i also find this modernityantiquity conflict interesting   the author of the book frank herbert was a bomb of imagination and a genius and denis villeneuve the same     now lets talk about the music it must be said the composer hans zimmer amazed again every time you heard his fantastic melody you got goosebumps luckily i had the chance to see it at the cinema and thanks to that the emotions i felt were impressive and almost indescribable  music is poetry its an important piece to complete the puzzle of the film and impressive   its fascinating how music can make everything more complete without it the film would have been completely different    now the special effects they are impressive and fantastic   they are so realistic that the audience feels like they are on arrakis and speaking of arrakis  the poetry of the desert is well placed and takes its necessary part   i also find the colour palette appropriate   with tones ranging from greyblue to yelloworange these colours are perfect to describe the surroundings the buildings made by humans and the great expanse of desert that characterises the planet    when you are in the harkonnen house the colours change to blackgrey so it is inevitable that the harkonnen are associated with the colour black     turning now to the acting which i think is excellent at a high level the kind of acting that makes the audience feel the emotions felt by the characters   timothée chalamet played paul atreides fantastically making it clear that he is an admirable actor   likewise oscar isaacs duke leto   against that i think rebecca fergusons character could be less psychopathic and paranoid   in the book shes portrayed as thoughtful and cautious while in the film its as if shes insane at least thats my impression maybe i played lady jessica differently than dv  i also think zendaya could have done more in this movie the scenes where she talks are very few she could have integrated more against my argument though it has to be said that this is only the first movie and another one is to come out     finally i think this film is not just for scifi fans but for anyone who likes to get to the end and not have everything clear in their mind   i recommend it to those who like art within a film and those who like beautiful cinematography and epic shots in general instead i dont recommend it to those who like simple films    thanks for reading this far 
Nov 2 2021,positive,it was a great adaptation  my only major complaints are that the banquet scene was missing and javier bardems atrocious acting
Nov 2 2021,positive,beautifully filmed and acted  awesome is an overused word but is apt here
Nov 2 2021,positive,went in with tempered expectations walked out pleasantly suprised  i actually enjoyed the movie  moved a bit slow but the tone and story telling were good overall most of the characters including the lead were well developed  this is a twoparter so dont expect the full story  saying that i felt they ended the first film in a good spot
Nov 2 2021,positive,dune gives me hope that the cinemas like this big spectacle will get made in the future cant wait for part 2 and the future franchise of dune
Nov 2 2021,positive,theater  if you recline the seats you will have the fence line and bars in your eye sight ugh  bad design though understand why the fence is on each row    movie excellent  if you are a dune fan a must see  looking forward to part 2
Nov 2 2021,positive,this generations scififantasy juggernaut  star wars  the lord of the rings  harry potter  dune 2021
Nov 2 2021,positive,everything is just perfect cast location dialogue mood denis villeneuve is the only one who can bring the world of dune to life
Nov 2 2021,positive,100 out of 100  the masterpiece of the year   cant wait for the sequel
Nov 2 2021,positive,hypnotic work of art    denis villeneuves dune is a unique triumph it shatters the line between art house and popcorn movies heaving its huge budget for effects and stars like a feather and somehow brings frank herberts fantasy scifi to the screen in miraculous fashion    you could see it coming his arrival and blade runner 2049 indicated the scale of his abilities but dune delivers he is the most talented fantasy director and storyteller alive i read the novels long ago and this film told the story well while opening up world building on an unprecedented scale that will be fulfilled in part two of this enormous enterprise lets hope enough paying customers agree it is slow confusing and dark just like the novels i hope the audience who did not read the novels 50 years ago can make as much sense of this film as i did there is some front end exposition and some throughout which helps but the space is there for you to ponder the meaning of what you are seeing    as for the cast timothy chalamet is perfect as paul the chosen one and the supporting cast is as good as you can imagine the effects are beyond expectation including the marvellous bene gesserit voice effects the hans zimmer score occasionally overpowers but it contributes to the overall sense of wonder oh yeah the sand worms are there  and they will no doubt star in part 2    this is the best scifi movie i have ever seen and if it delivers in part 2 it will be my favourite scifi of all time its that good
Nov 2 2021,positive,an absolute wonder to watch on the big screen theaters are back and rocking with dune
Nov 2 2021,negative,one of the most boring movies i have watched in a long time would no recommend and they left it as if there will be another movie
Nov 2 2021,positive,visually impressive with some accomplished world and mythology building but ultimately weighed down by a lack of self awareness emotional depth and chronic under utilisation of an ensemble cast there are some scenes that will stay with the viewer but more because of the unique and unsettling cinematography ambitious production and art direction than engaging characters or believable relationships as a final note this film should have at least been exciting but it flattered to deceive by seeming both kinetic and plodding at the same time
Nov 2 2021,positive,visually impressive and ambitious the acting is impeccable but often times dune tends to drown with its own exposition that it moves at a sluggish pace
Nov 2 2021,positive,while it might feel very fastpaced the movie stays true to the novel and the cinematics special fx costumes and acting are all amazing timothée chalamet definitely shines
Nov 2 2021,positive,its a slow burner and long windedbut its a cinematic masterpiece good job the studio granted a sequel though
Nov 2 2021,neutral,i think for how much they were trying to build up through out the movie the way they ended it for part one was a terrible spot especially for those not knowing this wasnt going to be a full movie with an ending
Nov 2 2021,positive,finally they were able to adapt the book into a good movie
Nov 2 2021,positive,great movie cant wait for the second 
Nov 2 2021,positive,absolutely stunning and an artistic masterpiece of cinema i have seen this 3 times now and plan to go at least once more experiencing it an imax is a truly incredible event that everyone should go do
Nov 2 2021,positive,i have watched this movie two times now and i know nothing about the books or the old movie but this is masterfully shot amazing acting and the score and sound effects are top notch
Nov 2 2021,positive,visually there is no one who does scale and grandeur as well as he does casting was fantastic with maybe mamoa as the exception  i guess they needed some box office draw power  aquaman as picked by actuaries   its hard for him to not standout in a bad way when you have so many pros both new and old i felt the pain along with his hand in the box  but it was kinda strange how the movie felt both too short and too long too short as there are so many characters i really really want to see more of as their few lines were simply amazing  the menacing of the baron rabban and devires were amazing  and too long with too many scene as people charging each other like little ants on the giant battle field canvas  i am probably not the target audience but i could easily sat through another 3hrs if the rest of the time was more about those fascinating characters and themes of power and control and meaning and manipulations  i totally loved all those spectacular scenes and crazy cool costumes  that opening scene with the herald of the change wow what amazing ambience   but that ambience and setting and mood would make this a 65 star movie if it was built around more character drama and dialog  but thats personal taste as i am sure a lot of people would hate that  regardless i still loved it all maybe with part ii it will feel like a whole film
Nov 2 2021,positive,i had read the book my so hadnt but was able to follow the plot so excellent storytelling highly recommend seeing in imax  the visuals and sound are incredible this adaptation makes the latest star wars look like tiddy baby bs
Nov 2 2021,positive,this film is ahead of its time in so many ways the detail and though put into the adaptation will in my opinion be a new benchmark for scifi films going forward
Nov 2 2021,positive,the movie is spectacular the experience of watching it in the cinema is unparalleled in terms of visuals framing acting and above all grandeur its perfect but it has a very slow rhythm which despite not being a negative point may displease some people and lastly its too grand in terms of plot and leaves an absurd hype for the second part
Nov 2 2021,negative,fandango gave me the wrong seats the theater layout was not the same as their seat picker and i got put on an aisle seat when i paid for two center seats
Nov 2 2021,positive,slow burn but great creativity and solid storytelling
Nov 2 2021,positive,i havent seen dune show neither have i seen any previous animated or liveaction dune adaptation it was my first time experiencing this story  a dune newbie if you will i am going to have to judge this film accordingly i had heard that understanding this story has a lot of prerequisites like many families sidearmies an emperor and so on ill say this version dune 2021 movies very quick with that and just throws a bunch of information at you and expect you to understand it for that i will have to admit the film comes a lot heavyhanded in the first half when youre figuring out whos who thats first of two gripes with the film the second thing i was not particularly a fan of is the ending though we know a nowgreenlit sequel is coming the ending does not feel coherent and satisfying with everything that we saw before everything else  directing acting cinematography set design costume design visual effects and soundtrack are fantastic it feels like the people involved in the project really put their soul into making it i saw a video in which director denis villeneuve read this book when he was a kid and it stuck with it every shot in this film oozes with love and passion my only regret was i got to see it on the small screen and not experience it on the cinema if you are planning to watch it and i would suggest that you do make sure you have the largest possible screen to do so cheers
Nov 2 2021,positive,best movie of 2021  
Nov 2 2021,positive,i didnt have much faith that someone could bring frank herberts dune to the big screen but this was a phenomenal effort i dont see movies in theaters much these days but do yourself a favor and watch this on the big screen the soundtrack is meant to surround you and pull you into the world the vistas are too big for a tv ive been a fan of the books since i was a kid and i cant think of anything i would have changed about this movie you can tell villeneuve came at this from a real love of the source material looking forward to part two
Nov 2 2021,positive,cant wait to watch the sequel
Nov 2 2021,positive,space opera grand scenery but basically a medieval chivalric romance with spaceships spectacular and entertaining but not thought provoking as science fiction
Nov 2 2021,positive,it had nearly all the ingredients for a great film  interesting characters great dialogue sound design breathtaking cinematography however i cared very little for the plot or story world and had no idea why i should care about anything that was happening it also didnt feel like a complete story i understand its suppose to be a possible trilogy but other trilogys first movies always felt like they could stand on their own as a complete story that wasnt the case here
Nov 2 2021,positive,i cant help compare this iteration of dune to the original movie from the 1980s and in many respects this is better  the effects are amazing and since it is being made i 2 parts it was able to take more time with the mythology and setup for the events on arrakis    my biggest complaint was the casting for this film  i loved the casting for duke leto lady jessica duncan and gurney but found the casting for paul and chani off putting as i expected paul to be more manly and chani to be more attractive      overall it is a good film  it isnt necessarily better than its predecessor but overall worth a watch  a good effort
Nov 2 2021,positive,movie was amazing highly recommend the movie 
Nov 2 2021,positive,pretty spectacular denis villeneuve is one of the greatest filmmakers working today
Nov 2 2021,positive,denis villeneuves adaptation of the 1965 novel by frank herbert is one to applaud for its cinematography production design and overall visual spectacle i will even go as far as stating how impressed i am of the newer adaptation being an improvement over the 1984 version the film definitely sets up its world in a way that will have you immersed into it from the compositions and blocking to the color palettes to the set design to the musical score the movie overshadows a lot of its downsides in a way that the visuals speak for themselves rather than actual lines the movies pacing at times can be a bit slow but at least it utilizes its time building a world that you can come to be infatuated with the movie is very straightforward in its plot so characters may at times have some emotions but then at other moments they do not either way the visual spectacle of the film is one to admire the most so watching this in the theater will not be a major disappointment all in all i will give this film an 8 out of 10 or a 80
Nov 2 2021,positive,a feast for your senses visual sound and mind  the acting cinematography sound story all come together to form  a masterpiece    i have not experienced a movie of this level in a very long time  the wait for part two will be arduous
Nov 2 2021,positive,this movie was amazing from start to finish intense and original would watch it again and again
Nov 2 2021,positive,amazing visually stunning superb acting 
Nov 2 2021,positive,the movie was beautiful and every actor brings it top notch performance  the main villain is super menacing i cant wait for part 2
Nov 2 2021,positive,the beginning was quite slow however it picked up and you really started to get into characters and wonder what will happen next
Nov 2 2021,positive,1010 highly recommend this movie sets the new standard for epic filmmaking
Nov 2 2021,positive,an absolute cinematic masterpiece as a fan of the source material it is abundantly apparent that there is a true reverence and deep understanding in this most recent retelling its seen in the casting the visuals the adherence to the iconic dialogue in my opinion this is denis villeneuves magnum opus pt 1
Nov 2 2021,positive,1984 dune main theme was burned into my head the first time i heard it  i will never forget it  in the end all this movie had was a lot of fancy sound effects gently coersed into music  is any music from this movie stuck in your head  no music in this version came anywhere close to the scene in 1984 version where the thumper seamlessly bleeds into the main theme    to be fair the sound effect music overall was fantastic  but there is no powerful memorable linchpin  its just musicsound effects that could fit in many movies  the only reason i even posted this review is because i read some bull about the composer thinking about the score for 50 years and not watching 1984 version because he didnt want to ruin the dune music in his head load of artistic bs    as for the movie very ambivalent  some parts are amazing others kinda suck  very little inbetween  so much time to fill but left unfilled of details it could have had for the sake of being drawn out slowly and overdramatically  as far as modern movies go they mostly suck this one is great  on par with 1984 version  they both are amazing and suck in different ways
Nov 2 2021,positive,having only recently read the book the movie was everything i was hoping it to be  cant say that about a lot of booksturnedmovies the book is still a must read however
Nov 2 2021,positive,great movie  the storyline the actors and the special effects were very good  i watched the movie twice at home on a large screen tv and then at the movie theater  its much better at the movie theater  looking forward to the sequel
Nov 2 2021,positive,slow start but good overall i think its pretty good i expect part 2 to be just as good
Nov 2 2021,positive,im interested to see where this saga will go i recommend seeing it in imax if you can the movie is visually stunning and the special effects are on point it feels like technology has caught up to the book to finally tell the story right
Nov 2 2021,positive,all of itthe storythe photography
Nov 2 2021,positive,i loved it to me it felt like a mix between star wars and lotr and it kept me pulled in and entertained the entire time im so excited for the next film
Nov 2 2021,negative,there really was no plot and the movie was too slow
Nov 2 2021,positive,this my second viewing and it was even better
Nov 2 2021,positive,visuals were aweinspiring and the score while a little overwrought at points was definitely one of hans zimmers triumphs  i would have given it five stars except for its departure from the book where i felt it did the story a disservice    not overly enthusiastic about where the director opted to stop the first film a matter of personal preference though and i look forward to the next film
Nov 2 2021,positive,scenery and cinematography  story  cast  excellent adaptation of book
Nov 2 2021,positive,even better than the 1984 movie  better acting better presentation better and deeper story  cant wait until part 2 in 2023
Nov 2 2021,positive,awesome from start to finish timothy c especially was amazing
Nov 2 2021,positive,great atmosphere and production  the story is more clear than the original  waiting for part 2
Nov 2 2021,positive,maybe even harder to understand than the lynch movie for newbies but for dune nerdsi loved it after they met keynes i thought the pacing was spot on with the book
Nov 2 2021,positive,fantastic a movie that finally made me go to the theaters to go see
Nov 2 2021,positive,story was a bit clunky and dialogue was a little rough but the soundtrack and visuals were amazing
Nov 2 2021,positive,ive watched it 3 times and was not expecting such a good movie as the original was a bit strange of a scifi for me to watch very well done movie the second time around
Nov 2 2021,negative,no real acting shallow predictable plot mostly special effects that do not compensate for a story that drags and gets repetitive really quickly
Nov 2 2021,positive,perfect atmosferic epic the ornithopter rendition was enough to pay for the movie not to mention the verbatim delivery of the most important speeches  priceless
Nov 2 2021,negative,i was so bored i walked put of the cinema after 20 minutes when all that happened was chalamet having desert dreams and his mam crying i stayed outside for 30 minutes went back into chalamet still having dreams and his mam crying again i sat for 10 minutes then turned to my friends apologised and left as quickly as possible get away from the utterly dull battle that had begun
Nov 2 2021,positive,great acting and cinematography but where was the navigator
Nov 2 2021,positive,epic adventure heavy with world building that is gripping throughout
Nov 2 2021,positive,all encompassing soul consuming attention hooking absorbing  engaging engrossing enthralling  gripping immersing  riveting
Nov 1 2021,neutral,ok this is over hyped and mediocre david lynchs version is better in my opinion that was not perfect either but the cast got their moments and stick out in your mind after you see the movie  infact the dvd mini series is better  this is not an epic and the greatest version of the novel  its ok and looks good and sounds good cast are good but no real stand out performances   ill stick with the 80s movie thanks with all its faults  but the fawning over this movie is mass hypnosis  its not a bad movie but its not epic or oscar winning as we were all told it was going to be
Nov 1 2021,positive,i liked it sets itself up good for a trilogy 
Nov 1 2021,positive,this film was absolutely brilliantly stunning if anything what i dont like is that there are only five stars everything was awesome the greek phalanx the atreides use the amazing attention to detail the buildings and machines the music everything was awesome
Nov 1 2021,positive,beautiful cinematography powerful score and a compelling story
Nov 1 2021,positive,disappointing it was just remake of the 1rst with some of the same dialog special effects were good
Nov 1 2021,positive,loved it cant wait for part 2
Nov 1 2021,positive,wow what a beautiful and engaging story gorgeous visual depth of character unafraid to handle deep matter politics gender etc this was just a wonderful film i am glad too because the old one was sooo ugly and weird and nonsensical bravo
Nov 1 2021,negative,visually stunning but poor job on keeping frank herberts incredible story barely touched on the intergalactic politics left out all the details of the weirding ways no buildup of the prophecy of the freeman believing paul is the one little time spent in the important moments of the book that make it such a rich and complex story the worst thing of all is the way jessica is portrayed in the book she is a zen master able to reel in her emotions to be in a place of clarity from her years of training but in the first movie she is a weak hot mess a big fan of dune who is disappointed visually is wonderful but the storyline is choppy and weak with skipping over much
Nov 1 2021,positive,while dune struggled with its worldbuilding and had some difficulty adapting the complexity of its source material its regardless wonderful to see a big budget hollywood movie that actually feels like it was made with a lot of love and ambition i do recommend reading a quick synopsis before watching because the plot is actually quite engaging once you understand the politics and to add onto that it boasts a stellar cast and some of the most amazing visuals ive seen since lord of the rings in an age where most big budget sci fi movies are soulless cash grabs and the corpse of star wars is being repeatedly desecrated for all its worth dune is a refreshingly earnest and exciting adventure
Nov 1 2021,positive,cinematic and well acted  cant wait for part 2
Nov 1 2021,negative,nothing but a big prologue with good wallpapers with no emotion no character development or narrative to care about
Nov 1 2021,positive,its just the beginning loved it
Nov 1 2021,negative,really slow confusing often dialogues not clear many times not worth it at all
Nov 1 2021,negative,dul dull dull this is a 1990s mini series not a film chalmet mumbles and pouts ferguson and rampling are no substitute for sian phillips and francesca annis no humour drawn out exposition and really no visuals that deserve a big screen
Nov 1 2021,positive,ive read the book multiple times watched the first dune movie many times but this was a great adaptation of the first book i wish the second part was ready now
Nov 1 2021,positive,a visual masterpiece with a thrilling story that will leave you excited for its sequel
Nov 1 2021,positive,enjoyed it but we read the books and saw the 1984 movie  the special effects were super hintbathroom break when the copter thing with the mom and son crashed in the sand
Nov 1 2021,positive,great cinematography some of the acting was sub par
Nov 1 2021,positive,dune is not just a movie it is an experience and shot specifically for imax it begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible the best part about this film is that its only just the beginning and part 2 will most likely be just as epic
Nov 1 2021,positive,great storyline cant wait for the next one
Nov 1 2021,positive,having not read the bookfull disclosure i will still say that this movie was a great film and definitely one of the best sci fi movies ive seen in a very long time you could tell that it was adapted from a novel by the way that it explored character growth and relationships more than the average space movie another aspect that i appreciated was the subdued use of action and fighting throughout most sci fi movies often rely on action and long fight sequences to make their movie stand out but dune explored other areas that made it such a unique and fun film to watch all while not sacrificing the awesome scale of action sequences when they were required moviegoers can get their fix of intense and beautifully choreographed fight scenes while also experiencing a deeper level of cinema the director also does a great job of not overcomplicating the story sure there are pieces of the book that i am sure we have lost but its a movie and not everything can fit backstory and lore are easily summed up for the viewer especially with how much there is to see in the galaxy of dune 1010 film with beautiful music as always by hans zimmer the master
Nov 1 2021,negative,its like someone made a dumbed down version of the book with 5 of the complexity and context of the universe then someone made a dumbed down remake of 13 of that movie
Nov 1 2021,positive,very good movie one of the few blockbusters that are worthwhile in the last decade i look forward to an extended version or some more cuts and above all i want the second part of this great epic
Nov 1 2021,positive,great for a film trying to pack 1000 pages into a 25 hr movie there is still plenty more information that needs to be conveyed we will watch this franchise with great excitement and expectation
Nov 1 2021,positive,i love to watch movie and wonder what to expect next or where the events are leading this movie definitely delivered and the visuals are so stunning the acting is on point and the story is mysterious fascinatingly immersive and purposeful they know what they want to achieve and they have eveyone on their toes waiting for it this movie is definitely worth it
Nov 1 2021,positive,this is a terrific film there is a lot going on just enjoy movie 
Nov 1 2021,positive,i watched the movie in a rpx theatre it is visually great the dessert the stations spacecrafts the blue eyes etc i loved all the scenes with the sandworm however the same soundtrack came on regardless of them trekking viewing the landscape or when paul aterides is demonstrating his powers or at least it felt that way because i heard the soundtrack in moments where i did not find it fitting it is a great powerful soundtrack but i would have liked more variety in middle eastern soundtracks with different tempos and pitch there is something missing in the movie there were many scenes i liked but just as many where i was disengaged its not a complete movie it is a part one enjoy the character development of paul aterides and be transported into the world of dune overall it is worth watching
Nov 1 2021,positive,i have not read the book and was unfamiliar with the storyline i found it to be very engrossing and thoroughly enjoyed it   cant wait for the sequel timothy chalamet is awesome
Nov 1 2021,positive,as a book fan i was very nervous about this film it is hard to pin down and adapt but going to the theater and experiencing the visuals and score resolved my fears i was utterly blown away by villeneuve talent to direct it is the most faithful adaptation of herberts work bar none and top contender for my favorite film ever it is an epic that you have to experience
Nov 1 2021,positive,for cinephile or art lover might love this film dune is a wonderful in art form of scifi space opera movie it has the best cinematography ive ever seen that show you a larger scale of it world featuring with amazing cinema score composed by hans zimmer the movie is long and    very slowpace but every scenes does take your breath away with its special effect and film composition it story mostly involve in world building and yet a little too much to digest for nonfans of dunes novel there isnt much action sequences but it does come much later in the film than you might expected you had been warned most of the first act are dialogue and the second act came pretty much lately in the end this movie does an amazing job but might not be what you expected from what you seen from the trailer yes this entire film is only part 1 and leave you a cliffhanger its a really long movie
Nov 1 2021,negative,first the good dune is a cool scifi world and the story has a lot of potential there are some beautiful shots and great cinematography and thats where the good ends the bad this movie is so slow terrible terrible audio mix we had to turn on subtitles because we couldnt understand any of the words and we have a high end dolby atmos surround sound system this is some of the worst story telling i have ever experienced there is hardly any action and overall it seems like a wasted opportunity to make a great film the story really has incredible potential but it was told in the worst way possible
Nov 1 2021,positive,the spice must flow
Nov 1 2021,negative,it was a level below boring and dumb  seriously wish that i could get my money back  in 46 years of life this was by far the dumbest movie ever
Nov 1 2021,positive,great story awesome visuals
Nov 1 2021,positive,good story and well done
Nov 1 2021,positive,the worms were awesome would have liked less captions the ships were awesome cant wait until the next one
Nov 1 2021,positive,great story first time watching dune watched it in theaters twice hope they have a 2nd movieneed more please 
Nov 1 2021,positive,gallantly directed with amazing visual effects sound soundtrack by zimmer and many clever cinematic allusions and performances in complete accordance to his style villeneuve refuses to spend time on almost any exposition movie visually introduces concepts and doesnt try to verbally explain them via characters that should know all that already which was one of the biggest problems in all of the previous adaptations and across other numeral scifi films and i must commend a giant studio blockbuster in giving any credit to audience to figure something out on their own the obvious fault is that its not the whole story and it really awkwardly ends which is a given but i cant overlook this in good faith and the other one is specific to me but i really didnt feel any heat from arrakis the color pallet made it seem bleak and cold
Nov 1 2021,positive,if you love the books youll probably like the movie well enough however they changed a lot from the books events are combined and happen out of order characters are completely changed important lines from the book are left out entirely i enjoyed the movie but i was disappointed that the director felt the need to change things so much for no other reason than he liked it better that way if you dont like the story the plotline and the characters make a movie from a different story its a wellmade movie but i wish it had stayed truer to the book
Nov 1 2021,positive,loved it i read the books a while back and i think this movie looks and feels like the book series a goth space opera the only complaint i have is jason momoa i like him but not for this movie he seemed out of place he always plays a bro now he was just a space bro everyone else for in perfectly
Nov 1 2021,positive,fascinating mature and thoughtful audiovisual spectacle    those who complain about the ending need to understand that the second part will be fully dedicated to the best part of the dune story instead having rushed story like in 1984 dune its a good thing that they ended the first part where they ended it
Nov 1 2021,positive,absolute masterpiece surely one of the best movies of the decade
Nov 1 2021,positive,the true imax experience was worth it the taller screen made it feel like i was transported to these fantastic worlds the transitions between the full imax and the normal movie height always get natural
Nov 1 2021,positive,denis gives more fresh and different folklore to dune the middleeast culture and setup for a lot of referrals cinematic is topnotch it would mesmerize your eyes and give a relaxing bath to your brain
Nov 1 2021,negative,slow boring long loud
Nov 1 2021,positive,compelling story line beautiful cinematics these films are destine to become classics anticipating the next chapter with impatience
Nov 1 2021,positive,absolutely amazing astonishing and unbelievably good
Nov 1 2021,positive,i thought it was a great film i barely felt the run time as a fan of the books that i have read a number of times i felt like this interpretation of the book really drew me in despite knowing what would be happening i especially like the way they layer out the stakes in the opening without unnecessary expiation which would have seemed out of place looking forward to part 2
Nov 1 2021,neutral,this movie was ok hence the 25 rating but there was nothing exciting about it nothing that grabbed me  it was just a meh movie  maybe part 2 will be better
Nov 1 2021,negative,a 21stcentury piece of shit grandiose pointless shortsighted this version isnt even as good as versions done decades ago it fails to tell the story and  infuriatingly  ends the movie twothirds of the way through the story the way to have done this right would have been lord of the rings style  a trilogy ending with god emperor of dune i took my fiancé who hadnt read the book to see this and she had no idea what was going on and i cant say i blame her please dont waste your time or watch the first version with kyle mclachlan instead
Nov 1 2021,positive,from start to finish i was entertained and intrigued dune is a film like one i have never seen before and i quite liked it oscar isaac gets my thumbs up for best performance as well im very much looking forward to part two
Nov 1 2021,positive,very well done with an amazing cast
Nov 1 2021,positive,this is a really good movie it manages to be unpredictable interesting engaging and a visual delight thats not easy
Nov 1 2021,positive,i enjoyed it and look forward to dune 2  the visuals are engaging  the story was slow to progress at times my husband dozed off more than a couple of times
Nov 1 2021,positive,this is an exceptional movie it draws on dune and star wars but everything is good about it from plot to actors and special effects very entertaining and not as light as one would expect very good effort absolute must see
Nov 1 2021,positive,of all the movies in 2021 so far this most merits a trip to the big screen      story faithful enough to the book to please its readers  some subtleties might be lost on the viewer  its more grounded and mature in many ways than the mcu grade scifi we typically get these days  i think it was wise to give the story room to breathe by ending the film where it does  that said is quite long so be aware      visualmovie going experience excellent  costume design set pieces vfx the works  it can justify an imax admission  the audio experience also plays an important role in such a way that a theater sound system is best  ours was loud      edit after looking into this online it looks like the general consensus is the movie is just plain loud  i think it kinda ruined the experience for my wife and others so maybe bring some appropriate earplugs or otherwise be aware
Nov 1 2021,positive,could have been betterlike the original 1984 version
Nov 1 2021,negative,worst movienoting memorable really happens
Nov 1 2021,negative,dialog very hard to understand music too loud very poor sound quality
Nov 1 2021,positive,movie was too loud but interesting
Nov 1 2021,negative,dune was by far the worst movie i have ever seen in my life no story line and ridiculously bad content view at your risk you have been warned
Nov 1 2021,positive,follows book better than 1985 film great staging in every shot good to great acting in keeping with the book characters cant wait for 2023 and part 2  and now everyone knows where george lucis stole the concepts for star wars
Nov 1 2021,positive,great movie lots of action cant wait to see part two
Nov 1 2021,negative,would have been better as a series on netflix  2  and a half hours of nothing going on  im guessing this movie sets everything up and  all the good stuff happens in part two  if not its 2 and a half hours ill never get back
Nov 1 2021,positive,this was a wonderful film very actionpacked although i have never read the book i was told that it followed the book
Nov 1 2021,positive,never read book but movie had my attention and kept it
Nov 1 2021,positive,great its only 12 a movie but what was shown is fantastic cant wait for part 2 in october 2023
Nov 1 2021,positive,when is the sequel coming out please dont tell me ill have to wait 2 years  this is a marvelous adaptation of the book  the cinematography is superb the tension in the story is palpable the action scenes are amazing
Nov 1 2021,negative,i couldnt follow the story line or what the plot was about it was too long and seem to go on forever without much story
Nov 1 2021,positive,a nicely done adaptation of the book
Nov 1 2021,positive,just missing the dragsqueens from moebius storyboards  concept art for jodorowskys dune
Nov 1 2021,positive,dune drags its feet a little toward the finish line but what comes before is nearly twohours of intricate worldbuilding that gives the best sciencefictionfantasy properties a run for their money the cast is superb and the technical execution is flawless from greig frasers cinematography to zimmers captivating score theres really nothing quite like it
Nov 1 2021,positive,good story great actors and acting drama that held my attention the entire 25 hours  a bit long
Nov 1 2021,neutral,great special effects amazing cinematography a very realistic scifi universeso what a disappointment when i realised i simply didnt care about any of the characters
Nov 1 2021,positive,weve waited so long to see this version of herberts dune  and by this version i mean the version that got it right it was worth every minute waited and every penny spent to see it i recommend seeing it in a theater if possible
Nov 1 2021,positive,a must watch in movie theaters an audiovisual wonder good job of keeping to the original story line part two will make or brake this movie tho but right now its awesome
Nov 1 2021,positive,visually well done the score fit the tone the whole way through the movie and the storys pace for you to process whats going on was stellar
Nov 1 2021,positive,could have been 2030 minutes shorter without all the long full face ultra long reaction shots eventually became boring until titles ran i was unaware that it was just first part of whole movie disappointed
Nov 1 2021,positive,being im no fan of scifi and really dislike mythic battle films im at a loss as to why i enjoyed this film so much  maybe it was timothée  chalamets very unlikely hero   or that no one spoke some annoying gibberish language  or that the special effects didnt look like toys on my modest television screen  although the film is so beautiful id recommend you see it in a huge theater  maybe its just director denis villeneuve really knows how to make a terrific movie
Nov 1 2021,positive,great unique story great acting
Nov 1 2021,positive,special effects made the environment of the movie very realistic the story moved slowly
Nov 1 2021,neutral,there are some cool things going on here like the awesome sand worms  however for me its one of those this looks really good but i dont know what the hell is going on type of sci fi movies
Nov 1 2021,positive,the costuming is gorgeous  the spaceships and scopescale are astounding  the whole first half of the film is breathtaking the climax is sort of in the center and the second half tapers off quite a bit
Nov 1 2021,negative,worse movie ever hated how the movie ended a sell for a sequel total waste of time
Nov 1 2021,positive,simply beautiful an amazing i left the cinema astonished
Nov 1 2021,positive,a phenomenally made film some of the most immersive and captivating scifi ever i recommend it highly if you like methodically paced atmospheric movies and especially if you like villeneuves other movies if youre expecting something light and fastpaced like star wars or marvel its not for you my only major complaint is that its very much half a movie as it only adapts half of the book but im psyched for part 2
Nov 1 2021,positive,follows the book such a good movie
Nov 1 2021,positive,great cinematography and music score but i felt empty in the unfolding of telling the story
Nov 1 2021,positive,really really decent i saw the david lynch version on its initial day of release in north america and i have to say that this version is better
Nov 1 2021,positive,immersive beautifully crafted packed with details but not overwhelming must watch at an imax you wont be sorry slow burn but has enough action throughout not to bore you cant wait for second part very strong across the board go for it watch it in the theater
Nov 1 2021,positive,absolutely loved all the actors chosen for this movie followed the book fairly closely an absolute must see
Nov 1 2021,positive,a quality depiction of the book with breathtaking visuals and excellent portrayals of interesting characters an instant mustsee for scifi fans
Nov 1 2021,positive,this movie is a perfect adaptation of the book amazing cast score cinematography and screenplay in some ways even better than the book imo
Nov 1 2021,positive,while clumsy with its worldbuilding dune combines sweepingly epic visuals with an agreeable pace viewers may not understand the lore of the dune universe after one viewing but they will leave entertained while still being able to have understood the key plot elements
Nov 1 2021,positive,never have read the books or seen the original dune films but a fan of scifi i was blown away by this film the story and the way this movie was shot is incredible this films universe is propably going to be my new favorite
Nov 1 2021,positive,the story was great loved the action and the dialogue the camera work is unbelievable the way they focused on the faces of the characters and blurred everything else was truly amazing there better be a part two for this series cause i wanna see more
Nov 1 2021,positive,denis villeneuve creates another banger this isnt my favorite of his films but its still fantastic my main issue with it though is that it is on the slower side and there is an emphasis on set up here but with the knowledge that its set up similarly to the lord of the rings films then it wasnt something i took a major issue with even if its a lot of set up its an engaging and investing set up besides a couple of scenes i was fully engaged with the story and characters throughout on a pure technical level this film is masterful the visual effects are off the charts all of the ships locations and animals feel incredibly realistic and whimsical the cinematography is fantastic i prefer the cinematography in blade runner 2049 but it was still amazing here every shot looks incredible with how its lit or the framing the performances were pretty great i wouldnt say this is the best performance from these actors with the exception of jason mamoa and rebecca ferguson both of them do a great job and im excited to see what else they can do hans zimmer once again puts out another banger score this is easily the better between this and no time to die but both are still great the character work definitely helps the set up feel engaging we dont get a lot of exposition dumps about our characters but we are shown how they act and its great i wouldnt put this at the top of a villeneuve ranking but its up there and i cant wait for the sequel definitely check this film out when you can its worth the price of admission
Nov 1 2021,positive,great great casting and looking forward to the next one
Nov 1 2021,positive,i believe dune is the star wars of this generation at least it feels like that way for me because i was in awe the entire time watching this movie i fell in love with every aspect of the world building and the deep complex intricate aspects of the universe this movie takes place in   a must watch if your a scifi fan
Nov 1 2021,positive,must watch in the movie theater to get the audio an visual effects 
Nov 1 2021,positive,held true to the book which is an action filled feudal epic without sacrificing character development  cant wait to see part ii  loved the fight scene between paul and the freeman  what that guy did snarling at him with his teeth chattering reminded me so much of what anthony hopkins did with his lips smacking over the thought of fava beansand somebody lol  spooky
Nov 1 2021,positive,cant wait for the next movie
Nov 1 2021,positive,excellent adaptation of the book a must watch
Nov 1 2021,positive,simply a beautiful movie  the soundtrack and special effects were outstanding  i have read the books there are some things they did really well but a few things i miss like the internal dialog of the characters and the more overarching politics including choam were missing the reason for and the repercussions of jessica having a son instead of the daughter she was ordered to have was also not really mentioned but maybe they will touch on that in the next movie   excellent movie all around
Nov 1 2021,positive,good but not great i really wanted it to be great but it was just average
Nov 1 2021,positive,dune must be experienced on the largest screen possible  the dune novels never made it into my hands so i might not be the target audience for this film i did try to enjoy the 1984 movie directed by david lynch but i couldnt finish it but i do like big scifi films which is what this movie is so if you plan to watch dune filmed with imax cameras i recommend finding the most giant screen your theater has to offer    dune is long and slow sitting at 2 hours and 35 minutes for movie lovers and dune fans the long runtime and drawn out story will not be a problem for the rest of you be ready to look at your watch for time to time i enjoyed the cinematic shots from beginning to end but knowing this movie is a drawn out part 1 of a planned multimovie franchise made it difficult to appreciate this movie for what is is an intelligent eerie and gorgeous scifi epic    surprisingly dune is not director denis villeneuves best film    his more notable movies are better than dune such as 2015s sicario and 2017s blade runner 2049 despite that villeneuve is an excellent filmmaker and has a great eye for this genre all the visuals were top tier and the special effects were seamless which will easily immerse moviegoers into the world of dune    the cast is brilliant which features timothée chalamet rebecca ferguson oscar isaac jason momoa stellan skarsgård josh brolin javier bardem dave bautista and zendaya after dunes debut chalamet who has already signed on to play willy wonka in the upcoming origins movie will be offered plenty of prominent roles unfortunately this movie is not filled with that much dialogue and at times this whispery dialogue is incoherent but the cast does give stellar performances with what they are handed with also seeing oscar isaac in his role as leto atreides has me super excited for his metal gear solid movie    verdict  i give dune a 75 out of 10 it is a scifi soap opera full of epic landscapes and intense action
Nov 1 2021,negative,godawful waste of time yes the cinematography is stunning but the dialogue is inane acting barely marginal costuming failed why does everyone good  bad guy all look the same it crawls along and not in a good way even worse the sound is just horrendous to the point that about half of the speaking roles cannot be understood it is all garbled and you miss a good part of the plot  if you havent read the book dont go to the movie you will be confused if you saw dune 1 dont go to this one very disappointing
Nov 1 2021,positive,great visuals with outstanding action scenes its worth the price of admission to see rebecca ferguson i liked this movie a lot
Nov 1 2021,neutral,boring boring boring
Nov 1 2021,negative,shit movie it was so boring i fell asleep and had to rewind it twice
Nov 1 2021,negative,almost walked out  too loud too violent uncomprhensable dialogue and scenario but brilliant cinematography
Nov 1 2021,positive,way more details revealed in this version the graphics were very realistic surpassed my expectations as a big dune fan
Nov 1 2021,positive,this was incredible  as someone who went in almost completely in the dark never h any exposure to the books or previous adaptations i was sucked into this world immediately  cant wait for part two
Nov 1 2021,positive,it was okay  kinda hard to follow  im gonna try to read the book now
Nov 1 2021,positive,it will never be the book  its just a great syfy
Nov 1 2021,positive,some great effects n storyline
Nov 1 2021,positive,good job of keeping to the original storyline i look forward to seeing part two
Nov 1 2021,positive,moaddim epic the omnithoptors were perfect brilliant effects  excellent casting  great adaptation of the stilsuits definitely looking for part deux
Nov 1 2021,positive,theres nothing special about it
Nov 1 2021,positive,a bit overly produced but good
Nov 1 2021,positive,entertaining but not that original drags along
Nov 1 2021,positive,could give a solid 5star review but i have not yet finished the book  still met my expectations looking forward to part 2
Nov 1 2021,positive,it was a really well done and super breathtaking liveaction science fiction adventure it had really fantastic special effects really well done cinematography really interesting characters really amazing music really superb cast really cool sets really great drama really exciting action really thrilling adventure and a really magnificent story i think its one of the best movies ive ever seen this year i really recommend this movie to scifi fans of all ages
Nov 1 2021,positive,great special effects acting was good it was too disjuncted for me
Nov 1 2021,positive,casting was great for the specific roles special effects were fun especially liked the dragon flight space shuttles  story line unfolded carefully so you could follow even if you hadnt read the book
Nov 1 2021,positive,everything about this movie is fantastic
Nov 1 2021,positive,was someone who watched the original dune so i think they did a great job following the original story of house atriedies and its path and i look forward to the second installment  when his voice becomes power and takes life
Nov 1 2021,positive,it was hard to follow and the movie is recorded so low people had trouble trying to understand some of the audio  there were several people in the audience and a few spoke up about both things when you cant understand what the actors are saying and the storyline is hard to follow give it up
Nov 1 2021,positive,i love the dune story and im so glad this movie does justice to dune i cant wait for the next one
Nov 1 2021,positive,this movie was so well done i was very impressed with how well the practical effects and cgi were blended together almost everything felt like it was crafted with care and there seemed to be no intent to become a cheap crowd pleaser the novel which ive never read from what i hear is very in depth and complicated to which most never thought it could be made into a movie its been attempted before but never done successfully as this its part one of what is going to be a two part movie although im hearing its possible there will be a part 3 
Nov 1 2021,positive,if you are not already a fan of the novels i would think you would find the movie dreary ponderous and long  if you are a fan of the novels you will probably like this movie
Nov 1 2021,negative,story was way too strung out in sad marketing attempt to profit off a second movie
Nov 1 2021,positive,see this on the biggest screen you can fantastic
Nov 1 2021,positive,wonderful adaptation of the book denis villeneuve is a director with a keen eye visually stunning and true to the book this movie delivers an emotional wallop  all the actors do a fine job but carlotte rampling commands the few scenes that shes in and her face is mostly covered oscar isaac displays the weight of his characters impending doom in his every expression rebecca ferguson shows the disconnect between the love for her son and her fealty to the bene gesserit and timothee chalamet is paul atreides    from the design of the ornithopters to the night battle on arrakis and the vast expanse of the desert the set design is spot on    a wonderful adventure all the way round
Nov 1 2021,positive,dune was visually stunning and a great cast of characters the main cast actually did really well to improve the cinematic experience however the movie just felt like a very long set up for its sequel not to mention it wasnt too exciting and the story felt overly complicated at times
Nov 1 2021,positive,fans of the book will see that many meaningful parts were cut out in favor of action and visuals which was really a shame because i know the director is said fan i think the acting was phenomenal and the artistic direction superb however i left the theater feeling just meh about it
Nov 1 2021,positive,strayed a little bit from book
Nov 1 2021,positive,epic this is an incredibly detailed and well crafted film i cant wait for part 2
Nov 1 2021,positive,denis villeneuve proves once again to be one of the best directors working today the  breathtaking cinematography combined with pitch perfect performances makes this movie a must see
Nov 1 2021,positive,gorgeous and full of incredible special effects its worth watching although slow to engage emotionally
Nov 1 2021,positive,couldnt believe how closely accurate it was to the book 
Nov 1 2021,positive,its a very emotional movie really beautiful scenary incredible actors amazing director  must see
Nov 1 2021,negative,visual effects were amazing but it was a snooze fest 
Nov 1 2021,positive,never a fan and wasnt expecting much but it was absolutely stunning blade runner meets 300 a visual and audio spectacle that only villeneuve and zimmer could make
Nov 1 2021,positive,this was maybe the most faithful book to screen adaptation ive ever seen they brought everything from the novel to life in a way that was familiar and yet utterly alien and enthralling the sound and visual design was exceptional i do wish they were less whispery with the dialogue but they didnt pull a nolan and have loud music playing over it as well so ill give it a pass there
Nov 1 2021,positive,realistic landscape and great special effects
Nov 1 2021,negative,i read the books years ago and loved them thats not the case for the film it is extremely slow moving and by the time you really understand it and are invested and engaged it ends now we wait for part two which i doubt ill bother seeing
Nov 1 2021,positive,a masterpiece builds a completely new complicated but still understandable world that i really do wish was 4 hours so relieved to hear a sequel is on the way great performances too  pray to god there is an extended cut that comes out with the rumored extra footage
Nov 1 2021,positive,great movie  special effects were on point and the story was really good  the acting was top notch  i cannot wait for part 2
Nov 1 2021,positive,the movie was everything i thought it would be and more great acting visual effects and casting if you are a fan of this scifi then must not miss this chapter
Nov 1 2021,positive,very close to the book denis is a genius
Nov 1 2021,positive,the movie felt like an epic on a grand scale
Nov 1 2021,positive,this movie is visually stunning and definitely worth seeing in the theater its a huge improvement from the 80s version i found the music a bit off putting at times because its so loud and distracting parts of it are a little slow but overall i would highly recommend it
Nov 1 2021,positive,well worth the big screen already excited for part 2
Nov 1 2021,positive,epic true as possible to the book with mindblowing visual effects casting is perfect
Oct 31 2021,positive,very enthralling and immersing sometimes a bit disorienting one big flaw i think is even though this time around theyre splitting the story into two films at least it still is too much content and the pace felt too quick just eventeventevent and when characters die etc you dont get a deep emotional response because you havent been able to attach or invest yourself much in them yet also i think they should have gone for a slower buildup with more mystery regarding the bene gesserit they kind of hammered and milked them way too hard
Oct 31 2021,positive,dune is visually astounding and the audio matches intensity is the name of the game for two and a half hours of screen time creating an exhausting though still enjoyable experience this film is emotionally compelling captures attention and makes one crave the promised sequel
Oct 31 2021,positive,visually it is a masterpiece  great acting great action
Oct 31 2021,negative,this is probably the most boring movie i have ever seen all i wanted was this movie to end
Oct 31 2021,positive,if you get the chance to see dune in theaters take it ive read the pacing could be quicker however considering the breadth of the story unfolding onscreen i disagree its the best movie ive seen in a couple of years but it is simply too extra for a tv screen and crummy little tv speakers this one deserves the big screen
Oct 31 2021,positive,dune is a triumph in all ways i cannot wait to see it again and i eagerly await the sequel
Oct 31 2021,positive,the closest thing to a faithful adaptation to the book or the first 1312  visuals are stunning  the plot is pretty tight  if you are familiar with the source material then you will recognize things being tweaked or rushed through which is understandable given how long the movie would actually be if they didnt condense things  one flaw i could give it is the worldbuilding is a bit light and the movie feels like its operating in a vacuum not a lot of exposition on how this universe operates outside of arrakis  should nab at least a few academy awards
Oct 31 2021,positive,some will like others wont hard to hear some dialogue and a little slow at some points its more of a build up to sequels i think hopefully more to come
Oct 31 2021,positive,much closer to the novel than the 1984 version excellent special effects loved the ornithopters
Oct 31 2021,positive,beat adaptation of the novel to date hope part 2 is as good
Oct 31 2021,positive,liked the people the way the movie followed the story the characters  i personally hate fighting in the dark always confusing and hard to follow darn near got killed by friendly fire one night and that explains that problem     dark and brooding flashbacks to dreams loud music drowning out thoughts  meh i could do with less of those  i felt that the bg mantras need to be brought forward more
Oct 31 2021,negative,absolute snooze fest no appreciation to the book just a half hearted arthouse attempt at updating lynchs attempt
Oct 31 2021,positive,frank herbert would be proud they finally got his vision right it was wonderful to see and hans zimmer did himself a wonderful job with the soundtrack no person could have done better im glad that they are doing it this way it is far far too complex a story to do in 2 hours and with such material so much material i hope we see a lot more in the future in this wonderful story
Oct 31 2021,negative,great visuals  audio put me off but it could have been the imax there was a disparity between sound and spoken script which made it unpleasant to listen to chalamets acting was a bit too stiff in my opinion ok for a tv experience for the fraction of the cost
Oct 31 2021,negative,total waste of time going to the theater should have watched at home will be going to theater for part 2
Oct 31 2021,positive,dinner followed the original movie near to the letter the cast is peppered with good actors i seen it in imax looking forward to chapter 2
Oct 31 2021,positive,its not for everyone but for me it was an amazing movie this needs to be watched in imax and on the biggest screen possible
Oct 31 2021,positive,it was a great follow up to the 1984 movie loved it
Oct 31 2021,positive,great movie well done  so much better than the 1984 version acting storyline pace of the movie all really well done
Oct 31 2021,positive,visually stunning overall i thought it was very well done but im glad i had familiarity with the storyline i could see how it might be confusing for people who havent read the book
Oct 31 2021,positive,amazing cinematography music and more full review on the joejoe show
Oct 31 2021,positive,extremely loyal to the book  was able to capture the political and religious nuances that the 1984 version couldnt  where there were liberties taken they were very well done and remained in the spirit of herberts vision
Oct 31 2021,negative,really slow moving and not very entertaining at all  better at the end but the first 2 hours were miserable to say least
Oct 31 2021,positive,visually spectacular incredible cast fantastic plot
Oct 31 2021,positive,ambitious undertaking that in my opinion fell very short  the visuals are great and in many cases stunning but that did not make up for a lackluster story  it is a good thing this is getting a sequel because the ending of this movie certainly left me feeling i watched all this to just get here  as someone well versed in the books i am not sure where a better ending would have been to allow for a sequel but i know when i got to the end of this movie i was very disappointed there is no real indication of the true destiny and power of paulmaudib  a few throwaway lines across the movie really do not bring the whole mysticism and religion aspect to life at least not for me
Oct 31 2021,positive,just wonderful so beautiful the score costumes set design amazing i think its time to reread dune again
Oct 31 2021,positive,it was well casted had a good pace top notch costume and most importantly it told herberts story
Oct 31 2021,positive,the acting sets and special effects were excellent  it was a bit difficult to hear what the actors were saying at times they mumbled it seemed  the plot is complex and i would suspect not easy to follow for anyone unfamiliar with the dune series  nevertheless it was well done if not a bit formulaic  ive seen this story before
Oct 31 2021,negative,very disappointing i dont think most of the plot or dialogue was intended to be intelligible or understandable by anyone not already well read in the story  plot needed explaining but too much of the dialogue muttered whispered soto voce  wth  similarly almost all of cinematography obscured in shadows and darkness with only slight lighting  i dont think there was 10 minutes of bright color in the entire long movie except maybe for fires and explosions  this is how most movies are made these days and i dont get it  saw it in 3d which wasnt worth it at amc orng 102021  then in feb 2022 news it gets 10 oscar noms so i went to seetry it again cuz i found it totally forgettable  saw it 2nd time at amc ornch 21422   so have rewritten this post  and downgraded my rating from 2 12 stars to just 2
Oct 31 2021,positive,i dont say anythingold movie was much better
Oct 31 2021,positive,amazing grandiose film epic in every way went in knowing only basic lore never saw the old film or read any books cannot wait to see where it goes from here
Oct 31 2021,positive,saw it four times on hbomax  nothingand i mean nothing compares to seeing it in imax  denis villeneuve has filmed the unfilmable and created a modern cinematic classic    mr herbert would be proud  bless the maker
Oct 31 2021,positive,first movie ive seen in theaters since 2019 it was amazing especially the music composed by hans zimmer if oh like action and little talking then this movie isnt for you however if you like movies that really build to something and give you the basics of the universe than i cant recommend this movie enough it ends rather abruptly but knowing there is a second movie on the way it makes the ending worth it
Oct 31 2021,positive,this movie is brilliant casting is amazing jason momoa is excellent as duncan idoho he is the sword master from ginaz i could sit and praise all the cast and crew im a huge dune fan ive read the 11 main books i might have a bit of bias p
Oct 31 2021,positive,beautiful the whole way through acting spectacular special effects are out of this world
Oct 31 2021,positive,fantastic from start to end gripping and atmospheric cant wait for part 2 dont wait for the dvd etc this is an awsome film made for the big screen experience
Oct 31 2021,positive,if you are in the mood for a deeper movie with a lot of substance this is for you if you want a marvelstyle movie experience skip it  this has more depth than lord of the rings and the story is faster paced  that being said it is an excellent adaptation of the book which is the best science fiction book ever written
Oct 31 2021,positive,everything about the movie is perfect
Oct 31 2021,positive,it was good i saw the first but dont remember anything about other than the fact that it was weird and had big ugly worms this one on the other hand was awesome visually stunning the plot and story was good enough to keep me engaged the whole time i dont say this often like rarely because im a one and done girl but id see this again
Oct 31 2021,positive,a very intense and surreal ride the acting was phenomenal and the pacing was well done it definitely feels like the first of three movies ready for the next one
Oct 31 2021,positive,dune is superb and every category cant wait for the second one to come out everything was superb five stars
Oct 31 2021,positive,one of the greatest movies ever made amazing awesome spectacular
Oct 31 2021,positive,i loved it so much better than 1980s  version  i hope to see the next one too
Oct 31 2021,positive,amazing on the epic scale i hoped for loved how they cast the characters especially timothy as paul atriedes appreciated the thoughtfulness of the music the costumes the cinematographysuch an improvement upon the original though i appreciated it as well my only disappointment was not having them reimagine and show space folding
Oct 31 2021,negative,horrible movie fell asleep in the middle of the day an hour into it soundtrack is horrendous and it is very boring
Oct 31 2021,positive,an apparently unpopular opinion  a light show without much depth flat and tasteless i have no feeling for the characters and despite the long runtime the story feels rushed theyve removed any mystery its not foreshadowing its telling you exactly whats going to happen which leaves no room for mystery curiosity nor surprise    i love dune by frank herbert  i love the dune 1984 2hr  4hr versions despite the divergence from the novels  i really liked the dune tv miniseries from 2000 that i feel was the most accurate on screen portrayal of dune to date  i have been a dune fanboy for over 25 years    this on screen adaptation is being made as two or more movies with the first one being just over two and a half hours long a decently long movie and yet feels very rushed they overexplain things that are left to be mysterious in the book and other movies and under explain a lot of the things i feel are fun and interesting from the book and other movies    the visual effects are very good but what id expect with modern cgi technology    i feel like this is a dune made for people who enjoy the transformer movies more than people who enjoy dune    however based on the reviews i see that mine is an unpopular opinion
Oct 31 2021,positive,well done lots of action not a whole lot of acting for 2 12 hours zendaya didnt have a line until last 12 hour couldnt hear some of the dialogue because the music and sound effects were too loud
Oct 31 2021,positive,a film best enjoyed at a imax and given your full attention its a long film but doesnt seem soggy in the middle and its refreshing for a film to be set up as a first in a 2 part story probably not a film for anyone with a short span of attention looking forward to the next installment
Oct 31 2021,positive,really exceptional embodiment of the first half of the book  the best movie i have seen in several years   casting screenplay action sequences dialogue etc  its all remarkably well done
Oct 31 2021,positive,the movie very accurately recreated the scenes and technology of the book  the characters were perfectly recreated  the casting was on target  i was on the edge of my seat all the time  the only draw back is that the full richness of the book is really impossible to capture in a three hour movie so some things had to be left out  i knew that going into the movie
Oct 31 2021,positive,while its fair to consider it only half a movie it is well worth watching if only to enjoy the stunning visuals great performances from its perfectly casted actors brings enough heart to the characters while successfully building its massive world it should satisfy the majority of longtime book fans while being easily consumable for newcomers to the dune world as well if they can land the second film it has the potential of becoming one of the great all time scifi movie franchises
Oct 31 2021,positive,it was good and left you wanting more
Oct 31 2021,positive,excellent sound and action did not provide as much info but since that was what everyone bitched about with the first movie then here is your dumbeddown version still very good for those of us who know the story and the background well worth seeing if you are in the know
Oct 31 2021,positive,this was everything i wanted i didnt know much of anything about this universe and mr villeneuve has made yet another stunning movie i cannot wait to drive into this universe again and again 
Oct 31 2021,positive,interesting story incredible visuals sound and music this should be seen in movie theaters to fully appreciate the craft exhibited by the filmmakers
Oct 31 2021,positive,first of all this is a visual feast from the sands of arrakis to the clothing and armor and the architecture  i think it honors frank herberts vision and captured the flavor of his story  and for me the sign of a movie i really enjoyed is that i cant stop thinking about it  well done
Oct 31 2021,positive,i had never heard of dune before this past week when some friends who read the books wanted to go see it in theaters after seeing it i can say that i loved it and wish as many people as possible will go see it so that this can kick off a new big movie franchise would recommend watching the 80s film listening to an audio book reading the books or talking to friends about what the setting is if possible i did find that watching the old film helped me to better understand going in to this new one as someone who was unfamiliar to the story it can be a bit confusing at first as there are many nontypical wordsnames to remember
Oct 31 2021,positive,truly gripping throughout fantastic storyline characters videography music the whole package
Oct 31 2021,positive,absolutely awesome looking forward to sequel
Oct 31 2021,positive,not sure what we were expecting but it was hard to follow and the run time way too long however the acting and special effects were great 35
Oct 31 2021,positive,best presentation of dune yet casting was excellent soundtrack appropriate  worldscaping amazing i have a few nitpicks about the directing but overall very very good
Oct 31 2021,positive,of course it would be better with part two  should have been a long movie with an interlude  but as it is it was an amazing experience even though i already know the story inside and out    part two will probably need to be 3 hours long to capture it all
Oct 31 2021,positive,though i havent read the book i can see why it is so popular this film has amazing visuals a wonderful cast and great world building my only complaint is how abruptly the movie ends i know they are setting up a sequel but it leaves us slightly unsatisfied nevertheless this movie is probably tied for my favorite film of the year shangchi being up there too
Oct 31 2021,positive,visually breathtaking and substantially richer in plot than original movie dune gives example of great craftsmanship from director and better delivering actors than lynchs version it lacks a little bit to be called masterpiece but guarantees great time spent in front of screen
Oct 31 2021,negative,this is the baddest movie ive watched in the last few years i wish can claim the refund of my money 
Oct 31 2021,positive,it was an audio and visual masterpiece the film does a phenomenal job with depicting not only the highly advanced technology ships weapons etc but also arrakis and the more subtle cultural features that are specific to the fremen as someone whose read the book series it is my opinion that pauls prophetic and prodigious abilities were understated separately i think the average moviegoer expected chani zendaya to have a bigger role although i understand chanis role in the grand scheme of things and am sure the next film in the series will feature chani greatly i would agree that it is misleading for this film
Oct 31 2021,positive,loved the story and performances the production design is amazing really looking forward to the sequel
Oct 31 2021,positive,tonally not matched well compared to dolby digital version visually it was great
Oct 31 2021,positive,finally a space epic that actually feels epic its got a lordoftheringsinspace vibe but a little darker and with less direction the set pieces are awesome even though we dont get to spend a lot of time off arrakis every planet feels like it has its own unique climate ecosystem and culture its also got really good effects to the point where i couldnt tell when theyre cgi and when theyre practical massive objects really feel massive and the storms and caverns of arrakis are terrifying while feeling natural the unique score really feels menacing and alien adding some ominous tones and mystery    now theres something you need to know going into this movie which i wish i had known  its only part one of at least one more movie dont worry this isnt a spoiler its got part one in the opening credits my expectations were off given the marketing of this movie which never mentioned that this was only the first installment for one thing the movie feels a little directionless at times although its hard to judge until the series is finished also zendaya is barely in this movie at all    timothee chalamet is really good  he portrays a reckless young adult reluctant to the familys royalty while also playing on chosenone tropes the rest of the cast is honestly great as well although jason mamoa sometimes feels like hes just having fun more than actually participating in the movie    it doesnt beg for comparisons to the 1984 original thankfully but if one were to compare such as i am doing it would be no contest that 2021s is miles ahead i was particularly impressed with how well it teaches information on intricate plots effectively and without feeling forced this film also takes some relatively uninteresting characters plotwise and makes them much more menacing and engaging dune is a scifi fantasy epic that with the right expectations will be extremely enjoyable for fans of the cult classic as well as newcomers to the material
Oct 31 2021,positive,great visuals and storytelling despite dialogs getting washed out by ridiculously loud music
Oct 31 2021,positive,best movie this year so far
Oct 31 2021,positive,loved the movie  it was all i had hoped for and envisioned from reading the books  the sets cast and costumes were perfect   i will go back to see in 3d  i dont normally rave about s movie  but this did not disappoint
Oct 31 2021,negative,so limp no wow terrible editing to seem like lots of bits missingboringly interesting wanting something more to be said or happening even a good music score sadly i felt i wasted my money lead male just not believable too often gentle talking that also was weak cant think of any real good things to say
Oct 31 2021,positive,this was great adaptation of frank herberts dune visually stunning this is a tough movie to portray on screen due to the magnitude of trying to explain the universe to people new to dune and moving the story forward at a pace that doesnt bog down i feel they were successful my wife knew nothing of dune and not a scifi fan and she thoroughly enjoyed the movie thrilled to see they did not attempt to do this with one movie theres way too much to cover cant wait for the sequel
Oct 31 2021,positive,story line is very interesting special effects were nicely done
Oct 31 2021,positive,i enjoyed the movie with my family the sound system was turned so low though i couldnt hear much of it thankfully the acting was good enough i could tell what was going on
Oct 31 2021,positive,its a good adaptation of the story hitting most of the major points at a pace that doesnt feel rushed a bit too meandering in some areas hard to understand and hear speeches and slow to get from set piece to set piece but in a lot ways that helps sell the grandeur definitely looks really close to what i imagined when reading the book if youve enjoyed most tentpole science fiction of the last 50 years dune is probably a huge reason why i highly recommend this movie but do be prepared to wish you had a fast forward button and subtitles     if you have a short attention span or just want action pass on this if you enjoy space operas and interstellar politics give it a watch
Oct 31 2021,positive,i wonderful adaptation of frank herberts masterpiece dune 2021 captivates audiences and leaves you on the edge of your seat a movie which is as true as one can be to its source material dune is a must see for anyone who loved the novel and desires more see it in imax
Oct 31 2021,positive,25 hours is not enough to present incredible action story and of course the visual hope the 2nd part comes more spectacular
Oct 31 2021,positive,ive read all the books and even some of the brian herbert prequels so im a big dune fanboy and this film delivered beyond my expectations last night i watched dune at a drivein theatre and the scenes shot in neardarkness especially in the desert at the end looked so cool projected against the night sky the cinematographers use of darkness and sandstorms punctuated by barely visible robed figures is right out of the iconic book covers this is a movie i immediately wanted to watch again on the big screen and i dont think streaming it on tv would be as good
Oct 31 2021,positive,greatest scifi movie of our time
Oct 31 2021,positive,loved the movie  visually stunning  helps to be familiar with the book
Oct 31 2021,positive,this movie was exceptional the worldbuilding acting plot cgi and execution was amazing highly recommend one that will keep you on the edge of your seat and hungry for more
Oct 31 2021,positive,surely denis surpassed himself no wonder he keeps praising nolan
Oct 31 2021,positive,loved it the visuals the plot the closer it is to a really complicated novella i thought being a 2 parter was going to be a letdown but no this movie doesnt feel bloated nor slow
Oct 31 2021,positive,villeneuve never disappoints visuals and sound are phenomenal world building and storytelling is on point cant wait for the second half
Oct 31 2021,positive,on the plus side this version is more faithful to the book than the 80s film on the down side you need to have read the book or at least seen the other version to follow most of whats going on here this film doesnt fall into the trap of its predecessor of trying to cram an entire bricksized book into a 3hour run time choosing instead to splint the story into two parts but what you have in part 1 at least is a very dragass 165 minutes the battle scenes are pretty much hohum we dont really care when people live or die you do get the sense that a lot more action awaits in part 2 which would be terrific unfortunately i left the theater not caring if i see the second half of this story in the theater or while streaming at home
Oct 31 2021,negative,maybe it was hard to understand
Oct 31 2021,positive,astounding effects gorgeous cinematography great cast good pacing cant wait for part 2
Oct 31 2021,positive,great cinematics it really did feel like the year 10000 i also liked how it seemed far more accurate to the book
Oct 31 2021,positive,i had been anticipating villeneuves adaptation of dune for quite some time but after seeing it it mainly went to show me that when stripped of herberts wordy prose dune as a story is fairly formulaic and unsurprising    im glad the movie didnt stray far from the source material but like lynchs film before it this new dune movie also fails to understand the real protagonist should be the planet itself and ended up feeling mostly like a shoddily connected highlight reel missing all of the emotion from the books rather than a true rendition of what i read in those pages all this time ago   the dull lighting direction and muted colors certainly didnt help either     on the other hand the costume design is great and there are some beautiful shots in there it also takes its time to remind us that yes under this soulless exterior is still a villeneuve film
Oct 31 2021,positive,phenomenal storyline with great drama and interspliced action scenes they spent a lot of time in the movie developing the characters cant wait for the next in the series
Oct 31 2021,negative,boring and drawn out
Oct 31 2021,negative,terribly slow and boring wouldnt recommend to waste 25 hours of your time
Oct 31 2021,negative,long film where nothing much happens i did fall asleep briefly but i dont think this detracted form my experience by the tme i had worked out what and why things were going on i decided i didnt really care anymore so just looked at the picturesvisually great but not much more left the cinema feeling cheated with a numb bum and wish ing i had gone to see james bond
Oct 31 2021,positive,disappointed it was in parts part 1 was good but a little long
Oct 31 2021,positive,there is no comparison to the first film from the eighties that attempted to present the entire book this version was very true to the book didnt try to cover the whole book meaning probably two more sequels was superbly cast and acted the special effects were incredible did a great job delving into the politics and religious mystique in which the book was steeped it leaves plenty of room for the next film which i would imagine explores paul atreides and his mothers and notyetborn sibling no spoilers relationship and assimilation into fremen life and society it was in a word expansive i highly highly recommend
Oct 31 2021,positive,did not want the movie to be over
Oct 31 2021,negative,too long plot was boring
Oct 31 2021,positive,there is no question this is an epic visually stunning film even if it is mostly desert scenes however i kept waiting and waiting and waiting for the story plot to develop anyone that has seen the original dune movie will be disappointed there is a lot of wasted time this was such an obvious teasers movie that when it ended my first reaction was are you kinding me thats it i felt cheated by nice visuals that dont really add to the development of the story line if you start with the second moive youll say yourself a couple of hours of wasted time the first movie meet the characters get an idea of the issues see some great visuals kill off most main actors boy meets girl movie over
Oct 31 2021,negative,we could not hear the actors clearly walked out after 45 min   disappointed
Oct 31 2021,positive,musically amazing good story jason mamoas best on screen performance sorry if i slaughtered the spelling to his last name 
Oct 31 2021,positive,story line was fairly clear and followed a logical sequence to an appropriate break in the movie where circumstances and events would enter a new era  special effects were good although i agree with other critics that the sand worm lacked aweinspiring fear effect  good choice of actors for the characters they portrayed  although i understand the epic nature of the book requires multiple episodes of the movie to complete the story it still detracts from the sense of satisfaction of reaching a believable climax  even though herbert continued the story line in succeeding books dune is powerful enough to stand on its own  yet we have not achieved that yet
Oct 31 2021,positive,fresh and new  excited to watch the coming movies it was refreshing
Oct 31 2021,positive,everything i expected in a movie portraying this literary gem ready for part 2
Oct 31 2021,negative,this film is one of the most confusing monotone boring films i believe i will ever watch in my life 90 of the entire showing is just desert shots with taliban music over it i was surprised to see there were multiple songs used in this film zendaya does her shit acting once again the voice as they call it is unexplained and therefore makes zero sense they use old weapons even though its 2050 or something just a straight up boring and poorly executed film please dont bring us a sequel
Oct 31 2021,positive,i liked the setting i liked the pace i liked the scenery i liked the acting just a solid watch overall bring on part 2
Oct 31 2021,negative,movie is confusing and strung along plot overall waste of a high budgeted movie
Oct 31 2021,positive,if you havent read frank herberts 1965 cult novel or know about david lynchs messy movie adaptation in 1984 you might wonder whats the fuss about when watching denis villeneuves 2021 version which makes it look so simple and effortless much of that is down to an elegant and coherent screenplay which manages to update and streamline the sometimes antiquated and immensely dense plot of the source material into something more palatable and uncluttered set in a futuristicfeudal world where a machiavellian plot against the noble house of atreides plays out on the brutally arid planet of arrakis where a valuable substance nicknamed spice is mined this scifi soap opera can feel familiar but thats only because it has been borrowed by so many others since then villeneuves film defines the word spectacle with its majestic and sweeping cinematography wisely shot on location and aweinspiring special effects which allow herberts imagination to come alive on screen hans zimmers arabiantinged score which creates an immersive otherworldly aural experience and the films stunning production and costume designs further invoke and accentuate the islamic culture and the middle eastern allegory that permeate throughout herberts book amongst a huge ensemble of mostly mcudc movies alumnus led by timothee chalamet its rebecca fergusons and oscar issacs layered performances as the duke and his concubine that stand out most for me astutely splitting the novel into two films this first part has a lot of worldbuilding and exposition to get through the fact that villeneuve manages to do that with such grace and style all the while keeping its pacing tight and its momentum going so well that the films 2h35m duration literally flew by demonstrate unequivocally what an astounding achievement this is part two cannot come soon enough as far as im concerned
Oct 31 2021,positive,rarely has a book adaptation been so brilliantly and spectacularly made the transition to the big screen a mustsee
Oct 31 2021,positive,i can honeslty say its been a while since ive gone to the cinema and seen such a fantastic masterpiece of science fiction  frank herbert would be proud kowing his far superior science fitcion noval has been revitalized
Oct 31 2021,positive,one of the most immersive experiences ive ever had in a cinema and everything a post game of thrones audience should hope to see much like the frank herbert novel the world of dune is easy to admire and hard to love it undoubtedly lacks the warmth and wit of tolkiens middleearth and like lotr dune should and will be held up as a benchmark for the genre going forward
Oct 31 2021,positive,loved this movie the actors performances were captivating and the story kept me glued to my seat
Oct 31 2021,positive,well done hope they stay consistent
Oct 31 2021,positive,i didnt love all the casting but the added parts from the book made up for it and then some
Oct 31 2021,positive,stunning naturalistic take the dune universe is complex and multilayered and other interpretations have struggled with trying to explain everything  the choice here to explain nothing except where absolutely needed and simply let the story flow was inspired     what weakness there are really stem from the source material  it feels like a prelude to much larger story which is what it is that becomes a challenge in a two part film  it is one episode told over two films that is itself a a jumping off point to even larger mythology  you are welded mostly to pauls pov and thus intriguing threads and side characters are not explored beyond what is minimally needed to advance the plot  it is theage old challenge of focusing on plot vscharacter development you could adapt this as a ten hour series and lose no details but you would sacrifice the grandeur and scale of a theatrical release that delivers maximum impact      it clocks in at 2 hours and 45 minutes already choices have to be made and they go with keeping the focus on the main protagonist  if part two maintains the quality of part one i think history will judge this the right choice
Oct 31 2021,positive,realy nice music and the story allmost follows the books but some parts in books who is only 1page is 30min in the film and other parts in books are to short in the movie that i think need more time  cant wait for next part and the part after that if they keep up 
Oct 31 2021,positive,amazing better than i expected
Oct 31 2021,positive,first off the audio producer needs to be fired  the music was obnoxious and ruined half of the good scenes  they should have just used grimes geidi primes album would have worked much better and most of the work would already be done  the usage of the the voice was done in an excessively intense audio distortion       im a big fan of the books and even lynchs film so i had high hopes for this especially when i heard they were going to put it in 2 parts  i figured that meant they werent going to skimp on painting frank herberts brilliant vision but they did baron harkonnen lacks all of his dialogue that paints the picture of a cold yet wise and calculating villiain with a different view of the world from the protagonist  they completely left out feyd rautha  the heir to the throne who is supposed to be the one paul the protagonist fights in a duel to the death in the end of the book   they did such a poor job of illustrating who the enemy is that they just come off as generic spooky evil people     the acting was good enough although lady jessica is supposed to be enrapturingly beautiful and rebecca ferguson is not ugly by any means but not really jessica material the fight scenes were choreographed well      the movie ending is pretty terrible no real spoilers here  its very abrupt and is quite the anticlimax not to mention all the fremen walking on the surface during the day without their stillsuit masks on  fremen heavily look down on people with poor water discipline  and that would be kinda acceptable if it werent for the fact that it starts blasting the psychotic wails of an anguished woman in an overproduced fake hollywood audio quality  cut scene the end
Oct 31 2021,positive,i did enjoy watching dune did not understand every scene all in all it was a very good sciencefiction film a modern one compared to the 80s dune i really enjoyed it was very relaxing in the seats that goal like recliners thank you very much cant wait for part two hope its not a whole year in the making
Oct 31 2021,positive,ambitious beautiful to watch especially in imax sound design and score are otherworldly one of the best scifi movies in recent years
Oct 31 2021,positive,i consider myself a dune superfan so i am somewhat biased     this is an incredibly difficult book to adapt for the screen but they did a fantastic job i read the first book again last week to prepare for this movie and found it to track the book very closely they had to gloss over some stuff and omit a couple of scenes from the book  such as the dinner scene at letos house on arakis  but the acting is terrific and the shots themselves are absolutely fantastic i was plesently surprised to find that denis villeneuve did not rely on a lot of vfxcgi to carry this film beautiful sets and costumes instead
Oct 31 2021,positive,i grew up reading dune around the time of the syfy miniseries which i adored  so this movie had a lot to live up to in my eyes  and largely it did  the visuals are amazing the music is really good and most of the plot is rather faithful  i do wish theyd kept in more of the islamic influences though  on the universe and especially the fremen  they seem to have scrubbed a lot of it and gone with more generic stuff  i mean sure jihad i get removing that given the audience and the association america has with the term but theres a lot more that feels removedsanded down that didnt need to be  if almost feels like they kept it out for fear of offending by including it    but other than that excellent casting great acting and overall a very good movie  cant wait for the next and hopefully a third
Oct 31 2021,positive,the actions scenes were amazing i just feel it could have moved along a little faster
Oct 31 2021,negative,i cannot understand why this movie is still rated that high it is boring it is too long for the part of the story it tells it ends in the middle of the story it left me very disappointed i give it a star for the score and some of the special effects
Oct 31 2021,positive,absolutely stunning a visual masterpiece and a fantastic cast cant wait for part 2 
Oct 31 2021,positive,epic recreation of a world imagined in my youth so often movies that depict a favorite book are disappointing this was beautifully crafted and told and more than satisfied saw with my sons and grandson we all wanted part 2 asap very glad we saw on imax ill also be watching on hbo max
Oct 31 2021,positive,great job of following the book great movie
Oct 31 2021,positive,loved it glad we saw it on the big screen
Oct 31 2021,positive,great movie we didnt read the book but still caught onto the story looking forward to the additional parts
Oct 31 2021,positive,great go see it in the theatre its worth it
Oct 31 2021,positive,okay so here is the dealio    this movie is very slow but does pick up after a bit im not into slow movies so that part wasnt my cup of tea but the reason im giving this 5 stars is because even though the movie was slow the graphics were amazing and my boyfriend who had read the dune book and an adorkable nerd absolutely loved it    he told me that it really went off of the books and they did a really amazing job on the movie ive never read the books so im going to trust him on this one    oh uh word of warning though  dont expect everything from the trailers to be in the movie
Oct 31 2021,positive,the movie was absolutely amazing the action sequences the characters all great my only complaints are i wish we had more time with the atreides before everything went down something about that whole scene just didnt feel right to me everything else was great though spectacular film
Oct 31 2021,positive,the trailers and reviews dont really do this justice this is worth enduring the annoyances of visiting a theater in the modern area to see this on a big screen and hear this with big speakers
Oct 31 2021,positive,literally this movie series has infinite potential world class book writing with amazing music acting and most importantly a director with a vision for the future this will be the next trilogy to stand the test of time
Oct 31 2021,positive,i liked the sound the plot build and cant wait for part two
Oct 31 2021,neutral,the best i can say about it is the visuals are beautiful the soundmusic was powerful and omni present the story not so much unless you know the book or the long cut of the 1984 movie you will not understand much in this movie and since this is a well known book and movie spoilers are not really a problem in fact the woman who had the seat next to had her friend that was sitting behind her come forward about half way tell her she doesnt understand this at all and wanted to leave they both left i have never seen anyone leave a theater before the actors in the 1984 had presence and you understood who they were and why the were there part of that was the narration and part of it was in movie explanation these actors except for the baron and the beast really lacked any presence the actress who was jessica seemed so weak while the mother superior was interviewing paul i absolutely did not believe that she could stop anyone from coming into save him from the box there are several story continuity issues that just make you keep asking what happened to this item or that item that they were given and now need normally i stay to watch the credits to enjoy the music and to honor the work of the cast and crew i just couldnt stand listening to it without the movie itself so i left before the credits finished and saw that i was the last to leave at least the theater was mostly sold out
Oct 31 2021,positive,although only part 1 dune held to the books original storyline  a little more development of some of the earlier characters in house atreides but overall very good
Oct 31 2021,positive,i have read the book so my experience may be different than others i thought the movie was beautiful to look at and visually visually amazing the story stayed true to the book more so than the previous efforts that have been done   the choice of actors was outstanding  i partucularly enjoyed jason mamoa as duncan idaho and stellan skarsgard as the baron  but timothee chalomet and josh brolin were brilliant also  this version of dune is on par with star wars great scifi story driven by interesting characters
Oct 31 2021,negative,genuinely terrible confusing boring underdeveloped last time i wanted to walk out of the theater because of how bad the movie is was birds of prey
Oct 31 2021,positive,i didnt read the books but my husband did we both thought is was awsome
Oct 31 2021,negative,too long and confusing
Oct 31 2021,positive,dune is a very difficult story to put in film if you know the story this is a fantastic cinematic depiction if you dont know the story the film will likely not move you
Oct 31 2021,positive,remake was well done cant wait for the next part
Oct 31 2021,positive,the story acting cinematography music  everything  was topnotch and very enjoyable  highest recommendations
Oct 31 2021,positive,the word that keeps coming to kind with this movie  epic was glued to the screen plot could be confusing but not impossible to follow if i had to choose some things  a little too many slow motion shots with intense music also some of jessica and pauls dialogue can be hard to hear
Oct 31 2021,positive,immersive and hits the ground running no warm up no intro voice over or opening crawl as to wtf has been going on for decades and decades rather the devil is in the details visual and auditory storytelling to be concrete villaneuve does it again its not the same calibre as 2049 but its quite excellent  timothee shines rebecca is a force to be reckoned with supporting characters got their close up but this is a timotheespauls story to begin with
Oct 31 2021,positive,loved everything about it  the score cinematography acting storyline
Oct 31 2021,positive,seeing the original i was surprised how the storyline changed and abruptly end
Oct 31 2021,positive,amazing story amazing graphics amazing cast loved it
Oct 31 2021,positive,it was hard to enjoy the movie because a group people were being really loud and running up and down the stairs throughout the whole movie so its hard to say that we enjoyed something that we didnt get to fully watch the staff was really friendly and did a good job serving everyone
Oct 31 2021,neutral,visually awesome and had its moments but felt like i was waiting forever for the movie to start 
Oct 31 2021,positive,considering the depth of the universe frank herbert crafted the movie did a phenomenal job of conveying as much information as possible without too much clunky exposition beautiful cinematography visceral sound design dazzling sfx the whole experience was unbelievable
Oct 31 2021,positive,great actors intriguing storyline a little dark
Oct 31 2021,positive,great movie cant wait for part 2
Oct 31 2021,negative,couldnt understand most of the dialogue or the plot good special effects
Oct 31 2021,positive,it was slow moving at times cant wait for part 2
Oct 31 2021,positive,absolutely fantastic movie
Oct 31 2021,positive,true to the book great visuals and cinematography   great acting
Oct 31 2021,positive,fantastic movie tough story line to unfold but this one nailed it well worth seeing on the big screen cant wait for part two
Oct 31 2021,negative,it was horrible the plot moved at a snails pace
Oct 31 2021,positive,amazing visual and sound effects
Oct 31 2021,positive,a movie that delivers in scale what a theater experience should production costume art direction is gorgeous this movie is truly to be experienced on the big screen and though not always a fan of imax this film is optimal in that format the other worldliness incredible detail sound composition is truly beautiful great cast and of course timothee chalamet though young is talented enough to pull through an emotional thread and conflict in this characters rite of passage
Oct 31 2021,positive,i didnt know almost anything about the book the movie alone was enough to awaken my sense of wonder one of the best experiences ive had in cinema cant wait for part 2
Oct 31 2021,positive,this is one of those films where if you havent read the book the story might be confusing so in this regard the film fails to stand on its own i should not have to read the book first to fully understand what is going on in the movie the main character as well as most of the characters in the film are very plain and lacking in depth but that is also an issue with the book as well the visuals and sound are the only good thing about this film and the only reason why i will rank it slightly above average
Oct 31 2021,negative,worst confusing and mean less plot of any movie i ever seen waste of time and money
Oct 31 2021,positive,the soundtrack is absolutely incredible and the entire feel of the movie is grand and ominous which perfectly suits the story
Oct 31 2021,positive,the magic of movie is when it drag you like a book you open dune is filming at is best perfect mix or film dauteur and entertainement movie the image is stunnig  bravo greig fraser the sound track is hypnotic  the vfx paul lambert are so real its a tour de force and denis villeneuve did a amazing job by doing an impossible story and have all actors good  bravo  you watch the movie you go to bed and you will dream about it for a few days go see it in a theater  it a must
Oct 31 2021,positive,it was like a memory
Oct 31 2021,positive,music was unnecessarily loud in some scenes
Oct 31 2021,positive,good movie slow moving but rightfully so would watch again looking forward to part 2
Oct 31 2021,negative,the movie was painfully long  boring it felt like a basic story that was dragged out
Oct 31 2021,positive,absolutely breathtaking definitely not a mindless action flick though
Oct 31 2021,negative,didnt like the overall story but the special effects were great
Oct 31 2021,positive,wasnt aware it was two parts  thought it needed more narration for the setup like the first one did
Oct 31 2021,positive,great movie but youre going to have to listen to the story this isnt a marvel or a michael bay movie lol as a fan of the books and the 80s movie it was very enjoyable i even saw a few nods at the videogames the pacing and movie length couldve been improved by removing some of the visual moments pauls visions eventually become annoying there are too many of them other than that i cant wait for the next part
Oct 31 2021,neutral,too long too hard to follow had some cool moments tho
Oct 31 2021,positive,it kept true to the book and the acting was fantastic a few minor things left out or changed but overall it was such a good adaptation
Oct 31 2021,positive,i found the story line interesting and entertaining i also liked that the movie reminded me of star wars i enjoyed the part that jason mamoa played and liked all of the other actors in the movie as well  i am looking forward to the next movie in the series
Oct 31 2021,positive,very friggin cool go see it in theatre
Oct 31 2021,negative,disappointing doesnt compare to book or lynch film gray film with pallid actors  it was filmed partly in  liwa oasis which ive visted and partly in jordan in liwa the uae oman and egypts western dsert where ive spent a total of 8 weeks where the sky was bright blue during the four years when i taught arabic speaking students in the desert country of qatar the sky was blue 95 of the time except during the rare sandstorm or dustorm in this film the sky is always hazy and the light dim and gray the first fremen to visit duke atriedes walks in disrespectfully and is terse and rude generally espec in formal occasions arabicspeaking people are restrained polite and courteous the fremen here act like some mongrel gang in nyc la or any early star trek episode not the selfpossesed people of the book in the lynch film baron harkonnen is dramatically evil and  grotesque as he pulls the plug from the chest to make his catamite die and his son is also recognizable dreadful the continually stoned navigator in his bubble is also striking and very alien and shows the reason for spice and also tells us were in a verry different world no navigator here sting is striking and unfortunately has given the world a new style of unnecessary emphasis with his i will kill him even though nobody said otherwise in the 2021 version the harkonnen son is like some bitpart braindamaged thug and the floating baron has little personality the lynch film is reputed to be too hard to follow for its complex plot well not here far too much time is taken up in crowd shots of unrecognizable people kniving and hitting each other by the dragonfly shaped helicopter flying up and down and sideways in graybrown sand and by enormous metal boxes landing or taken off in yet more dust with a few flames thrown in gurney halek and duncan have little personality mostly expressed in the kinds of male hugs seen far more often in movies rarely seen in real lfe i dont care when they get killed because i dont care action sequences are just there to have action sequences paul gets in a knife fight with a thuggish fremen the yg fmale fremen sneers at him paul wins and suddenly hes a fremen and one of the gang  paul absorbs the fremen philosophy as he hears phrases that are variations on go with the flow and other pop psychology phrases that frank herbert wouldnt have let him self put on paper the actor playing the mother jessica seemed colourless and pallid her complexion not helped by the grim lighting the best parts were retained from the book the command voices were well done the hunter seeked at least appeared although its menace was underdone and its good they retained the poison tooth sequence and those involving the doctor overall little wonder the theatre where i saw it was mostly empty generally i respect rotten tomatoes top critics but i dont get why they overall gave an 80 plus rating to this and rating in the 40s  for lynchs film which i am now going to watch again
Oct 31 2021,positive,great movie already looking forward to part 2
Oct 31 2021,positive,wow excellent movie cannot wait until part 2 arrives
Oct 31 2021,positive,boring beginning  better towards the end
Oct 31 2021,positive,the movie was a little hard to follow great special effects not enough character development
Oct 31 2021,positive,the director acting and the films cinematography make the film tc is this generations olivier the imax experience doesnt hurt either
Oct 31 2021,positive,definitely hard to follow initially but near the end you can see the makings of the next big cinematic blockbuster
Oct 31 2021,positive,great movie cant wait for part two
Oct 31 2021,positive,incredible cinematography and soundmusic loved how the story was envisioned
Oct 31 2021,positive,big film  big screen big success i became immersed within the first three minutes  its a grand attempt to capture the book and it succeeds in many ways especially the cinematography
Oct 31 2021,positive,its rare that a blockbuster has something to say the nature of dreams and destiny and how we forge our path good stuff
Oct 31 2021,negative,one of the worst movies i have ever seen how does hundreds of ship invade with out an advance civilization ever knowing they drag out every scene do not waste your money i wouldve walked out the theater if i hadnt paid for it already
Oct 31 2021,positive,stunning you do not want to miss watching this in the theaters i watched it on hbo max first and then in imax and it was like seeing it for the first time
Oct 31 2021,positive,the movie takes time to cover the background but not boring about it looking forward to part 2
Oct 31 2021,negative,what a waste of my time
Oct 31 2021,positive,best movie in nearly a decade the music the sounds the visuals were absolutely amazing  the actors knocked it out of the park they stuck really close to the source material  my kids were hesitant to see the movie but the loved talking about it on the way home and asking a ton of questions  i cant wait to see part two
Oct 31 2021,positive,good movie id give it 45 but was annoyed by the hype around zendya
Oct 31 2021,positive,loved ittrue to the book those sandworms were awesome
Oct 31 2021,positive,dune part 1  2021 currently in theaters and on hbo max  it is yet another attempt to capture frank herberts epic tale of spice messiahs and treachery on the screen  it a massive improvement on david lynchs 1984 effort and obviously vastly better than the tv miniseries from 2001 but it is only a little more than half the book with about twenty minutes at the start from prequel novels and just explanation of some of the background and characters  its worth a trip to the theaters if you have any interest in it but it will be hard to judge the film until the 2nd half is made  as it is its a 4 star movie with the chance of being 4 ½ if the 2nd part lands with the same impact   my two biggest beefs are timothée chalamet who i have never found appealing acting wiséhe seems like an angry stonier in every film but that works for this film and the weird portrayals of the villains who are supposed to be smart and crafty but always seem more brutal buffoons in fairness to the movie that is also true in the book  i am given the film a pass on failing to explain many of the weirdness that does have explanations the swords mentats folding space the loss of most of the time on dune by our main charactrsas it manages to work without fully revealing all of them and at 2 and half hours it had to make some cuts  but if you dont like space operathis is unlikely to change your mind
Oct 31 2021,positive,its not a movie its an experience highly imersive this artistic scifi will become a cult classic really soon
Oct 31 2021,positive,im still in awe this is what movie theaters were made for what an amazing experience
Oct 31 2021,positive,makes you wonder what was so hard about adapting this movie just do it like that ez pz
Oct 31 2021,negative,i really dont get all the hype i personally dont find paul to be relatable or interesting the whole world is uninteresting honestly performances are average and so was the writing special effects and cinematography were the best parts i dont know what hanz zimmer was smoking when we wrote the score but its probably his worst work and im a big fan of his the movie was long simply for the sake of being long there was so much unneeded filler
Oct 31 2021,positive,great visual effects but really disjointed story line and the music was just too overwhelming  but still glad i saw it
Oct 31 2021,positive,this movie was the most important unique and engaging movie ive seen in 2021 music was incredible loved the acting and overall emotion portrayed recommend
Oct 31 2021,positive,this is the version that i imagine frank herbert saw in his mind when he wrote the book
Oct 31 2021,positive,it was a great movie because it represented the book well  thank you
Oct 31 2021,negative,boring and the worst thing is they plan on doing another there is no character building no story line
Oct 31 2021,positive,great storyfabulous cinematographycouldve been shorter
Oct 31 2021,positive,having read the book i can say this is the best film adaptation possible  incredible attention to detail plot moved at a good pace and was everything i hoped cannot wait for part 2
Oct 31 2021,positive,far and away the best dune adaptation  even though its only half the story    visually impressive finely acted sufficiently faithful to the novel
Oct 31 2021,positive,such an amazing movie the sound effects visuals and soundtrack are all fucking insane
Oct 31 2021,neutral,it was either a long movie or a very long trailer setting up for further dunes kind of like a desert that goes on and on and on  one dune after the other the pacing was erratic and characterization minimal
Oct 31 2021,positive,denis villeneuve and hans zimmer have created a masterpiece i really enjoyed the many sci fi elements of this film having not read the book it was a hard to pick out what some characters were saying at points this led me to be a little confused but i still understood the overall story my second viewing changed my rating from four to five stars after i understood more of what was happening cant wait for part 2 and 3 and hopefully so on
Oct 31 2021,positive,dunes strength lies within how it presents the story rather than the story itself its overlong and dull plot is made up with powerful performances spectacular visuals and a stellar soundtrack the way everything was filmed and planned makes this a perfect fit for anyone who is just looking for visual scifi escapism
Oct 31 2021,positive,followed the book pretty well
Oct 31 2021,positive,its not fair that we have to wait two yrs
Oct 31 2021,positive,brilliant and breathtaking
Oct 31 2021,positive,in his book robert mckee says because story is often thin or absent in the art film again directors must compensate information or sensory stimulation lush production design and photography or musical scores to pleasure the audiences senses dune feels like an art film with extremely big budget some may have felt deceived because of its genre budget and cast they thought they would get a often forced and cliched transformation effects and cacophonous derringdo per mckee
Oct 31 2021,neutral,the movie was too long with too much humdrum in between it started off great with some great stars but it ended with a dead end with unknowns with no real storyline other than a young boy will be his daddys replacement in the future and yes you guessed it the young caucasian boy will be the key to the future  while the others follow
Oct 31 2021,positive,this was ana amazing film to experience especially in imax denis will make you feel your in the movie with the characters definitely worth watching in imax
Oct 31 2021,positive,this version made me appreciate the creativity of david lynchs vision of the movie
Oct 31 2021,positive,a beautiful interpretation of the story fantastic cast stellar direction amazing scale and pacing loved it the whole way
Oct 30 2021,positive,great movie whereas in the 1984 version the entire book was covered by the movie this one splits the book in two so we gotta wait for that nonetheless we really enjoyed it overall a great experience overall
Oct 30 2021,positive,cinematography and acting
Oct 30 2021,positive,i think that first part of the saga dune are very good
Oct 30 2021,positive,man what a ride this movie was an absolute pleasure to experience
Oct 30 2021,negative,pacing was off and transitions disjointed way too much time spent on scenery and way too little on character development visually unimaginative with none of the arresting scenes of the earlier version lead role wasnt cast well felt like a bad trailer for part 2 fell asleep
Oct 30 2021,positive,masterpiece i wish it stood alone cant wait for part 2
Oct 30 2021,positive,amazing if youre familiar with original dune movie or the book series cant wait for part 2
Oct 30 2021,negative,it looked good  but it was intensely boring
Oct 30 2021,positive,lots of what was in the book was packed into this first film reading beforehand gives lots of background the scenery is amazing
Oct 30 2021,positive,wasnt bad  will see the sequel 
Oct 30 2021,positive,i enjoyed this adaptation  definitely excited to see what they do for part 2
Oct 30 2021,positive,its certainly a much better effort than the 1984 film version it seemed well cast and acted and ill definitely see part 2
Oct 30 2021,negative,long and boring movie drags fell asleep
Oct 30 2021,negative,characters were not interesting enough because of no focus on them no backstory no sense of who they really are no charm very dark film mediocre story and not told well and so many visions i never liked visions much but i can tolerate or even like them sometimes but here so many and mostly unnecessary to the story they could give us some important dialogue instead to better understand the characters or the politics
Oct 30 2021,positive,very good adaptation it lays a beautiful foundation for the world and im so excited for the 2nd and future installments which im hopeful there will be many just know going in that it is a slow developing movie that is not meant to feel completed at the end     to those saying it feels they made it a 2 part movie for no good reason like the hobbit i couldnt disagree more denis villeneuve did a great job of drawing you in to the world and building a connection with the world something i found was lacking in the 1984 version which was 1 movie
Oct 30 2021,positive,a bit annoyed at not being told this was the first movie in what i now assume will be 3 or 4 movies  plus really poor choice of where to pause the story if i had the writer and director in front of me id kick them both  that said what was there was very well done beautifully filmed if not quite the character developement i would have liked and it was a tiny bit dispassionate which is not a word i would have used with this material before this movie  i do recommend but go into it with your eyes open
Oct 30 2021,positive,much better than the original just sorry i have to wait for part 2
Oct 30 2021,positive,it tells you right from the beginning this is part 1 so i wasnt expecting the full story i loved this film especially the cinematography and visualspecial effects do yourself a favor and see this film as it was intendedin imax or at the very least on a big screen
Oct 30 2021,positive,wasnt sure i would like it but i did
Oct 30 2021,negative,well visually the film is incredible the cg was on point the music was pretty good except the same piece was used during every dramatic scene and played far to loud which was basically all the time     as for the story well we left 2 hours in and got a refund it was awful turns out this is part 1 which isnt mentioned anywhere on the promotional stuff and even 2 hours in we still didnt what the f was going on
Oct 30 2021,positive,loved dune the politics sci fi cinematography acting were well balanced hopefully the studio green lights the sequels
Oct 30 2021,positive,very interesting beginning but theres no ending feels like it has been let down by being split into multiple parts for the sake of making money similar to the hobbit movies
Oct 30 2021,negative,when i saw the trailer for this movie i was blown away and anxious to see this movie i didnt get what i expected i know its just one mans opinion and it seems that i am going against the grain but i was let down by this movie while watching this movie it seemed to me that i was watching the ramblings of a druginduced madman it turns out that mr frank herbert really did dabble in what is called in the drug world magic mushrooms  from wikipedia another significant source of inspiration for dune was herberts experiences with psilocybin and his hobby of cultivating mushrooms according to mycologist paul stametss account of meeting herbert in the 1980s if that is how he got his inspiration then i am not going to judge but i expected to be a little more entertained the score was by hans zimmer who has wrote many of very rousing things like for crimson tide and other movies i do not know what he was doing here but it was annoying i know no one is going to decline to see this movie because of anything that im saying but i am just telling you to prepare yourself good luck 
Oct 30 2021,positive,saw dune in imax the desert scenes were breathtakingly beautiful
Oct 30 2021,positive,amazing visuals awsome world great movie and great adaptation 45 stars just becouse it is just first half of first story
Oct 30 2021,positive,marvelous film from start to finish cant wait for dune 2 
Oct 30 2021,positive,a long and layered epic its a slow burner but well worth the time if you enjoy serious sci fi stunning visual a stacked cast and well written script all under the steady hand of directed dennis villenueve
Oct 30 2021,positive,great movie only part i didnt like was that it ended wanted to see more cant wait til second one comes out
Oct 30 2021,positive,its a great movie and i have fun watching it  i hope theres more of it
Oct 30 2021,positive,breathtakingly beautiful
Oct 30 2021,positive,brilliant and chase full adaptation of the novel the visuals are simply stunning knowing that it is the first half of the full story allow me to understand the slow build up i plan to see it a second time
Oct 30 2021,positive,if you have read the books the you will see that this movie sticks to the story very well donea vast improvement over the first attempt
Oct 30 2021,negative,i do not get the high ratings  there is no character development at all sure the cgi is great but with no connection to the characters it became booooooring
Oct 30 2021,positive,quite slow in the beginning but the end was exciting
Oct 30 2021,negative,it is an alarm signal when i as a viewer get the feeling that the film music and epic pictures are being used for the sole reason to give the whole film more tension and magnificence in order to hide the fact that the film is simply told in a boring way instead of relying on a suspenseful story villeneuve underlays beautiful landscape shots with such a powerful loud and dramatic music score that it tore me out of the story every time and i began to think about why these scenes which were rather insignificant for the process of the story had such a dramaturgy it almost seems as if villeneuve is afraid that his movie would be too boring without blade runner 2049 had the same problem villeneuve seems to use epic images and a dramatic and loud soundtrack to distract from the fact that he just doesnt have what it takes to tell exciting and good stories
Oct 30 2021,positive,much better than the original film
Oct 30 2021,negative,it sucked so borijg omfg pls dont make a pt 2 
Oct 30 2021,positive,was everything i hoped and imagined it to be considering it was part 1 of 2 excellent performances cinematography background score and adaptation of the screenplay
Oct 30 2021,positive,i love the dune books so i was hyped when this was coming out didnt disappoint the casting was absolutely on point loved paul the baron duncan chani and stilgar was a standout performance too several really impactful scenes  obviously the gom jabbar but also the fight with jamis and others some bits in the middle were a bit bland so it didnt quite reach the heights of lotr for me i had high hopes ok dune is one of my favourite books still hats off denis villeneuve
Oct 30 2021,positive,the movie picks up kind of slow
Oct 30 2021,positive,while certainly not perfect this was my favorite film ive seen in the past 10 years visually it was magnificent and while the story certainly proceeded at a breakneck pace and glanced over certain details i remained engrossed throughout i debated whether or not to drive a few towns over to see it in imax and i was very happy that i took the time to do so
Oct 30 2021,positive,awesome adaptation of the novel villeneuve creates visual and sonic motifs that resonate well with themes within the story which helps bring coherence to the task of telescoping a complex novel into a 2part movie in an elegant way the film does not suffer from clunky exposition or the annoying voiceovers of the alan smithee david lynch version its visually beautiful and the cast does not disappoint this first instalment is a great setup for the next film in what hopefully will be a trilogy but may only be a 2part story
Oct 30 2021,positive,excellent movie cant wait for the next one
Oct 30 2021,positive,great fun movie epic experience in imax cant wait for the sequel
Oct 30 2021,negative,jesus christ thats 2 and half hours of my life wasted so dull my head almost fell off
Oct 30 2021,positive,it was incredible  i thought  so much scale huge scenes awesome cast and sound i was totally engrossed
Oct 30 2021,positive,great story acting direction cinematography score one of the best scifi films
Oct 30 2021,positive,i never read to the books so it was pretty weird to me but i was pretty entertained 
Oct 30 2021,positive,can we get some new actor talent please instead of the same same ole star wars and avengers actors its a turn off its like they have a monopoly on hollywood i get it you need big name actors to promote a hollywood film but the same old marvel and stars wars characters cmon man
Oct 30 2021,positive,little long and slow going at times but a good vision of the story
Oct 30 2021,positive,it was quite confusing for those who know nothing of the source material but it was still an entertaining and thought provoking adventure nonetheless
Oct 30 2021,positive,the dune movie the world deserves cant wait for part 2
Oct 30 2021,positive,denis villeneuve continues to do a great job on his works cinematographically the film is impeccable the casting was incredible and contributed to the development of the narrative
Oct 30 2021,positive,a great improvement from the 1984 movie  this was much closer to the book and they didnt mush the following books into one bad movie  i am looking forward to the next part 2 movie  the actors were chosen well to reflect the characters of dune and the special effects were spot on
Oct 30 2021,positive,comfy seats great movie
Oct 30 2021,positive,the movie the beautiful but quite long and hard to follow if you hadnt read the book
Oct 30 2021,negative,it was boring it made no sense
Oct 30 2021,negative,a remake of lynchs 1984 version instead of a new take on the rich source material this movie wastes a lot of time not doing anything if you like forced exposition and meager characterization then this is for you
Oct 30 2021,positive,it was a great experience i particularly like the actor who plays paul his mix of pride and vulnerability was appreciated and that he looked more like a nerd than a superhero was also pleasing the one thing that stood out was that some of the technology of this future still seemed very clunky the landings of the spaceships seemed less refined than would be thought for that future date not so much futuristic as old scifi recommended now how long until the story continues
Oct 30 2021,positive,ive been waiting for this movie since i first read dune as a sophomore at the u this is just great wonderful i would say the best movie ive seen in a long time     go see it in a theater be lost in it
Oct 30 2021,positive,best adaptation to the books
Oct 30 2021,positive,literal masterpiece  every frame was exceptional combined with the brilliant piece of music and awesome story followed by legendary direction its a brilliant cinema
Oct 30 2021,positive,came into this with mediocre expectations and left impressed loved the ambience created by long scenes of tension between landscape music and plot beautifully designed space and planet aesthetics the character development is good and action scenes are spot on very much looking forward to the next installment may even have to read the book
Oct 30 2021,positive,awesome adaptation of the book  recommend to everyone  cant wait to meet  little sister
Oct 30 2021,positive,this was the best science fiction movie i have seen in decades cant wait for the extended directors cut version the production crew and director created an universe worthy of dune finally the curse is over and we are gifted with a real scifi franchise the music is groundbraking costume design is right on
Oct 30 2021,positive,amazing see it in imax
Oct 30 2021,positive,they should have went with the 4hr run time and finished the first story then part 2 could have been children of dune which more easily can be broken up into multiple movies
Oct 30 2021,positive,i saw this movie in a theater unlike any i had experienced previously electric reclining seats dolby atmos surround sound enormous screen no ones head in the view  the movie  i read the book decades ago and definitely wanted to see this movie  the visuals effects sounds were totally engrossing  every vibration was felt every image was full how amazing  but did you predict there was a but the storyline as told felt like it was a setup for the next battle scene which seemed constant at times like a violent video game  the dialog was weak with responses like im good with all the technology shown why is the weapon of choice a large knife  obviously i hoped for more  as always just my opinion
Oct 30 2021,positive,fantastic movie yes there are parts that are slow but it is incredible to watch the scenes and special effects ive not seen anything like this in a long time looking forward to part 2 
Oct 30 2021,positive,best seen in imax i got more of the plot and connections in the film on the second viewing highly recommend it if you are any kind of a good person you have a high chance of liking it
Oct 30 2021,positive,its one the best scifi movies i have seen in a long time
Oct 30 2021,positive,i thought the movie was good seen it twice and i loved it i do think the movie should have been cut about 15 minutes as ben shapiro has stated in his review the worm scene would of been a good stopping point other than that everybody does great with the acting the directing is great and the story is intriguing jason momoa was awesome
Oct 30 2021,positive,it felt like i was watching a tv series it had nice visual effects but i needed more action if you are action type of person this has minimal theres some but not alot
Oct 30 2021,positive,a cinema must the genius that is hans zimmer in addition to the wow factor of a dedicated dolby sound system puts you right in the middle of this otherworldly feast for the eyes this has classic written all over it the only negative i can think of was that it ended too soon despite its two and a half hour runtime sit back and enjoy
Oct 30 2021,negative,nothing but annoying music  simple lines dont waste your time just read the book
Oct 30 2021,positive,barely just barely i like minimalism snd brutalism in architecture too but that is not what i expect in dune as nice as the soundtrack is it does not go beyond ok looking forward to part 2 though snd glad we are having it
Oct 30 2021,positive,hypnotic experience its a joy to watch you feel like those times when you see something that amazing that you cant even blink the cinematography the score the photography incredible
Oct 30 2021,positive,amazing visuals and music  the sense of world building and scale is up there with the greatest scifi and fantasy movies  see this on the biggest screen possible
Oct 30 2021,positive,hands down the best movie ive seen since bladerunner every shot is legit a work of art i could have seen it free on hbomax but choose to see it in theaters due to my excitement ill gladly pay to see it a second and possibly third time
Oct 30 2021,positive,didnt like such a large cliff hanger and thought the movie could have gone longer otherwise it was awesome looking forward to seeing part 2
Oct 30 2021,positive,special effects were fantastic  great storyline
Oct 30 2021,positive,strong story line impressive big screen effects dramatic action and adventure and no explicit or graphic scenes offensive to minors conservative audiences at times dialog was difficult to hear spoken softly in low tones in big theatre and follow
Oct 30 2021,positive,must see scifi had no idea about anything dune related and loved it  didnt want it to end great amount of world building and left me wanting more highly recommend
Oct 30 2021,positive,warner bros did not do to dune what apple did to foundation dune is not woke its a fairly faithful adaptation of the original work by frank herbert it avoids the sometimes manic and overreaching production by de laurentiis and lynch which tried to cram too much dune into one film villeneuve focuses most of the film on paul atreides which works well hopefully we see more world building in the next 2 films the dune series is vast and theres enough content for dozens of films if theyre like this one i will go see all of them
Oct 30 2021,positive,fantastic as i am not familiar with the book this movie was incredible the cinematography was incredible the action sequences were incredible very well written and a great cast would highly recommend 
Oct 30 2021,positive,as an avid reader of the series of books i would have to say this is the definitive edition this is the greatest book adaption better than the first four seasons of game of thrones and also i believe it is a better adaptation than lord of the rings  the lighting color correction color grading shadow detail all perfection cinematography editing sound mixing score vfx are absolutely perfection timothee and rebecca are fabulous in their roles as paul and jessica what can we say about oscar isaac that hasnt already been said a standout that i wasnt expecting was mamoa he surprised me 9710 masterpiece
Oct 30 2021,neutral,incredible special effects and decent not amazing acting but felt way too long of a movie  almost as if they were purposefully not moving the story along fast enough to help draw out the storyline for future sequels i went into the movie not knowing there would be sequels so was not surprised when mentioned at the end of the movie
Oct 30 2021,positive,one of the best movie in 2021
Oct 30 2021,positive,pacing might be slow for some honestly this was a 25 hour movie that didnt feel like it it had my attention the whole time the acting was excellent and it is a visual masterpiece
Oct 30 2021,positive,i went in cold not knowing anything about the books or movie it was very good i was thoroughly engaged this is definitely one to see on the big screen
Oct 30 2021,positive,challenging concept and script incredible special effects 
Oct 30 2021,positive,one of the best movies ever made pure gem    enough said
Oct 30 2021,positive,i recommend to watch the special effects and sound were awesome was not alot of action some scenes felt th  like they dragged on but maybe i would of enjoyed more if i read the books
Oct 30 2021,positive,visually stunning great cast true to the book as i remember it worth getting back to the theater to see it
Oct 30 2021,positive,one of the best movies i have ever seen dune should easily win an oscar for sound effects
Oct 30 2021,positive,visually stunning thought about getting streaming to watch at home but so glad i didnt
Oct 30 2021,positive,the beginning of something amazing it is visually beautiful it engages you in the narrative and leaves you begging for more of that more of that universe
Oct 30 2021,positive,i really enjoyed this version of dune it did feel like there was a lot of meat left in the bone but its understandable considering that this first part of only half the novel
Oct 30 2021,positive,having read the original series so many times and having suffered through the previous attempts at screenplays of the story i was wary of another film version i am simply in awe of how emotionally connected and well made this one is my only criticism would be that there were a few plot set up elements missing for clarity other than that perfection
Oct 30 2021,positive,awesome scifi movie great visual effects and good storytelling i enjoyed it very much
Oct 30 2021,positive,i enjoyed the movie  it has been a long time since i have read the book  that is a good thing  in addition to watching a good movie i am motivated to read the story again
Oct 30 2021,positive,visually stunning a storyline which keeps you captivated and assuring it can only get better with the sequels gotinspace
Oct 30 2021,positive,awesome movie put yourself in the moment
Oct 30 2021,positive,great movie much better than the 1984 dune film visually stunning storyline and acting kept me captivated through the end
Oct 30 2021,positive,first of all the cgi in this movie is the best i have ever seen it was slow some parts some parts i felt were unnecessary and useless i hope in the second one we get more of zendayas back story i also hope to see the villains i forgot their name a lot more and see what they are do physicallycombat the emperor seemed cool but i didnt feel intimidated by him i wish they had a backstory for dunkin cause i didnt really feel like i cared for him dying  i didnt read the book 
Oct 30 2021,positive,if you know the story its awesome  very true to the book  the photography and music are impressive and the actors are great too  if you dont know the story it might be difficult to follow
Oct 30 2021,positive,visually epic with a sweeping permeating score this film takes the source material and encapsulates the scale of what we need to see as well as making room for quiet introspective moments for the characters the used universe so well established in star wars et al breathes life into worlds of clashing cultures and ideals yet remains steadfastly separate from any vision but the writers own paced well nothing is rushed and there are many moments that entertain and let the audience indulge in awe a standout cast only cements what is truly a spectacular achievement leaving us hanging on for more cinema at its true zenith
Oct 30 2021,positive,great movie does justice to the book wish part 2 was under production no telling when it will be released
Oct 30 2021,positive,part 1 cmon just make one movie good flick if it had ended
Oct 30 2021,positive,having read the first dune trilogy 3 times i am happy that they stayed true to the story line  i am looking forward to part 2  3  4 etc
Oct 30 2021,neutral,little hokey especially the special sand walk not very original very slow moving predictable too psychedelic
Oct 30 2021,positive,absolutely amazing it is a faithful adaptation of the book and visually beautiful every shot is a work of art the acting is incredible and the special effects feel real a literary work of art translated into a visual work of art the movie is split into two parts this is part one and i really hope they greenlight part two
Oct 30 2021,positive,i never actually saw the original but this was a great movie
Oct 30 2021,positive,it should of ended 15 minutes earlier but its an absolutely amazing movie the performances the direction the world building the vfx the score and the cinematography are all stunning
Oct 30 2021,positive,first movie weve been to in a theater since the pandemic began  great story and acting beautiful cinematography and well done special effects  the only thing i disliked is that it was a little too drawn out  not terribly so but it felt like it could have been a bit shorter  but we are looking forward to the next one
Oct 30 2021,positive,this film could not have been crafted any better than villeneuve and crew have managed to do here  it does way more than just give justice to the books it brings the duniverse to truly magnificent life  as a fan of the novel and series currently about to finish heretics for the first time around seeing these characters places and technologies come alive on the big screen was an emotional and engaging cinematic experience like no other  please watch this on the largest screen possible imax baby and enjoy the theatrical experience of a lifetime  never have i wanted a movie not to end as much as this onei cant wait for part 2  impatience is the satisfactionkiller  if amen part 2 is made with as much love passion and respect to the novel as was done hereladies and gentlemen well have a masterpiece on our hands  and if this legendary crew goes on to make the whole freaking seriesyou can sign my gravestone with not human  death by gom jobbar after having inserted my right hand into the box of hypeexcitement
Oct 30 2021,positive,now that a sequel has been announced this movie is an absolute must watch
Oct 30 2021,positive,havent gotten into this whole story line till now but this is a well written and well executed story nicely done 
Oct 30 2021,positive,ive read the book read it in anticipation of the movie actually and despite this i wasnt anticipating how beautiful and brutal the story would be on the big screen its primal it gets some shade for being a basic white savior story but i think thats an oversimplification elements of the monomyth are there great acting great score near the end started to realize the story would be cut short as theyre planning a series of these that brought me out of the movie for a moment but i was brought right back in by pauls coming of age struggle to cope with his fate and his new fremen friends id put this right up there with blade runner and yes the original star wars as one of the best science fiction films ive ever seen
Oct 30 2021,positive,i try not to go to the movies often so i chose my movies carefully of what i am willing to go see in the theater this one is definitely worth seeing on the big screen some of the scenes are just so gorgeous to look at plus im intrigued by the acting in this film so many well known actors but its amazing to see them in their element creating an entire different universe before our eyes its great storytelling when it comes down to it with all the elements coming together with amazing cinematography i am amazed at how much better this version of dune is compared to the previous one they didnt have the technology back then to do the special effects right this one just brings it all together in a way that makes it easier for you to forget all else and just be immediately sucked into the storyline i highly recommend it
Oct 30 2021,positive,a wonderfully realised world with stunning cinematography stellar performances by all  cant wait for the next installment
Oct 30 2021,positive,i havent seen a film this well executed since i cant even remember perfect casting incredible cinematography and sound design incredible script and excellent pacing denis villeneuve is a master
Oct 30 2021,positive,probably the best adaptation of herberts dune novel that we are likely to get
Oct 30 2021,positive,science fiction art house feast to the eyes  the performance is excellent across the board 1010
Oct 30 2021,positive,some of the best camerawork effects and soundtracks ive ever experienced in a film absolutely incredible must watch in imax
Oct 30 2021,positive,great presentation of the story
Oct 30 2021,positive,great visuals did the book well wouldve preferred a 5 hour movie 
Oct 30 2021,negative,a great plot with poor execution if you can manage to stay awake through the monotone characters long drawn out scenes and silence its a good movie for its cinematography and almost eluding story
Oct 30 2021,negative,looks like a vague replica of star wars with innate supernatural powers in a messiah like figure against an evil emperor and a monster looking army the slow build up stretches through the first instalment was painful even though there are spectacular scenes and gothic soundtrack the resemblance of a messiah figure with the arabic context is unmistakable definitely not going for the next few instalments
Oct 30 2021,positive,loved it the way is filmed the rhythm of it  watched for the second time on the big screen 
Oct 30 2021,positive,incredible movie i havent been this drawn into a movie in many years so much so that i forgot most of the way through this was only part 1 
Oct 30 2021,positive,you can tell the cast and crew had a love for the original novels its paced rather well the only problem is part i is mostly setup for something bigger theres quite a few scene stealing proformances and none of the characters out stayed their welcome definitely looking forward to part ii when it comes out
Oct 30 2021,positive,finally a real movie
Oct 30 2021,negative,i left about halfway through it was ten times worse than the original but looked nice if you arent into content i highly recommend it
Oct 30 2021,neutral,i dont like how it ended on a cliff hanger would rather it been a longer movie and it finished
Oct 30 2021,positive,fantastic visuals  cinematography story takes a while to build but this is part one after all the ending makes me eager to see part two when it comes out characters are well chosen visually  acting is what id expect for a piece like this well done
Oct 30 2021,positive,the best thing my eyes have seen on the big screen since forever
Oct 30 2021,positive,zendaya was hot but the storytelling felt a little redundant and they killed daddy jason too early
Oct 30 2021,positive,the first 10 seconds beat the entire 1984 dune great movie
Oct 30 2021,positive,started out ok good action scenes but it dragged on for too long towards the end and so many desert scenes zzzzzzzz
Oct 30 2021,neutral,visually stunning and less confusing than the original top notch casting turned in good performances but the plot holes are insurmountable spoiler alert the emperor apparently planned to set house atreides up for failure by allowing them to run behind on spice production giving the harkonnen an excuse to attack however they are on arakis only a short time before the harkonnen attack not enough time to fall behind     house harkonnen seems upset that control of arakis was taken away from them but they were in on the plot with the emperor and knew why he took this action  this is why they were able to enlist imperial troops in the assault     i can overlook minor plot holes like how creatures miles long can survive and maintain their size with so little available food or why security was so lax when duke leto expected an attack also why does the family physician have access to the security codes    however with the main premise of the story so full of plot holes i cannot recommend this movie
Oct 30 2021,positive,faithful rendition of the book
Oct 30 2021,positive,the new legendary trilogy that will sit on the high shelf along star wars and the hobbit
Oct 30 2021,positive,i absolutely enjoyed more than i thought i would

Oct 30 2021,positive,beginning was somewhat confusing mostly we enjoyed the movie and glad we saw it on the big screen
Oct 30 2021,positive,omg dunee what a great movie is totally different a present us a new saga timothee chalamet steals the show the photography is insane and de vfx shut my mouth this is absolutely the movie of the decade
Oct 30 2021,positive,visually stunning and endlessly impressive dune is mostly setup but what an overwhelmingly wellcrafted setup it is everything from the excellent effects to the quietly powerful performances to the booming score and creative costumes all work together to form a compelling introduction to an exciting epic saga
Oct 30 2021,positive,cant wait for part 3 yep i said it im that confident
Oct 30 2021,positive,an absolute scifi spectacle from beginning to end films like this are a rare occasion today and dune deserves to be seen and appreciated on the biggest screen available acting directing scorepretty much everything across the board is on another level
Oct 30 2021,positive,i actually liked the movie better than the book
Oct 30 2021,positive,there was no ending it just ended
Oct 30 2021,positive,top notch imagery and very true to the book
Oct 30 2021,negative,such a slow movie looks like start wars but much worse cant believe it got good reviews 
Oct 30 2021,positive,finally a masterpiece something that comes along every 10 years or so the visuals and the score fit the movie perfect must see in the theater ive watched it twice on hbo max but had to watch it one more time on the big screen cant wait till october 2023
Oct 30 2021,positive,true to the books storyline excellent visual and sound effects
Oct 30 2021,positive,so far this is my favorite movie of the year the scale scope and magnitude of this movie is unmatched the film is mature and doesnt baby the audience i am now heavily invested in this world and excited for the future
Oct 30 2021,negative,long like eternity long  finally got better 2 hours in for an awful ending i dont know how this has a 90 audience rating
Oct 30 2021,positive,one of the most amazing adaptations of the dune story i have seen visually extraordinarily well done
Oct 30 2021,positive,epic type movie very well acted great character development
Oct 30 2021,positive,spectacular stellar cinematography very close to the book cant wait for part 2
Oct 30 2021,negative,horrible  long boring film
Oct 30 2021,negative,boring dusty and slow will put you to sleep
Oct 30 2021,positive,one of the best science fiction movies of all time please support so hollywood continues to make amazing cerebral science fiction movies like this
Oct 30 2021,neutral,the movie would have been better served to be another 30 minutes longer to get the viewer invested in the antagonists  it felt like it was a little bit of dialog and story to link fight scenes
Oct 30 2021,positive,absolutely a great film and perfect interpretation of the frank herbert novel i loved all of it the music the drama and the acting i will be seeing multiple it times until the next installment the last time i was this ecstatic about a movie was the original star wars
Oct 30 2021,positive,top tier soundtrack visual effects and acting 1110
Oct 30 2021,positive,fear is the mind killer best dune film to date see it in the theater
Oct 30 2021,positive,the dialogue was not easily heard over the music  much of the plot was murky    the effects were great as was the cast
Oct 30 2021,positive,saw it 4dx and was worth every penny stunning visuals and kept mostly true to the book
Oct 30 2021,positive,loved it cant wait for the next chapter
Oct 30 2021,positive,cinematography exceptional excellent acting cant wait for next one
Oct 30 2021,positive,loved it cant wait for the sequel
Oct 30 2021,positive,the action is great but it is few and far between expect high fantasy the likes of the lord of the rings with the same sweeping visuals and massive sets very excited for part 2
Oct 30 2021,positive,its very gorgeously made first of its just visually stunning the cgi is barely noticeable and the cinematography is great but the score is so different from any blockbuster and fits the scheme of this film so well and elevates the parts when its played also the casting is well done and the concept of many things is so creative and well done even the transitioning to different scenes is wonderful the only thing badish is very few parts felt a little bit extended and should have maybe been a teeny bit shorter or got to the point quicker but it only happens like 2 or 3 times its definitely made for the big screen especially for the score being blasted into your ears its totally worth checking out in theaters rating a
Oct 30 2021,positive,awesome i loved the aspects of the different languagescommunication
Oct 30 2021,positive,will go down as a scifi classic beautiful visuals unique universe  an intriguing story
Oct 30 2021,positive,great movie to see in imax
Oct 30 2021,positive,i loved how true to book the film was the acting was spot on and i dont usually like chalamet mamoa was an excellent duncan idaho oscar isaacs was a great duke leto they were all good really     but the movie could have been a little shorter we did not need quite so many shots of the desert or the ornithopters cool as they are i get the dramatic build and all but it was a lot    and the score this is a me problem  theres a certain vibrating sound i associate with bagpipes i hate bagpipes i felt like the whole score reverberated with that sound there were even actual bagpipes at times  it didnt help that the theater i was in was way too loud  ill probably see the second one at home so my ears dont bleed its a great score for people who enjoy bagpipes
Oct 30 2021,positive,films like dune are very rare to see like the book this film rewards the patient viewer anyone who liked the book or who enjoys immersive detailed filmmaking with a grand scope that harkens back to films like 2001 a space odyssey or works from david lean should watch this movie this film could have no dialogue and with picture and sound alone it would still effectively transport you into this living breathing world despite the novels deep lure and layered plot you could probably still follow the basic narrative of this film even without dialogue yes the film explores those layers and lure visually and covers them through some well placed dialogue but do you need all that to enjoy the film and understand the basic plot of this unique cinematic experience no
Oct 30 2021,neutral,wheres the rest of it
Oct 30 2021,positive,nice made 2 hours and change seem like a blink of an eye
Oct 30 2021,neutral,more style than substance the films strong visuals arent enough to make up for the thin plot and poor character development in particular among the male characters but it does manage to entertain
Oct 30 2021,positive,exceptional special effects and great dialogue  addresses a lot of the short comings of the original like voice overs  super dark just like i like em
Oct 30 2021,positive,in a time of super heroe formula movies dune is a freaking fresh air love it
Oct 30 2021,positive,i enjoyed dune very much i thought denis villeneuve did a wonderful job
Oct 30 2021,negative,the movie was visually amazing score as well that doesnt mean it was a great first film for this series the pacing dragged on this was basically a two and half hour trailer for the next film if they kept the casual viewer that is i dont feel connected to any of the main characters besides side character duncan i voiced this criticism to a coworker who apparently is a huge fan of the novel who told me my opinion doesnt matter because i never read the book i shouldnt have to read the novel to enjoy a film adaptation all these complicated house names and the main characters name is paul save yourself the time and just watch it on dvd when you have time to pause and turn on the brightness
Oct 30 2021,positive,if you read the book and liked it you will love this movie
Oct 30 2021,negative,only gave it a star because it was visually beautiful besides that it was all over the place super boring and the plot was so poorly written i literally wanted to stop watching it after the first half hour but forced myself to watch the entire film super disappointed a star wars it will never be 
Oct 30 2021,positive,brilliant i wondered how they could capture the essence of the book but they did it
Oct 30 2021,positive,the movie was great a little slow start but leaves you wanting more
Oct 30 2021,positive,been an avid fan of frank herbert since i first read the first book and i havent stopped reading
Oct 30 2021,negative,dune is a mumbled  dusty and poorly written movie with only one goal to introduce the sequel
Oct 30 2021,positive,aesthetically beautiful impeccable cast faithful adaptation of a legendary novel just understand this is part one before you go in
Oct 30 2021,positive,loved it  just disappointed that it only covered 12 of the book  i sure hope part 2 is in the works
Oct 30 2021,positive,followed the book pretty well and was fun to watch
Oct 30 2021,positive,i certainly liked all of the action scenes but had some difficulty understanding the dialogues since they were a little bit muffled
Oct 30 2021,positive,this is my favorite movie ive seen in a long time go see this film
Oct 30 2021,positive,did a fantastic job casting part 1 and the scenery was terrific as well as a lifelong fan of frank herberts fantasy this is by far a good start and i cant wait for the conclusion i think bautista makes a convincing rabonne and paul is perfect such a tough movie to tell so far so good
Oct 30 2021,negative,this was as exciting as sand blowing in the wind i couldnt even sit through the whole production there is a reason darth vader hates sand so much now i know why
Oct 29 2021,positive,the movie was terrific we had already watched it at home on hbo max but wanted to see it in imax the opry mills imax has been nicely remodeled but i was disappointed in the big imax signs on either side of the screen that was distracting at times while watching the movie id like to see those signs removed or blacked out for a less distracting viewing experience remove imax signs from the sides of the screen
Oct 29 2021,positive,great visuals looking forward to sequel
Oct 29 2021,positive,seeing on tv doesnt have the same impact on viewing experience blown away at imax theater
Oct 29 2021,positive,visually stunning and stays close to the books story line  i cant wait for part 2
Oct 29 2021,positive,great movie  i like the way they redid it with a new point of view  the cast is terrific  i would give a full five stars except for these two flaws  1 need more worm scenes good grief thats a major part of the story  2 i never like cliffhangers at the end  when i was a kid all the tv shows had cliff hangers and that burnt me out
Oct 29 2021,negative,just as bad as the david lynchs adaptation the acting is atrocious everyone either whispers their lines or shouts and just like the 1984 version the movie assumes youve read the book
Oct 29 2021,positive,brilliant first time ive ever posted but i did read this book when i was 13 years old are some of the best filmmaking ive ever seen not just saying that and the sound design and score is amazing
Oct 29 2021,positive,much improved over the david lynch version and significantly better than the syfy miniseries casting is spoton and they got the technology right if you loved the book youll love the movie
Oct 29 2021,positive,frank herberts mind   guns in future scifi no   bagpipes in future scifi yes    previously only knowing the source material from a far distance as one of the holy texts of a cult of science fiction geeks that could rattle off every detail at will and had strong opinions on every facet of it my only thought going into this film was sand worms but denis villeneuve for a book that is notorious not only for its depth but its focus on conveyng details through internal dialogue any adaptation was going to be a struggle between entertainment value length and faithfulness to herberts vision the original 1984 lynch adaptation found mixed success apparently in large part because it focused too heavily on exposition but here the script sticks to a healthy medium yes its a long film and only conveys half of the full story of the first book but it captures the audiences attention with its worldbuilding and scope to the point that even diehard fans seem to have come to accept its slight changes and omissions     hans zimmer needs to calm the fuck down i know hes attempting to convey the sweeping nature of the narrative and sought deliberately to deviate from his prior style by seeking inspiration from new instruments and desert environments but some of the chantyelling forces you to cover your ears in an imax theatre when hes working with christopher nolan he can fall back on the directors unorthodox choices for sound mixing but with the more restrained villeneuve theres less of an excuse the musical themes do work well with the material but my ears are still ringing     visually dune is a stunner tremendous sense of scale great landscapes interesting costumes it all heightens the sense of mystery and the lack of complete explanations and backstory for each faction that is introduced the sense of the unknown is conveyed very well and leaves you wanting more good performances all around even if momoa is just doing the bromoa character and dastmalchian is still fixed in my memory as polkadot man yes the ensemble cast is too substantial to each get their due depth skarsgårds baron harkonnen in particular is essentialy just a series of careful doublecrosses rolled up into a fatsuit but the runtime was long enough as is    overall great approach to the material its tough to judge a film accurately that was built from the groundup to cover only part of a narrative but this has the potential to be one of the great space operas 45
Oct 29 2021,positive,a really cool visually fantastic dark long sci fi fantasy thats super moody expect more emphasis on the world building and feeling of it than a character centric flick although youre able to keep track of who everyone is pretty well which is good cause theres a lot of people biggest complaint is that it feels incomplete and it rather abruptly ends but we know theres a second part so thatll be really cool to see this does kind of feel like a 2 and a half hour setup for the next movie which will hopefully be a really good punchline cause this has a lot of cool promises it makes
Oct 29 2021,positive,the movie was good  the special effects were terrific  no one have ever said that   this movie was dune part 1 and that was very disappointing
Oct 29 2021,positive,great adaptation of the classic frank herbert sf novel incredible soundtrack and special effects the story is solid as well with well developed characters the only negative is we have to wait at least two years for part two
Oct 29 2021,positive,great movie but read the book
Oct 29 2021,negative,every little bit if the plot was predictable and it was a horribly lazy one at that you could even say hey he will die later and presto all the good cgi comes to no importance when such a hyped movie becomes one like dune
Oct 29 2021,negative,awful there were literally like 10 plot lines going on all at once none properly explained except for the fact that some characters like to use hallucinogenic drugs between the creepy catholic nun with  a needle the naked fat man in a sauna and spaceships randomly flying around for no good reason i felt like i too was on drugs a bad trip i left after 30 minutes
Oct 29 2021,positive,it was a great movie  i hope they come out with another one  it kept my attention and was action packed which i liked but a lot of the words they used made it a little confusing
Oct 29 2021,positive,the cinematography was beyond phenomenal but this movie just had so many prolonged scenes that makes it tough to watch at some parts
Oct 29 2021,negative,development is far too slow  actors are excellent but plot is plodding
Oct 29 2021,positive,slow in the beginning but the character of paul is described well the cgi and cinematography was excellent  a good upgrade from previous film
Oct 29 2021,positive,this movie so beautiful to watch but it ends just as the story get interesting need to see part 2 badly
Oct 29 2021,positive,this is a masterpiece worthy of the dune universe dennis villneuve has created the right atmosphere and brought dune to life id say the only thing i wish this film had waa 2 more hours so dennis could tell the parts that were left because he does it  so well
Oct 29 2021,positive,visually stunning and engrossing film so happy i spent the money to view it in imax it has great writing and makes you hungry for part two
Oct 29 2021,positive,one of the greatest movies to come out please do part 2
Oct 29 2021,negative,good casting and big production values but the lighting was horrible  remember that mercifully short period when everything was shot in the dark for some reason  its back at least in dune scenes that could have been shot during the day were at night and hard to see  even the day shots in the desert managed to keep the characters poorly lit
Oct 29 2021,negative,poorly edited and so much so it ended up being brilliant incoherence and chaos
Oct 29 2021,positive,wonderful part 1 of an adaptation of herberts dune glad part 2 was already green lit cinematography is amazing really does need to be seen in imax and the story has all of the important parts and omissions or changes are inconsequential to the story thus far this makes the film approachable to those new to the dune universe this is my third viewing second in imax
Oct 29 2021,negative,i love scifi movies but i could not get into this one at all  the cinematography had the quality of a 1980s video and the meandering plot had no focus   sorry i cannot give a full review because i walked out of the cinema half way through
Oct 29 2021,negative,the film is not really difficult to understand and still its really horrible for the following reasons 1what is the obsession with spices are they sooo valuable i mean we have a whole spices section at the grand bazaar in istanbul just visit it and be done with it 2 the movie was so dark ive actually seen only 40 of it and its hard to see the facesemotions of the characters if not understanding who it is 3 during the launch of the movie you see zendaia all over the red carpet which is quite interesting mainly cause she has 15 min playtime and as last 4if you are not a fan boygirl of the books than just dont go you will walk away just like me asking for the lost 25 hours of you life back and naming this movie the worst thing youve ever seen in your life and i mean not only the worst movie but actually the worst thing youve seen ever
Oct 29 2021,negative,super disappointed by this as im a huge villeneuve fan granted i had never read the book but found the film to be overly dull pretentious and bleak the movie didnt have a single character to connect with i wanted to like this so much i realize this is part 1 of a 2 part story but a film should be able to stand on its own ie star wars a new hope which world builds and is a stand alone story without needing empire and yes of course its ironic that star wars was heavily influenced by dune the novel i found this a slog to get through and was checking my watch countless times to see how much was left i saw it in imax and although the scope score visuals and presentation was outstanding an entertaining experience does not equal a good movie
Oct 29 2021,positive,i really enjoyed this movie even with being so familiar with this story im excited for the second one
Oct 29 2021,positive,having read the original book it was great to see it come to life visually  a   great interpretation  the sets were amazing   my only complaint was that sometimes the actors were speaking in whispers or very lowly in tone that i had a hard time understanding them  was wishing for subtitles  am looking forward to part 2  maybe i need a hearing aids
Oct 29 2021,positive,if there is any other director aside from christopher nolan who has had the consistency that he has in his career as a filmmaker it would be denis villeneuve the man is simply a genius when it comes to the art of cinema and was the perfect choice to bring dune back to the big screen the latter title is based off a 1965 novel of the same name which is widely known as the most influential scifi novel of all time what i just described is about all i knew going into the film upon doing some more research i saw that george lucas was heavily influenced by the novel when he was writing star wars i have not seen the first incarnation of dune on the big screen which ive heard mixed things about but having heard all the buzz surrounding it i was naturally excited the trailers looked awesome the ensemble cast is enough to draw anyone into cinemas to see it and of course the crew behind the movie had someone like me expecting a masterpiece having seen it thats exactly what i got dune is quite simply a fantastic piece of cinema that had me hooked from the very first scene all the way to when the credits started rolling its a game changer for scifi and was a theater experience i wont forget anytime soon    from what i gather dune is like star wars if it wasnt as popular as it is so much lore so much backstory that a lot of people didnt think a film like this would be possible because it would be hard to get audiences hooked to give a short plot synopsis this is the story of paul atreides the son of a noble family entrusted with the protection of the most valuable asset and most vital substance in the galaxy paul and his family the noble house atreides are thrust into a war for the dangerous desert planet arrakis where the substance lies on this film stars an ensemble cast featuring timothée chalamet rebecca ferguson oscar isaac josh brolin stellan skarsgård dave bautista stephen mckinley henderson zendaya chang chen sharon duncanbrewster charlotte rampling jason momoa and the brilliant javier bardem thatspretty much the entire cast but i felt it was appropriate to name them all so you understand the sheer scope of talent surrounding this movie its well known that actors read a films script before deicding to or not to sign onto the project if all of these a list actors were in on it that should tell you something on top of the man whos directing the flick oh and hans zimmer is behind the films score honestly if youre me and you read all of that you dont even need to see the movie to know that its going to be great the directing in this film is nothing short of masterful ive watched movies with some very impressive visuals in my time and this movie is sitting far atop the list of best looking films ive ever seen the visuals have a depth to them that not many films have even the brilliance on display in the 3rd act of endgame dont matchup to the sheer scope of this film cinematographer greig fraser who worked on rogue one was the director of photography for this film as well having now seen both movies i can definitely see how this man had worked on rogue one especially during the 3rd act battle of that film he made those atat walkers feel massive and of course capturing the size of the death star in certain shots made it feel like a real machine you can just tell how passionate wb was about letting this team create this world and give it a visceral feel shots featuring these giant sandworms were some of the best and most detailed ive seen a creature or sequence featuring one in a long time i have to tip my hats off to the visual effects team because they all really outdid themselves with this film it really feels like a world that exists somewhere and thats the highest praise a vfx team can get so again cheers to them    circling back to how big the dune lore is and how many feared that it would be difficult to tell a story like this without just dumping loads of exposition i think they did a fantastic job all things considered the amount of lore and information the viewer has to understand to follow along with the story is massive this script does everything it needs to do without it feeling like theyre holding our hands the whole time for instance this certain ability that some people can do thats called the voice which allows them to influence other peoples actions is portrayed early on to us its given a scene where theres a brief explanation of what it is then its all presented through visual storytelling in the first scene with it we immediately understand its power through the films use of show dont tell it shows you that denis villeneuve and his writers have a high amount of respect for their audiences everything in this universe has to be communicated to the audience in a way that feels organic without an overload of exposition or backstory that can be a difficult task when the source material has so much information and depth already but again they did a great job communicating the key elements of the information that is most important for us the audience to grasp this story the long history of politics between civilizations who are fighting both physically and in ways like signing documents and whatnot its all presented very well and i wasnt confused in the slightest over what was going on    all of the acting in the movie was terrific especially from timothée chalamet rebecca ferguson and oscar isaac their family dynamic and monologue scenes between them all were great something im sure some members might not like is the fact that zendaya is not in the movie much shes more of a dream or apparition for chalamets character and doesnt show up until the end what i did not know but at the same time had a feeling for was that this is the first part of the story the film is marketed as its own thing but when the title card flashes it says dune part one though this movie stands as a film there is an incomplete feeling to it which isnt necessarily a bad thing as long as theres time to soak in the fact that theres more to tell unlike halloween kills which justended and now we have to wait until the next one dune felt much more like a movie that told what it needed to and will carry on to a hopeful sequel before writing this review i had no idea if a sequel would even happen because this movie was relying heavily on its box office numbers thankfully on 102621 the sequel was officially greenlit and announced by wb and is set for release in october 2023 so this makes me feel more at peace with the films ending that we will get a continuation of this story i hope everyone returns for the sequel especially villeneuve and hanz zimmer speaking of his music was absolutely incredible as it always is what was so majestic about this score in particular is it sounds like music hans zimmer would write but it also sounds like something very reminiscent to something he would write weird analogy but it shows you how versatile the man is when it comes to composing music    i absolutely loved this film its one of the best movies of the year and continues to solidify october 2021 as one of the best octobers theres been in cinema no time to die the last duel and now dune its been a fabulous month for movies and i could not be happier with how this film turned out please do not watch this movie on hbo max this was made for the movie theater go see it in imax or dolby while its still on those screens if its not on those anymore you owe it to yourself to experience where it was made to be seen heres a quote from denis villeneuve himself back when it was announced with hbo max streaming wb movies simultaneously he blasted wb by saying    dune is by far the best movie ive ever made my team and i devoted more than three years of our lives to make it a unique big screen experience our movies image and sound were meticulously designed to be seen in theaters im speaking on my own behalf though i stand in solidarity with the sixteen other filmmakers who now face the same fate please know i am with you and that together we are strong the artists are the ones who create movies and series i strongly believe the future of cinema will be on the big screen no matter what any wall street dilettante says since the dawn of time humans have deeply needed communal storytelling experiences cinema on the big screen is more than a business it is an art form that brings people together celebrating humanity enhancing our empathy for one another  its one of the very last artistic inperson collective experiences we share as human beings once the pandemic is over theaters will be filled again with film lovers that is my strong belief not because the movie industry needs it but because we humans need cinema as a collective experience so just as i have both a fiduciary and creative responsibility to fulfill as the filmmaker i call on att to act swiftly with the same responsibility respect and regard to protect this vital cultural medium economic impact to stakeholders is only one aspect of corporate social responsibility finding ways to enhance culture is another the movie going experience is like no other in those darkened theaters films capture our history educate us fuel our imagination and lift and inspire our collective spirit it is our legacy long live theatrical cinema    you heard the mango out and see it oh and im going to give dune an a
Oct 29 2021,positive,this remake of the original movie showed only half of the story linedisappointed but action effects were good i wanted to see how paul grew from a boy to man and then to rule the galaxy
Oct 29 2021,positive,the movie was set up well but too long
Oct 29 2021,positive,the world the world building the characters just everything is amazing the visuals and sound design is made for imax and it is amazing the production design is amazing the costumes the scenery everything is awesome everything about this movie just feels epic i was completely engulfed into the world and so it was kind of an unsatisfying end it ended and i was kind of shocked there wasnt more i understand its part one of the series but it didnt really complete this story and if they didnt end up making more parts it would make this movie disappointing the acting is great timothee chalamet and rebecca ferguson absolutely kill it and no one feels out of place there are a few gimmicky parts but they really didnt take me out of the movie i never read the book but felt like everything was pretty easy to follow and they did a good job of explaining most things this is a 2 hour 35 minute movie and i felt like i was in there for maybe 15 hours it went so fast 100 recommend to anybody especially scifi fans
Oct 29 2021,positive,it was good  see a sequel coming
Oct 29 2021,positive,beautiful acting music and cinematography
Oct 29 2021,positive,this is probably the first work i see being adapted for the screen with such ambition and determination although the result is not always what was expected     dune by dennis villeneuve is a very interesting and striking adaptation of the work of frank herbert it presents a beautiful cinematography with various visual spectacles while it sometimes lacks a more indepth script that connects us with the main characters there are scenes that i would have liked to see being passed from the book to the screen but unfortunately they didnt make it to the final cut the end of the film is a little anticlimactic but the relationship between story and time available is understandable     aside from these small aspects dennis has now started a morally and politically ambitious saga cant wait to catch up on upcoming movies
Oct 29 2021,negative,first movie i ever walked out of and saw several people sleeping in different isles very slow and plotting jason momas performance was the only lifting moments i cannot see how this got good reviews
Oct 29 2021,positive,great action  cast dont recall seeing og but would recommend
Oct 29 2021,positive,not as good as the original movie
Oct 29 2021,positive,slow burn story blow you out of the your seat visuals and sound
Oct 29 2021,neutral,beautiful visuals but impossible to hear most of the dialogue even with tv volume on max
Oct 29 2021,positive,beautiful cinematography with outstanding performances and a fantastic direction that captures the novel i cant wait to see part 2
Oct 29 2021,positive,excellent film cant wait for part 2
Oct 29 2021,negative,i didnt understand anything that happened and it kept going off in completely different directions half the movie is them walking through the desert
Oct 29 2021,positive,special effects great story it is a little long
Oct 29 2021,positive,the movie was awesome
Oct 29 2021,positive,grand in scope as it should be loved it
Oct 29 2021,positive,kept my attention the entire time very exciting
Oct 29 2021,negative,this was entertaining enough but nothing special  if youre a fan of big special effect movies that youve seen it all before go for it  and it does stay pretty close to the book  but if youre expecting great acting outside of jason momoa when they gave him a little chance dialogue and character development dont waste your time
Oct 29 2021,positive,absolutely fantastic movie  dennis perfectly captures the original material and a jaw dropping use of scale tension and cinematography    acting by the young stars chalamet and zendaya is spot on  i cannot wait for part two
Oct 29 2021,positive,so nice we saw it twicein one week havent read the full book but i definitely am able to go to the book with more understanding cant wait for the second so good
Oct 29 2021,positive,i really enjoy this movie i have never read dune the novel by frank herbert but this movie gave a sense of the world and history of dune  i was able to follow and understand the story  see it in imax  if you can because it is a great experience it is beautifully shot and you really believe this world could exist   villeneuve really creates a wonderful movie the score by hans zimmer is wonderful you can hear it and dont deter from the movie it is a compliment to it i can say that this is one better movie in acting fx music and story that i have seen in years  it was very enjoyable  i am looking forward to part ii
Oct 29 2021,positive,the score was fantastic character development excellent not reading the book i can tell the film has to focus on certain lanes over others due to how well the film was i am looking forward to the books
Oct 29 2021,negative,dune is nothing more than a soap opera which is trying to become a scifi movie the brakes between actions are long and boring the dialogue being as boring as it is is constantly interrupted by long vegan stairs which are supposed to be full of meaning but are just that long vacant stairs the dead time between even dialogue is offensively long the only people who like dune is people who like dune everybody else should stay away in droves
Oct 29 2021,positive,love the movie cant wait for the second part
Oct 29 2021,positive,excellent performances and terrific cgi and quite understandable compared to the 1980s version
Oct 29 2021,positive,saw this on the biggest sceen i could fine imax at the request of the director epic visuals emersive sound so glad i saw this on the big screen villeneuve has created a masterpiece that will certainly survive the test of time bring on part 2
Oct 29 2021,positive,never read the book not my type of film not my fave director certainly dont enjoy first instalments of epics butdespite taking a while to set the scene i thought it was decent and the scale of the sets is both ambitious and well executed the plot is hardly gripping pretty formulaic but makes up for it elsewhere and id like to see part two now
Oct 29 2021,positive,absolutely beautiful movie with grand scale the hans zimmer score is one of the most amazing things ive ever heard on that note though at times the music was too loud and overpowered the narrative including sound effects and dialogue i plan on watching it again with subtitles on to hopefully catch the things i missed
Oct 29 2021,negative,beautiful cinematography too long should not be considered for best picture or any above the line oscar categories crafts only
Oct 29 2021,negative,a film that will certainly not be for everyone the movie has good visuals acting and direction but the lack of characterization along with its slow burn pace with a somewhat complicated story makes the majority of the film an absolute borefest with its 2 and a half hour runtime wouldnt recommend for the average moviegoer but if you are a fan of the source material or like a slow film dune will most likely please you
Oct 29 2021,positive,its well acted great cinematography great music dont know about others but its an masterpiece for me
Oct 29 2021,negative,visually the movie is stunning but as far as pacing and story telling and even character development  its lacking it stays close to the books however watching this felt like i was reading the book again at 20 pages a minute a lot was left out the main characters   countless premonitions takes up a abusive majority of screen time and the all star cast them assembled for the film they get about 10 minutes of screen time seriously its just endless premonitions
Oct 29 2021,positive,beautiful cant wait for part 2 and many more
Oct 29 2021,positive,probably the best movie ive seen since 2019 having read the book multiple times this feels like a good adaptation to the book although missing some character interactions that wouldve made it more clear why certain things happened this wouldve undoubtedly added 15 to 20 minutes to the fill overall really and cant wait for part 2
Oct 29 2021,positive,outstanding adaptation of the original material the scope of the story the amazing designs and the unique sounds make this a must see for the imax rebecca ferguson knocks it out of the park with her portrayal of an incredibly complex character timothee embodies the essence of the conflict that paul faces
Oct 29 2021,negative,im sorry but i hated the movie the one star goes for good recording graphics and acting but the story and the developing was super bad i watched on cinema and i truly got bored and i slept
Oct 29 2021,negative,long and boring they really dont have a objectives
Oct 29 2021,positive,only saw one missing piece where a pivotal part of a pivotal scene was incomplete no spoilers here  overall i liked it and may actually go back to see it again on the big screen while it is still available
Oct 29 2021,positive,i read the first three books to prepare for this movie and it did not disappoint like the book the world building takes a bit but once youre caught up to speed dune delivers if theres one word for it its epic 
Oct 29 2021,positive,magnificent on the imax screen slow burn at first but villeneuve is building a masterpiece sweeping visuals insane soundtrack and the night battleomg the night battle this sets the stage for part 2 2023 cant get here soon enough this is why we go to the movies
Oct 29 2021,positive,great adaptation fantastic visuals and audio stayed as true to the book as you can get
Oct 29 2021,positive,loved this adaptation ibe read the entire series and this film has a beautiful pace and vision for the story cannot wait for part 2
Oct 29 2021,positive,dune was such an amazing movie easily one of my top favorite movies now i saw it in theaters and i am so glad i did because it looks and sounds mesmerizing it is definitely worth a theater trip the visuals were beautiful and of course hans zimmers score was perfection dune felt like a breath of fresh air in the world of action and scifi as the market has been saturated with superhero movies with the same formula i love superhero movies but its nice to watch something different it is a slower movie as its over two and a half hours long but the movie has a good pace for the amount of information that is given to the audience timothe chalamet is a really strong leading man in this movie and the rest of the cast is great too so glad that part 2 is confirmed because i know that its going to be just as awesome and maybe even better than this movie 100010 highly recommend
Oct 29 2021,positive,an instant modern classic filmed beautifully and director denis villeneuve does not let you fall behind or get confused on anything the most epic sci fi movie of the last 20 years
Oct 29 2021,positive,one of the best movies i have watched in quite a while visually it was breathtaking  the score made you feel like you were there and perfectly conveyed the emotions of each scene i went into this movie expecting to be disappointed but found myself even with the original playing in the back of my mind on the edge of my seat wanting to know what would happen next the presentation was fresh and original while at the same time creating links to the past from the top down this was extremely well done
Oct 29 2021,negative,boring  uninteresting characters the first time around in the 80s it was bad i should have known better than to watch it this time but the cast drew me in
Oct 29 2021,negative,it had ok special effects pretty good fight scenes but other wise it was the longest 2 and a half hours of my life and the movie isnt even half way through the story they spent too much time with the scenery shots and not enough plot time go see anything else
Oct 29 2021,negative,short review of dune 2021 part 1  the film is promising as an aid to insomniacs    long review  choice of actors was good atmosphere was good soundtrack was bad  this 2021 version of dune part 1 was obviously designed to put a person to sleep  for what reason would a person give this film a second viewing  one of the most memorable characters of the david lynch 1984 version of dune was the villain baron harkonnen but in this film the baron is a complete bore  sure some may criticize the 1984 baron as a comicbook villain but he absolutely could not be used as a sleepaid  the film was enjoyable to view in the same way it is enjoyable to view a field of daises but would a person watch it for 25 hours of course notand neither should you
Oct 29 2021,positive,yup its a great scifi movie the next star wars and the lord of the rings is here overall its perfect
Oct 29 2021,positive,fantastic i didnt want it to end and cant wait for the next one
Oct 29 2021,positive,cinematically stunning it sets the stage for an epic ending in part 2
Oct 29 2021,positive,visually captivating havent personally read the book but was able to follow along soundtrack wasnt mixed well however music was at 13 while dialog was at 8 made for ear piercing sections of sound in the theater very uncomfortable and pulls you out of the immersion
Oct 29 2021,positive,special effects were fabulous  a bit hard to follow but it helps to read reviews prior to watching  fast moving but quite dark  all in all a very good movie
Oct 29 2021,negative,looks like a great movie but it is very hard to catch on it is confusing enough that you wont know exactly what is going on it has a very good casting and good effects but thats it we had to leave the movie theater early because it was pointless to watch something we couldnt catch up as a regular audience i wish we could have our money back
Oct 29 2021,positive,soundtrack over the top loud and intrusive in most scenes early scenes were great but then devolved into cartoon battle and chase scenes overall meh
Oct 29 2021,positive,visually stunning  takes a bit to figure out the rules of the universe  some good acting  ending is oddly incomplete  kind of seems like the intermission before part 2
Oct 29 2021,positive,this movie is a masterpiece and im looking forward to seeing more
Oct 29 2021,positive,a perfect adaptation of the book happy they did not squeeze the whole book into one film a must see
Oct 29 2021,positive,i like star wars a lot and this movie was awesome not just the story the cgi was perfect
Oct 29 2021,positive,amazing best scifi movie ive seen since the original bladerunner
Oct 29 2021,negative,tedious kept looking at my watch to see when it would be finished
Oct 29 2021,positive,good but not great mostly long dramatic shots and overbearing music some that obscures dialog thin plot exposition most everything is implied through how magnanimously this movie is presented the baron is boring pretentiously art house minimal meaning through the grandeur
Oct 29 2021,positive,i think this movie is amazing i love everything in this movie and the soundtrack was so good i cant wait for part two
Oct 29 2021,positive,amazing you have to see it
Oct 29 2021,positive,those who read the books will find no need to wince the cast gave powerful performances top to botton the cinematography was visually stunning and the score intergration flawless
Oct 29 2021,positive,this is the best cinematic version of this tale ever produced  it is visually stunning and reminds me visually of lawrence of arabia  i cannot wait for the second part of the film
Oct 29 2021,positive,awesome great timeless effects and true to the storyline 
Oct 29 2021,positive,they manage to find the balance between providing enough world building  character development without the moving feeling slow each character is superbly cast and i cant wait until the next one
Oct 29 2021,positive,this is filmmaking and its best seriously brilliant in all areas fantastic
Oct 29 2021,positive,dune offers a more than pleasing experience in which every shot fits beautifully in the bigger picture sitting in the cinema it is more than easy to fully immerse in the shown world only the very sudden and open ending is able to bring the audience back to reality
Oct 29 2021,positive,it was beautiful to see my favourite childhood novel adapted well to the big screen i cant wait for the sequel
Oct 29 2021,positive,after quite a while do we have a movie where the cgi grandiose environments are being used to actually tell a story rather than trap the viewer in the high fidelity viewing experience like so many marvel movies have done villeneuve makes a very original and successful attempt to be true to the art of storytelling and not losing the plot amongst cool dialogues and star power     one of the few sagas which will make it worth the wait after avatar
Oct 29 2021,positive,i really the the cinematography of the movie everything felt  so real i could feel that world of dune is so large which made me to start reading the book
Oct 29 2021,negative,the music was loud making the dustcovered scenery ominous  i was thirsty during all the dustcovered scenes  i had no idea what was going on throughout the film  a patron who read all the books complained that the film didnt go according to the books  i dont like to have to read a book to understand a film  thumbs down
Oct 29 2021,positive,beautiful movie overall although didnt feel like a full movie 2 hrs 30 for an underwhelming stand alone movie idk very excited for part 2
Oct 29 2021,positive,amazing movie will for sure read the book now
Oct 29 2021,positive,excellent film scifi for adults  satisfying ended the movie at the right moment the story is far from over
Oct 29 2021,negative,overly long overly complicated profoundly boring just like the book
Oct 29 2021,positive,beautiful movie excellent adaptation of the book cant wait for the act2
Oct 29 2021,positive,while a long movie once the story gets going it keeps you entertained so you dont notice how long it was if part two is done as well it will be a classic
Oct 29 2021,positive,a bit long and i went blind several times
Oct 29 2021,positive,beautiful version of dune breaking the story into two parts allows time to tell the story effectively  excellent casting fantastic special effects i cant wait for part 2
Oct 29 2021,positive,captivating im not a scifi movie fan and i loved this movie incredible acting cinematography and story this is a must see movie  i can not wait for the sequel
Oct 29 2021,positive,absolutely incredible film the cinematography sound design acting art direction denis villeneuve has crafted an epic masterpiece its been years since the entire audience clapped at the credits i couldnt be more excited for the sequel denis brought back the magic of cinema see this in imax or dont see it all all youre doing yourself a disservice if you view it any other way kudos to this amazing film
Oct 29 2021,positive,phenomenal sci fi film the visuals the worlds dennis created the story the amazing cast tells hans mfn zimmer might dethrone interstellar as the generational best sci fi film watch in theaters for best experience
Oct 29 2021,positive,great adaptation of the book beautifully filmed and scored excellent cast with good character development epic scifi film for the ages
Oct 29 2021,positive,ive been waiting for 40 years for a good movie rendition of dune i was not disappointed by villeneuves production the cast acting scenery and sound track are all superb the movie follows the book very closely a must for fans of the books my only complaint a major draw of the dune saga is the incredibly complex interacting story lines and the numerous layers of plots within plots the movie omitted or abbreviated most of these i understand the time constraints but i would have eagerly watched a 6hour version of dune part 1
Oct 29 2021,positive,i think it would be hard for people to follow if they hadnt read the book its overly long as well
Oct 29 2021,positive,liked  special effects jason momma development of story line  disliked  harsh musical score didnt realize it was a part one
Oct 29 2021,positive,need to read the book to understand whats going on
Oct 29 2021,negative,a movie that should be as epic like lord or the rings avatar star wars felt extremely short even if this was the frist 3 chapters of a tv series  dune is not in the game of throne level this     the main character chamalet must give the audience all kind if emotions instead of just a lazy face in all circumstances     momoa acting is the same here than in aquaman and the same in conan    the director fails to understand the complexity of a movie based on a book of this epicness  just because it has a lot of big great takes does not mean is a good movie if the soul of the movie is so ambiguous as chamalet face and reactions     i understand villeneuve wants to maintain his style of filming but this is also selfish to a great scifi novel     majority of critics aclaims it but sometimes i wonder if this is cause some other thing involved in their opinions if we analyze this movie opened lower than halloween kills lower than no time to die lower than venom lower than shang chi but some people are trying to fool that was a good opening weekend imagine if star wars star trek the hobbit would opened with this numbers and nooo it is not because of covid cause some other titles opened higher and not this kind if blockbuster     for me this movie is a failure wrapped in a fancy envelope
Oct 29 2021,neutral,if youre patient then this is a solid foundation for the potential franchise however this movie takes a very long time to go anywhere and it is confusing to follow if you didnt read the books a visual treat
Oct 29 2021,positive,i am 79 and a little hard of hearing  were they speaking alien languages or just mumbling  i only got about 13 of the dialogue  the rest of the movie is great  you can follow the story pretty well by just watching  i will go to see the 2nd one if its ever made
Oct 29 2021,negative,the movie was too long many times the dialogue was not discernable and the plot was muddled and unclear i saw the movie in the imax with only 20 people in the audience for the 6 pm showing the sound was good and the visuals like the helicopters were unique as were the battleships rising up from the sand and the fight scenes were good i dont think the casting was good for the young hero and was not believable
Oct 29 2021,positive,excellent film went into this with some pretty high expectations and it certainly did not disappoint very much looking forward to the other parts
Oct 29 2021,positive,must see beautiful lyrical philosophical with giant spaceships and cool effects massive fan cant wait for part two three four
Oct 29 2021,negative,disappointing that dune fell right into the white savior trope presented by frank herbert the movie was not a criticism of the western man but squarely put him in the middle of it all as the messiah who will save all the brown fremen
Oct 29 2021,positive,one of the best films ive seen in recent years the cinematography is outstanding truly a small part of a grand masterpiece
Oct 29 2021,positive,beautiful moving magnificent
Oct 29 2021,positive,dune felt like a movie thats a part of a giant world full of alliances and lore if i were to compare it to anything it felt like a scifi lord of the rings each shot had so much style and all of the acting was stellar i cant wait to see where the story goes spiceforall
Oct 29 2021,positive,solid cinematography and top notch acting entertained beginning to end
Oct 29 2021,positive,alejandro jodorowsky must be jealous  dennis achieved what he could not  give dune life  i cant wait for the next movie
Oct 29 2021,positive,inspiring cinematography looking forward to the next one 
Oct 29 2021,positive,visually thrilling with epic cinematography dune is a fantastic tale perfectly well based in its fantastic source material this film will remain as a masterpiece for generations to come thanks to the perfection of denis villenueve
Oct 29 2021,positive,absolutely amazing must see in theatres the sound design alone is unforgettable visuals are true to the scale and intensity of the dune story which is also told in dramatic fashion 5 stars easy
Oct 29 2021,positive,great action story and acting 
Oct 29 2021,positive,amazing need a part 2
Oct 29 2021,positive,amazing visuals amazing acting and plot amazing all around
Oct 29 2021,positive,unlike many i was a fan of the first movie even though it was very abridged the first installment of this adaptation was a joy to watch and i like the longer story development and background there are a few slower sections but they add depth to the characters and build into later parts of the story really looking forward to the next installment
Oct 29 2021,positive,i like it why this awesome love it forget 1984 dune this dune 2021 look like starwars but awesome
Oct 29 2021,positive,i dont know what to say other than i was underwhelmed   casting was hit or miss and diminished the film and rebecca ferguson was the worst of the lot  the flow of the film was noticeably uneven where they could have taken the time to expand ideas they sped through then spent countless minutes on throwaway scenes such as climbing the desert sands  it wasnt a bad movie however it was not what i had expected let alone good not in a rush to watch part two
Oct 29 2021,positive,excellent cast giving depth of character and chemistry  well worth seeing on the big screen
Oct 29 2021,positive,fantastic i just wish it didnt end halfway cant wait until part 2
Oct 29 2021,neutral,special effects and some of the action was alright but the dialogue and acting was really bad for a lot of the movie
Oct 29 2021,negative,long slow lacked a storyline made no sense  acting was pathetic
Oct 29 2021,positive,a sight for sore eyes a great movie in a time of crap coming out of hollywood
Oct 29 2021,positive,watched the movie without having read the book was blown away entranced the entire time immediately went out and bought the book cant wait for the 2nd movie
Oct 29 2021,negative,slow pace and racist imagery even though the story shifts where the movie stopped casting could have been less racist in the wake of major xenophobia in our country 210 visually it was nice
Oct 29 2021,positive,very well put together with great special effects
Oct 29 2021,positive,exceptional cinematic experience  visually incredible with a dark thoughtful mood it does justice to the classic book from which it is based eagerly awaiting part 2
Oct 29 2021,positive,amazing visuals deep world building and a captivating mix of religious and political themes make this film fantastic i was engaged for the entire 2 12 hours this is what scifi should be marvel movies feel horribly bland in comparison go see it
Oct 29 2021,positive,good adaptation of the novel   clean and it flowed  great casting
Oct 29 2021,positive,the flow of the story line and the special effects
Oct 29 2021,positive,great movie an acting
Oct 29 2021,positive,faithful to the book  full of easter eggs for the sticklers  but well paced and edited to keep the story coherent effectively cast with actors who sometimes have to make the most of a few lines and beautifully filmed and scored
Oct 29 2021,positive,epic in scope ambition and execution dune is the rare adaption thats improved by the liberties it takes with the source material
Oct 29 2021,positive,slow pace in the beginning of the moviea little confusing  you should read the book  to fill in some of the story line love the cast and the main character  i will see the sequel
Oct 29 2021,negative,everything was great except for the story what a crazy unacceptable story
Oct 29 2021,negative,was good but did not so book justice
Oct 29 2021,positive,its ok slow but visually stunning
Oct 29 2021,negative,im truly shocked by the number of people who actually like this garbage its an almost 3 hour movie that doesnt even have a satisfying ending but a cliffhanger so it could end in a second movie to me thats the laziest way to end a movie to end a movie and if you want to make a sequel make it ambiguous and so the audience that say oh whats next but also think dang thats it and make them believe thats the end but then secretly have a sequel that the pacing was very slow and i legit wanted to fall asleep due to its long long runtime ive never seen the original 1980 something dune but now i want to to see if its somewhat better than this garbage the acting is very bland and not really anything its just monotone nonsense i get that this movie was attempting to be the next big franchise but in my eyes this is not it but i am surprised by how many people actually enjoy this movie maybe because of this whole lockdown thing people have no taste i dont know but i have no clue how people could last 3 hours in a theater im so glad this was on hbo max and i could barely make it through the first hour and 45 minutes after that i had to take a break aka 2 hours to then have the patience to sit through the rest in the end this movie couldve been something with better acting better writing and thats it this movie looks like a huge spectacle i bet warner brothers spent a lot of money on this and it shows the only compliment i could give this movie is it looks fantastic but unfortunately this movie doesnt amount to anything and will be in the 5 bin at walmart either this black friday or the next year after that if they ever make a dune part 2 ill possibly scream but not in joy but rather in anger a little joke at the end anyway hopefully another movie never happens but maybe it could hollywood is full of surprises
Oct 29 2021,neutral,not enough content in the movie  ended abruptly  sound was bad too much whispering  cant tell what they said and music and background action noises bleed over the voices
Oct 29 2021,positive,as someone who knew nothing about dune going into this this is awesome the scope and spectacle alone is worth it the cast is amazing and the music please see in imax a blockbuster in every sense of the word
Oct 29 2021,positive,wow i love this movie
Oct 29 2021,positive,complex characters fabulous costumes  sets incredible music
Oct 29 2021,positive,true to the books  a must see on the big screen and the score is magnificent  love it
Oct 29 2021,positive,i thought the movie was excellent i hope that there will be sequels as frank herbert wrote 5 dune books my only complaint is about the theater as the volume was almost uncomfortably loud
Oct 29 2021,positive,visuals and music are incredible must see on the big screen
Oct 29 2021,positive,brilliant cinematography terrific music great acting and at last a worthy screen adaptation of the classic novel  im very glad that i saw it in the theater  the vistas and sounds were much better than they would have been at home
Oct 29 2021,positive,this movie bring me new fandom for me love it acting sci fi  never seen 80s movie or read book love this new movie so good  everything a 1010  watch it on my 75ich tv 4k still good
Oct 29 2021,positive,it does start kind of slow but this is a top 10 of all movies ive seen and one of the very best scifi movies out there special effects are fantastic and realistic acting is very good as well excellent movie cant wait for part 2
Oct 29 2021,negative,slow boring and confusing
Oct 29 2021,positive,excellent moviefollows the book well wonderful theaterlovely date
Oct 29 2021,positive,wowowowowow ok so slowburn start but just a beautiful movie to watch great acting and the action scenes were epic
Oct 28 2021,positive,the visuals and special effects were very well done however the sound was way too loud sometimes the background sound and poor enunciation made the dialogue difficult to understand at times
Oct 28 2021,positive,as a fan of the books i do feel that some very important scenes are sorely needed to expand on a character pivotal to the plot in this movie that being said dune is a one of a kind cinematic experience imax is the way to go for this movie the cast is spectacular
Oct 28 2021,positive,great esoteric story and in keeping with the book loved it
Oct 28 2021,positive,loved it so much such a good movie cant wait for part ii
Oct 28 2021,positive,formidable scale and heft unseen in mainstream hollywood in quite some time unwieldy without an ending and occasionally cold perhaps the fullness of the achievement will reveal itself with part 2 though i doubt anything to come will get rid of the sense that chalamet and zendaya are playing dressup
Oct 28 2021,positive,timothee was the best choice to bring paul atreides to life the entire cast of this huge movie is amazing cant wait for the sequel
Oct 28 2021,positive,visual effects were stunning and the casting was good
Oct 28 2021,positive,i cant begin to explain how this first half does justice to what many have called an impossible feat only denis could make such a beautiful and captivating rendition of the book however this is definitely a film made for fans of the novels as those who are not well versed in dune will come away with a hundred questions but sometimes thats okay
Oct 28 2021,negative,absolute shit i finger blasted my dog instead
Oct 28 2021,positive,it took my head a bit to get around the plots but it was amazing cant wait for the next one
Oct 28 2021,negative,my boredom is palpable  i turned it off about 15 hours in  this has all the heartless boring contrivances of many contemporary big budget action movies  the pompous regality is really annoying  dune 2021 is a visual work of art but it has no human soul whatsoever for me   im either overwhelmed by the events of real life the past year and a half or im just too old for this kind of drivel  i like good human stories and this is just another fictional glob that takes itself too seriously  its highly unlikely that ill finish it  i wanted to like it however bore me to death why dont ya
Oct 28 2021,positive,as with any book of this density changes were required  and as always some work some do not  the amount that doesnt work though is rare  this is an excellent adaptation of the first part of this story  looking forward to part 2
Oct 28 2021,positive,has to be watched on a big screen with exceptional system in imax if possible
Oct 28 2021,positive,fantastic acting jaw dropping scenery and absolutely marvelous music it will be multiple oscar winner for sure
Oct 28 2021,positive,long but the good parts make it worth it 
Oct 28 2021,positive,hard to understand at times
Oct 28 2021,positive,very close adaptation to original bruce herbert dune book 1 i highly recommend it to any and all true scifi fans
Oct 28 2021,positive,i have not read the books and found the movie easy to follow they built the plot slowly enough to get to know the players but not so slowly that the movie dragged i thought they hit a good medium and i really enjoyed the movie looking forward to the next one
Oct 28 2021,positive,i enjoy denis villenueves films and when i learned he was making an adaptation of dune i was very excited upon finally seeing it im not disappointed in the slightest its fantastic for fans and still made well for those who are unfamiliar with the book its a genuine cinematic treat
Oct 28 2021,positive,overall a different take and perspective on the dune book very little scenes and lines copied over from first movie which if you are a fan will undoubtedly you will compare with however the major events are still there i prefer this harkonnen as a better representation of the persona in the book lady jessica does cry a bit more than you would expect from the bg guild love the designs of the vehicles  especially the ornithopters need to get one  and the other sets also some of the background on the atreides house you really have to shrug off the first movie characters to embrace the new ones they do actually a really great job in their respective roles once you do it makes for a great movie still sad about duncan apples and oranges between the two movies i have to say that i am loving this one cant wait for the next one i will be jumping as excited as a 10 year old for christmas yes must see
Oct 28 2021,positive,imagine giving this movie a bad ratingi get not being intelligent enough to follow plot points but the film was anything but dull     fantastic adaptation of a very challenging book great music acting and visuals
Oct 28 2021,positive,we loved everything about this movie  graphics wonderful
Oct 28 2021,positive,as someone who know the books i will say this was a real treat for the eyes met and exceeded my expectations i could only wish for more of it
Oct 28 2021,negative,mostly violence way too long people were walking out
Oct 28 2021,positive,i am only giving this 5 stars so to promote something that different going against marvel monopoly in the movie market however this is film is actually a 35 for me mainly because of the slow pacing lack emotional character development soulless spice addition and poor story choices    poor choices are made and changed in this movie because the writers and director did not read and understand all the dune books perhaps the producers as well    1 there was civil war with airobots before dune story starts all the machines like ships are run by 2 race of sub human creatures the mentats and the navigator it appear that regular humans they could be mentats were driving ships in this movie on top of that there was 1 scene of autopilot being turned on which makes zero sense in the dune world because there is a technophobia feeling that are missing in this movie because prequel robot civil war only navigators and mentats can use machinesships the religious theme is shown here in the background but religious dialogue and symbols such as the cross are cut back as well the spice is like an drugpower addiction and there no mention of this in the movie you have zero sense that people are getting emotional of the spice addiction like alcoholic going through withdrawal or emotionalphysical abuse    2 the woke culture has been applied to most of the fremen i think all or most of them are black and brown people there is at least 1 gender swap here as well from the book which i have no problem here about this however i am making assumption here is creators of this dune movie thought that the fremen are the heroes of dune and that what it may seem in the 1st dune book but spoiler alert in the future books the fremen group become the fascist evil and a dictatorship in supporting god emperor through the golden path destroying every other group in the universe so whoever thought this was a good idea to promote this was likely by accident in which they are painting the possible future where the black and brown people are essentially evil    3 there is no classic fun cheesy or extreme moments like in cult favorite 1984 movie there no fun cheesy lines to have fun with its like taking out all fun lines out of the original star war james bond or indian jones there is no meme to have here this feels like a generic action cgi remakereboot movie just like robocop total recall ghostbusters or the mummy    we got so many so called  positive reviewers located here in rotten tomatoes but i think most of those reviewers have not seen the good old scffi movies or read the dune books there is so many bad scifi movies in our last generation that alot of people have now forgotten all good scifi movies from the 60s 70s 80s 90s etc some other people here are only liking this movie because of the wokeness it has in the background of the story some people here only gave positive reviews here because they are sick of the superhero genre  the only issues i have with 1984 movie are some effects are out of date and there slight changes to movies the changes in this 2021 are way larger and more tone deaf to the book than 1984 version to me the definitive version of dune will be 1984 one even if it was not perfect
Oct 28 2021,positive,dune was big with images and the sound track was outstanding  the plot was ho hum and the end disappointing for 25 hours
Oct 28 2021,positive,i first read dune when in high school in 1973 was highly disappointed in david lynch dune movie they should burn it the new release of dune is very close to the book with some changes i was on the edge of seat for entire movie cant wait for part 2
Oct 28 2021,positive,denis villeneuves signature slow pacing and subdued acting is present all throughout with dune there is an intention to entertain the audience even if the decisions are sometimes misguided the inability to cram all the dense material into one movie is understandable but i am definitely left hungry for more with the openendedness of the closing scenes all in all i cant bring myself to hate dune even if i tried i loved it so much its a masterful film full of technical excellence acting prowess visual spectacle and rich worldbuilding but this film will be entirely incomplete and wasted if the entire story ends where it does we are relying on a sequel to complete the legend denis villeneuve is setting out to tell and things are just getting started
Oct 28 2021,positive,cant eat for the second movie it was close enough to the books to be happy
Oct 28 2021,positive,effects pacing casting and script were on point this is the best movie ive seen in years this will be an oscar sweep
Oct 28 2021,positive,needed more alien type characters
Oct 28 2021,positive,it was never boring and the soundtrack was phenomenal
Oct 28 2021,negative,basically just watched 2 hours of people running through the desert save your time and just skip the first one you could definitely see the second one without watching this one
Oct 28 2021,positive,first of all this version of dune seemed to be much closer to the book then the 1984 version had been secondly the special effects were fabulous the way that the movie portrayed the bene gesserit weirding voice had an otherworldly quality to it that made it seem very powerful     if they had chosen a somewhat more mature actor to portray paul atreides the role might have been a bit more believable     for the most part though i loved it and can hardly wait until the next movie comes out im anxious to see how the are going to show paul drinking the water of life
Oct 28 2021,positive,i was so glad to see that this movie conveyed the feel of the book great job
Oct 28 2021,positive,absolutely must see if youre a fan of the genre or anyone involved in the film a visual and auditory feast cant wait for the next part if denis villeneuve is directing
Oct 28 2021,positive,what a refreshing change of pace from all these marvel and dc movies
Oct 28 2021,positive,brilliant film very true to the book cant wait for the second part
Oct 28 2021,positive,dune is cinematic gold when it comes to all aspects with the direction of thee excellent denis villeneuve he brings dune to life with his cinematography and score and story along with a stellar cast which also brings all the characters to life
Oct 28 2021,positive,as good as it gets except it ends when its about to start
Oct 28 2021,positive,great movie just dont hit my expectations
Oct 28 2021,negative,read the books probably 30 years ago  may have read them again more recently   saw the 1984 film saw the jodorovsky documentary its the same story  since diversity is the most important aspect of life the film is diverse in its casting i dont have an particular complaints about actor selection   the film itself i found to be best viewed at 15x speed maybe 5 of the film was best at normal speed  the film is long exceptionally slow and only covers half the book i found nothing of exceptional value interest or entertainment the ocean scenes were very nice some of the desert look jarringly unreal meh
Oct 28 2021,positive,that we have to wait 2 years for part two
Oct 28 2021,positive,where did the weirding module go  i feel thats a key piece of why the fremen needed paul to win the war  and the original film made it so much easier to follow the story  by hearing the thoughts of each character as the story progressed   in addition the director should have made the script contain less whispers  its impossible to hear the key lines of the script   i was so excited for this film and left disappointed
Oct 28 2021,positive,dune is without a doubt one of the biggest epics that ive ever seen timothée chalamet gives a very worthy first blockbuster performance and the rest of the cast does an excellent job its also pretty intense and the scenery is a sight to behold this film demands to be seen in a theater on the largest screen possible it wont have the same impact elsewhere i highly recommend this one
Oct 28 2021,positive,ill be concise its beautiful well thought out and the director built this universe out very well without drowning the viewers in data there were changes from the books yes but they were reasonable and did nothing to change the story or the flow of time there were a few minor issues but these are nitpicks and not really worth the time to critique
Oct 28 2021,positive,stunning virtually everything was amazing from the actors including the delicious cameo from charlotte rampling to the landscapes and the effects i was so involved with the story that i was shocked when the film ended the hours seemed to pass so quickly cannot wait for part 2
Oct 28 2021,positive,i read the book 5 times i saw this movie on hbo and then 2 days later in the theater big screen is better but as always its the story that got me to read the book so many times and this movie does a great job of conveying the essence of the characters and story so far so good lets hope they do the same with the rest of the story
Oct 28 2021,positive,i loved it t got me hooked so bad that i have to read the books now
Oct 28 2021,positive,dune part i has already been called lawrence of arabia meets the lord of the rings and star wars for adults the film doesnt disappoint and hopefully is just the beginning of the next great scifi franchise it is epic cinema best enjoyed on the largest screen possible     dune part i is a stunning table setter that covers the first part of frank herberts initial complex story one that has gone on to spawn 20 more novels and counting it is the appetizer for the planned trilogy feast that director denis villeneuve will continue with dune part ii and conclude with herberts second novel dune messiah     herberts first 3 dune novels were his original planned trilogy that concluded with children of dune i could easily envision that trilogy as an eventual 5movie package with children of dune also being split into 2 films like his first novel hopefully villeneuve will direct those last two as well thereby coming full circle with paul atreides as he hands the reigns to his son leto ii the god emperor
Oct 28 2021,positive,i liked the film very much however  ive read the book i think it might be confusing for anyone who hasnt  i recommend that you at least read a detailed synopsis before watching the movie  also watching on a big screen is definitely the best idea for this movie
Oct 28 2021,positive,great visual effects and sound good story
Oct 28 2021,positive,they nailed it in every way cast cinematography effects pace etc im always careful not to oversell a movie but i dont think thats possible with this one
Oct 28 2021,positive,i thought it was going to be like tremors in outerspace but its  way more than just about big worms on another planet
Oct 28 2021,negative,slow flat and only told about 14 for the dune story  considering it had some many expansive and active scenes the 3d was not great
Oct 28 2021,positive,good things the scenery and music is spectacular some scenes took my breath away it looks as epic as i imagined it to be  it also follows the novel pretty nicely  bad things it feels kinda empty it could use a little more details and imagination most of the characters are underused and its hard to feel emotionally involved with them or the story an exception is oscar isaacs leto atreides
Oct 28 2021,positive,epic and very well laid out some may feel its slow but it hit all the scifi buttons for me
Oct 28 2021,positive,best movie of the year best adaptation im a fan of the book best casting
Oct 28 2021,positive,fantastic movie more entertaining than any other movie ive seen in 2 years
Oct 28 2021,positive,it was all that i had anticipated and more already excited about part 2 well worth the effort
Oct 28 2021,positive,good movie great set pieces excellent pacing and writing    but holy crap was the music too loud i get that most movies have the dialogue at 8 and the music at 11 but for whatever reason whoever mixed this movie decided to keep the dialogue at 8 and pump the music to 15 it was actually painful at parts
Oct 28 2021,positive,got to say this one took me by surprise with a fresh and interesting plot and a whole lot of immersive cinematography i can confidently say this is one of the best science fiction movies to come out in a while every actor or actress plays their part well so no complaints there i think the main part that holds the movie back is the convoluted dialogue and slow pace definitely worth a second watch after doing a deep dive into the plot of the novel
Oct 28 2021,positive,you had better believe that i went to see this movie on opening night i read the book years ago and so i was very excited for this movie to come out and it did not disappoint everything about it was incredible this is a truly epic film
Oct 28 2021,neutral,very long and confusing  im guessing this movie is for people who have read the books
Oct 28 2021,positive,easily the best movie ever made i cant wait for the sequel
Oct 28 2021,positive,its been years since i read the book the film has made a big of effort into trying to capture the feel of book and the story but is a very serious film but found a bit slow in places for me but well worth a watch
Oct 28 2021,negative,i had high expectations and they were not met regardless of this movie having a great cast i couldnt keep up with what was going on a lot of scenes i could hardly hear what they were saying was incredibly slow  honestly was dozing off the last part of the movie was very confusing and was the only action in the movie for those of us who have not read the books the movie started as if we should already know the characters and their status which made it even more hard to keep up with
Oct 28 2021,positive,as visually stunning and tonally accurate as one could envision a dune adaption to be the acting is exceptional direction is done to perfection and the screen is filled with some of the most beautiful imagery every captured on film even the slow parts are necessary in order to flesh out these beautifully crafted characters i was not a fan of lynchs muddled original however this masterpiece of filmmaking made me excited for the next chapter of a film saga i wasnt expecting to enjoy this much 910
Oct 28 2021,positive,special effects were great if you had not seen the first dune the current story is  bit confusion not a lot of ends to some of the plots  i believe that is because ther will be sequals
Oct 28 2021,negative,sorry fell asleep it felt so chopped up couldnt keep track of what who where 
Oct 28 2021,positive,as a huge fan of frank herberts book and work i am extremely happy with the film so happy that i watched it twice i cant wait for part ii
Oct 28 2021,negative,pretty boring movie most of the way through the story is incredibly hard to follow and the audio work is horrible theres one scene where theres an echo effect so exaggerated that you cant tell what theyre saying because their words are overlapping each other we get a small scene at the beginning for exposition on the setting of the world and thats it the movie plays out like youre expected to already know who everyone is and how their hierarchy works     a lot of suspenseful scenes are rather dull and boring too the movie is incredibly long 2 and a half hours and feels especially padded out at the end for run time theres also little to no buildup to action scenes and towards the end theres a fight scene that happens for seemingly no reason seriously everyone seemed friendly or rather tolerant towards each other then suddenly theres a massive fight between them seemingly out of nowhere     movie doesnt do a very good job making sure you the viewer know whats going on and making sure you know who everyone is i probably wont be seeing part 2
Oct 28 2021,positive,truly a spectacle an immersive experience
Oct 28 2021,negative,lackluster remake     say what you will about david lynch he knew how to make science fiction look good say what you will about dennis v he definitely does not sets costumes characters effects all show a distinct lack of imagination this film is as slow and plodding as the novel theyre doing the hobbit thing and splitting it up into multiple films unnecessarily so book purists will be happy line delivery is so uninspired i thought the cast was sleepwalking most of the time great actors are given almost nothing to do it will probably spawn a ton of sequels unfortunately
Oct 28 2021,positive,spends more time building a world and story than delivering one bad pacing for a movie really all over the place and does not stand on its own if multiple films are the intention forces the feeling of epic into each scene with its generic bwammm soundtrack while the scenes are not epic in their own merit it becomes laughable at scenes that are really insignificant and likely would have benefited from more natural character dialogue than massive bass lines id wait until whatever comes out next to see this movie
Oct 28 2021,positive,absolutely encompasses the spirit of the book and does a splendid job of building a story given the constraints of the media it lives in
Oct 28 2021,negative,incredibly slow and boring  this sjw pc  version alters plot and characters for liberal reasons  the acting of the lead is like watching dough rise the original dune is so much better and truer to the book that its hard to believe they made this dreck avoid unless you need sleep badly
Oct 28 2021,positive,dune is visually spectacular and does a fantastic job adhering to the herberts original story it can be kind of slow and overly loud in certain parts but overall dune is a great introduction to the universe and sets up the franchise as a whole for several future movies
Oct 28 2021,negative,phew denis villeneuve should stick to making original productions like arrival or sicario he does not have the stature or the talent to touch cult films like blade runner or dune dune is cold without soul and depth it could be a valid artistic choice but here it is a dismal failure i got bored throughout the movie and couldnt wait for it to end
Oct 28 2021,positive,great cinematography and acting by timothy chalemet the overall movie was at masterpiece level and cgi was out of the park as well as the incredible story
Oct 28 2021,negative,boring but nice audio effects and music
Oct 28 2021,positive,not sure what all the hype is about visually the movie is stunning throughout the movie you really feel a sense of scale of the world around the characters i think some of the scenery shots did linger a bit too long but thats not a big deal the score by hans zimmer is also very well done once they finally got to some action it was well done casting was allaround solid and i had no gripes with the acting    now for what i didnt like this movie is so boring i hardly ever start dozing off on the first watch of a movie looking at you jurassic world 2  fantastic beasts 2 but i did during this movie hardly anything happens in the first hour and a half of this movie yet with all that exposition i still didnt understand everything as well as i felt i should have reasons for rivalries and betrayals werent explained very well and often when something was finally being explained the characters were speaking so quietly i missed half the conversation its quite obvious that this is just setup for part 2 i know thats the point but a movie should be entertaining enough to stand on its own    im not saying not to watch the movie but i certainly wont be rewatching this and i doubt ill watch the sequel if this has happened to sway you off of watching dune im sorry go watch the last duel instead its a great movie
Oct 28 2021,positive,amazing dune has to be enjoyed on the big screen
Oct 28 2021,positive,brilliant mesmerizing a masterpiece captures not just the characters and the story but the atmosphere the nuance
Oct 28 2021,positive,awesome adaptation of the book from a book series perspective everything in this movie is perfect the only downside is that people who are not familiar with the story find it difficult to follow the movie
Oct 28 2021,positive,its really well done  special effects are ridiculously good  really really loud  like probably the loudest movie i have ever seen and i am 12 deaf  not happy to wait until 2023 for part 2  is part 2 the end  i think i need to watch it on hbo max with the subtitles on as there is a lot of background dialog that is near impossible to make out at least for me  its a long movie so dont drink much
Oct 28 2021,positive,fantastic film part 1 its a breath of fresh air amongst the deluge of mediocre superhero films that are constantly churned out by hollywood after a quick buck the story was engaging and the characters compelling im very much looking forward to the next installment in the series
Oct 28 2021,positive,beautiful excitingsome scenes dragged still one of the best films of the year
Oct 28 2021,positive,extraordinary direction and cinematography a brilliant script that takes the cumbersome source material and brings it alive with an excellent show dont tell approach to deeply complex world building great casting and acting especially rebecca ferguson as lady jessica    i love villeneuves emotionally distant and austere sensibility more at work here than even bladerunner 2049 or other previous works this is not a film that cares if the audience embraces it only that they are swept away and i appreciate that artistry      the only reason this isnt five stars is that it is half a movie im fine with that and eagerly awaiting the continuation not sequel but on its own it is incomplete that the majority of audience reviews are forgiving of this is impressive
Oct 28 2021,positive,better than i expected i thought it would be long and semi boring but easy to follow along good drama with some action thrown in
Oct 28 2021,positive,this version is much less of a campy horror show than the 1984 film especially the floating baron harkonnen who was absolutely grotesque in david lynchs version
Oct 28 2021,positive,a great film even though its clearly a setup movie for more of herberts dune series it looks like a villeneuve movie and thats a good thing id see it again in imax if possible
Oct 28 2021,positive,incredible and so well done cant wait for part 2
Oct 28 2021,positive,so much better than first dune very faithful to book with a few minor changes well done and graphicsspecial effects were superb
Oct 28 2021,negative,ill preface this with the fact i havent read the book so im not sure how true to the original material this movie is ill also say i absolutely love scifi and went into this wanting to love it  the first movie i almost walked out of most of the movie was slow motion dreams of zendaya which kept popping up at really annoying times one or two time yeah sure it shows hes having visions of his future but every 10 minutes it happened again adding nothing new to the plot or taking the story anywhere   none of the scifi elements even slightly make sense useless shields that seem to have just been there to make it very obvious that someone took a killing blow ship designs that made no sense if the laws of physics are to be trusted if any movie  show deviates from this a throw away line stating this is all thats needed this had no such line doctors that at no explanation can see whats wrong with you from just touching you a character being healed in what we can only assume to be a pit of oil with no explanation on how that worked characters speaking in alien languages but getting responded to in english stick to a language and add subtitles mixing between the two would never happen  now onto the general bits of plot that made no sense    there was no overview or summary of the houses and the political situation you eventually grasp a small portion of this as the moview plot progresses but to add more impact an overview at the start of the movie would have added so so much    an invading force blowing up the entire city that they planned to live in the blowing up served no purpose as they had already won    a needless sacrifice of a big name actor just to satisfy a vision when he couldve just not done that and all the characters wouldve still survived i assume this was done to evoke emotion but the relationship between the characters wasnt built up to that level it felt like big name actors were cast in these parts to add that emotion rather than building up the characters themselves   there was no lore building of any kind and you were left to just make assumptions which is fine but not when it leaves you with 100 questions of why on earth would they do that such as the secret cult of women playing both sides to what end how does any of this benefit them they can control people at will it seems too why are they not using this left right and center to rule themselves    maybe it just wasnt for me i can think of 100 more issues but i want to only tread lightly on spoilers such a disapointing movie
Oct 28 2021,positive,i loved the books  i even loved the awful earlier version of the movie i wasnt great but it had sting in it so theres that  this is a big story and demands that the audience keeps up  this version is beautiful and vast i cant wait for the next installment
Oct 28 2021,positive,i wish they would have evened out the sound  the actors were speaking so low that i had to turn my volume all the way to 100 but still couldnt hear a lot of what they were saying but when there were explosions music fight scenes etc it was so loud i had to turn down the volume to 25  luckily i read the book albeit a long time ago otherwise i wouldnt have known what was going on  because i read the book i could piece it all together  that being said fantastic casting and the actors were amazing
Oct 28 2021,positive,amazing rendition of an amazing universe hope to see many more adaptations done by denis truly a great artist
Oct 28 2021,positive,epic awesome movie imax is gorgeous and sound was visceral seats were incredibly uncomfortable
Oct 28 2021,positive,i dont really know where to start here as its hard to say what i didnt like about the film     the aesthetics were on point and everything looks amazing and surprisingly authentic for a desert planet set in thousands of years in the future     the soundtrack is beautiful and adds to the chaos of the film     i just didnt care for it lots ofnear death moments and thats it really shame as i really wanted to live this film
Oct 28 2021,positive,well shot well written well acted movie on the edge of my seat the whole time need part 2 now
Oct 28 2021,positive,denis villeneuve once again demonstrates his mastery of combining visuals to create incredible worlds its a mustsee movie at the cinema we all knew the complexity of adapting the book  it seems to me that some characters were not well developed
Oct 28 2021,neutral,too much confusion in the plot and names of tribes and people in the end it was just a setup for a sequel  no ending to the conflict
Oct 28 2021,positive,i really wanted to like dune 2021 the cinematography was good lighting was sufficiently dark and moody while timothee chalamet and rebecca ferguson were strong and stellan skarsgard was a decent bloated mobboss style villian  i just cant take jason momoa seriously and josh brolin is simply in too many movies oscar isaac while good in ex machina reminds me of a sitcom actor miscast like paul riser in aliens they should have shaved his head or done something with his 2015ish hairdo  most of the cast in fact looked like they had typical modern hairdos  i hate that this is supposed to be really far into the future do something crazy guys meanwhile  the film had typical plot idiocies the chance meeting of javier bardem the tribal leader when lost in the desert 2 flying dragonfly craft relying on flapping wings for lift while wildly more advanced technology hover ships exist was just dumb overall the film felt like any typical battle movie with all the cliches  its disappointing as the enigma of dune seemingly has so much more to offer
Oct 28 2021,positive,great movie every shot is amazing the music and story are amazing
Oct 28 2021,negative,this movie was miserable it dragged on and on and on with the same run for your life scenes over and over again after watching this for 25 painful hours i am still unclear about the full plot everything in this movie could have been accomplished in 90 minutes with more detail to give the viewer an exponentially better experience i am truly baffled at the number of people who enjoyed this movie and think that they are just massive movie buffs that love a more artsy intricate movie they dance around the plot leaving the viewer to fill in the gaps as the movie drags on this left me completely uninterested after the first 30 minutes there is no hook you are just in this constant state of confusion and bore overall if you are a normal movie watcher like me with an untrained eye you will likely be massively disappointed by this movie you could not pay me to sit through it again
Oct 28 2021,positive,from the cinematography to the coloring to the storyline to the likeness to the book too the characters to soundtrack this movie is astonishing
Oct 28 2021,positive,visually impressive but missing the most intriguing parts of the book
Oct 28 2021,positive,dune is a bit dense but at its core is a heroes journey and a chosen one plot  what makes dune stand out are the unique settings creatures and scifi concepts  the movie is beautiful to look at  the sound effects will shake your movie seat      on the negatives a lot of whispering and dialogue that is hard to hear  the film has a few too many dream sequences that dont always feel like they are driving the narrative forward  on top of that a few shots are just unintentionally funny  if you can watch stella skarsgard floating and not laugh youre a better person than me    still my friends and i liked it  hate that the movie just stops mid way through the story but looking forward to seeing the next one
Oct 28 2021,positive,i really like it it is slowly developing the main character in the movie well thought out for part two i guess i only half of ticket so far lol
Oct 28 2021,positive,loved it loved the detail music and emotional depth loved the intense focus
Oct 28 2021,positive,loved this movie better than the 1984 version
Oct 28 2021,positive,only covers half the story from the original suspect there will be a part 2
Oct 28 2021,positive,it was a good movie in terms of plot special effects etc but the soundtrack is horrible not only it sounds super creepy but so ridiculously loud and then when they speak you can barely understand them shouldnt there be a balance in sound
Oct 28 2021,positive,the sound editing was so terrible that it made the whole movie nearly unwatchable the god awful music and the sound effects were way louder than the dialogue making this entire thing very frustrating to endure
Oct 28 2021,negative,dont bother with dune on the big screen stream it if you must the actors are miscast particularly chalumet and the performances are wooden it seems as though the director just took their first take and said ok we got it it is excruciatingly slow and uninteresting visually fans of the book as i am will feel betrayed as i do by how the story and characters are disserved fans of film like me will be offended as i was at the violations of the basics of filmmaking the ornithopters are cool i guess
Oct 28 2021,positive,deserves the hype well done cant wait for the next
Oct 28 2021,positive,epic amazing awesome  the best movie of 2021
Oct 28 2021,positive,much better than 1984 version and amazing special effects
Oct 28 2021,positive,as a kid i loved the original 1984 dune even though it was way before my time  i also enjoyed the syfy made for tv version but this reboot was not only aesthetic pleasing it gave respect to the old and brought with it a new form of storytelling it stood as much as possible true to frank herbert book i hope this continues overall phenomenal awesome
Oct 28 2021,positive,nobody said the spice must flow  not even like once  bummer
Oct 28 2021,negative,dont waste your money
Oct 28 2021,positive,outstanding much better than the original dune misses some things from the novel but what movie doesnt 
Oct 28 2021,positive,a great tale that is mix of the scifi genre and lawrence of arabia
Oct 28 2021,positive,great story great acting
Oct 28 2021,positive,great i you have read the books you will love it cant wait for the part two 
Oct 28 2021,positive,visually beautiful with great music liked the different languages spoken on different planets some of the characters were different than expected
Oct 28 2021,positive,the movie was well done but not in a steak kind of way it was a great movie to watch the score from the legend hans made some scenes pop out at you i will say i was not a fan of all the whispering the movie has a james bond meets stars wars vibe to it especially with how quiet it is during the dialogue im super excited to see part 2
Oct 28 2021,positive,straight up one of the best movies ive ever seen an absolute masterpiece anyone who says different is wrong seriously go see this movie
Oct 28 2021,positive,i havent seen the original and i havent read the book i went into this completely blind and it was okay it was really slow and was trying to explain alot this is a film youd have to either know the lore or see multiple times to enjoy in my opinion has good acting special effects and an intriguing story it just takes time ill probably come back and edit this review when i watch it again but for now i thought it was alright for part 1
Oct 28 2021,positive,followed the book well also great casting choices bravo
Oct 28 2021,negative,very underwhelming compared to the multiple  trailers zendayas character is hardly even in it and the trailer definitely made it seem like she would be a main focus it was quite confusing at the beginning and started making sense as it continued but by then i was losing interest everything had to have some sort of fight scene followed behind it which was total overkill this movie was just a big lead up for a second one which i wont be seeing the visual effects costumes actors  their performances and music score were amazing but not enough to make up for all the rest that the film lacked
Oct 28 2021,negative,fantastic cinematography but confusing plot
Oct 28 2021,positive,this movie was so good that it got me to start reading the books every scene has something interesting going on and the dune universe is full of lore and details to explore fantastic film by the great denis villeneuve cinematography and music score are top notch
Oct 28 2021,positive,loved it love the original and deep storysetting from the novel adaptation   enjoyed the wonderful visuals immersive sound effects and decent combats great movie experience
Oct 28 2021,positive,i loved it i wish more happened but i guess thats what the next one is for a
Oct 28 2021,positive,is better than anything else hollywood has made over the last decade
Oct 28 2021,positive,it was a little confusing at the beginning but then it got interestingyes is a go
Oct 28 2021,positive,slow paced but not boring in the 25 hours i didnt look at my watch  good character development good cinematography
Oct 28 2021,negative,not even worth the two plus hours the fact there was no resolution or proper ending made it that much more worse
Oct 28 2021,positive,the movie is visually gorgeous and the story line is good though predictable  the only bad thing was the sound engineering the characters are talking in a conversational tone while the dramatic music is blaring over it several times i couldnt understand a thing they were saying
Oct 28 2021,positive,epic stuff stunning visuals and solid performances help this long film rattle by good to see hollywood can still make a solid movie if they put their minds to it looking forward to part 2
Oct 28 2021,positive,loved it but they left some key things out hoping they will pull it all together in the sequel
Oct 28 2021,positive,true to the book without cutting out important information which was amazing  great sound track  i wasnt aware that it was to be a multipart story so i was a bit surprised when it ended even after 135 minutes  cant wait for part two
Oct 28 2021,positive,very much follows the book  wonderful cinematography  looking forward the second half of dune and then the rest of the collected works
Oct 28 2021,positive,i dont think it is possible to get closer to the world that frank herbert created  in a movie than this version  the cinematography creates a lush visual reality of dune the storyline stays very close to the book the characters are very true to the original book and the music is fabulous  one specific element i very much enjoyed was that the special relationship between paul and duncan idaho which i actually never really understood from the books is made very real  on the other hand if i have one critique it is that lady jessica a strong bene gesserit is made to seem both emotional and weak which even at the most difficult moments in the book she never is  but that is a minor critique compared to the overall strengths of the movie
Oct 28 2021,positive,i really enjoyed this movie  the characters are nicely developed and the story while a little show paced in places is immersive  which is exactly what you want when entering a fantasy world  very nicely done
Oct 28 2021,positive,wow that was really good 
Oct 28 2021,positive,cant think of anything they could have done better  marvelous
Oct 28 2021,positive,great 1st part lead actor tc is fantastic and will get a lot of work after this and director villanueva really knows how to tell a story without losing the audience there is some strange dialogue however he makes it very easy to understand strongly recommended to scifiapocalypticstar wars fans
Oct 28 2021,positive,one of the weirdest movies ive seen good action and great cast but the white savior theme is played out 
Oct 28 2021,positive,watched on imax as it should be
Oct 28 2021,positive,perfectly caught the mood pacing characterizations and visuals of the book
Oct 28 2021,positive,one of the best movies ive seen in years a must see in imax
Oct 28 2021,negative,it obviously has topnotch production values and talent and its beautiful to watch if you can stay awake surprisingly the 2 hours and 35 minutes in this version covers less than half of the story we saw in david lynchs 1984 dune which clocked in at 2 hours 17 minutes here very little story is stretched thinly across so much time that it seems nothing substantial happens at all and when it ends theres no ending no resolution an abrupt stop with an assumption that well all show up for part ii and yet i cant say there was even a cliffhanger to suggest a part ii lynchs dune was wacky and messy and far from perfect but it was also more fun and had a great story arc with an ending and at nearly 20 minutes shorter than this halfversion the craft is here but the storytelling is disappointing it seems the film was developed by accountants and a committee that wanted maximum hours of content to fillout a release schedule not much artistic vision came through like a lot films though maybe ill see it differently several years down the road
Oct 28 2021,positive,frank herberts dune and to some extent the subsequent collection is one of if not the grandstanding pillar of twentiethcentury literature lauded by all and deemed unadaptable to film by many herberts insanely dense worldbuilding and spiraling cosmos of themes is a beast like no other bringing dune to the realm of film takes a small miracle every time as several not entirely unsuccessful attempts have previously shown but if there was one man up to serve the definitive job in 2021 it would be the modern master denis villeneuve and yes    in the year 10191 the consciousnessexpanding hallucinogenic spice melange has allowed humanity to populate the stars under a winding game of intergalactic political chess duke leto i oscar isaac of house atreides is granted dominion of the spices singular source the desert planet arrakis by the padishah emperor shaddam iv removing the tyrannical baron of house harkonnen stellan skarsgård from his prior fiefdom as leto his son paul timothée chalamet and lady jessica rebecca ferguson begin to lay roots with arrakis oppressed native people the fremen in hopes of forming an alliance the course of history is forever shaken when hostile forces converge against the atreides in a noholds barred vie for control of the planet and its precious resource    i could watch villeneuves dune forever words are but wisps in describing the majesty the director breathes into herberts world an observant vision rooted in his earliest documentarian origins that allows the films titanic scale to unfold as if by natural way the magnitude is immeasurable the scope no less than astronomical and villeneuve allows the rising stakes to speak for themselves through the sightly grandeur of greig frasers incredible cinematography and visual poetry meanwhile in a repeat of his and benjamin wallfischs triumphant collaboration with villeneuve on blade runner 2049 hans zimmers rousing score has forever secured itself a place rattling through my bones its grand multicultural influences informing the evolved yet ancient landscapes and production designs of the year 10191 wow    dune is as epic as it is elegant and as a primarily experiential piece has notably streamlined the clusters of thematic fibers herberts novel made its name on there are still overtones of political machination transcendent humanism and messianic deconstruction but the textures have been sanded down significantly manifesting more by inference than the challenging expounded philosophical provocations circulating through the source material as the stark foil to the airy extensively monologuedriven mysticism of david lynchs unjustly maligned 1984 adaptation the films sensory richness does come with a notable cost to its simplified screenplay as villeneuve jon spaihts and eric roth create no room to delve into characters heads presenting herberts world as it is rather than what its about    the lady jessica misses out on some critical characterization as a result fulfilling the role of pauls mom and little more despite fergusons capable performance conversely skarsgårds baron loses his overdone villainy and is polished into a figure of pure menace more appropriate to the story being told most other aspects remain intact and familiar in a perfectly cast troupe of actors and while overall a somewhat diminished experience missing the lifeblood of the novel any and every complaint also comes with the caveat that the films bigger ideas could very well alight in part 2 but as it stands now in 2021 villeneuve is so cohesive and confident in his vision that his first trip to dune proudly lives on as its own thing
Oct 28 2021,positive,it was very well casted    everyone did a phenomenal job  story telling was done a nice pace as well  visuals were great
Oct 28 2021,positive,amazing acting musical score and cinematography a must see in the theater
Oct 28 2021,positive,decent movie but really just a leadup to the next ones
Oct 28 2021,positive,this is an incredible adaptation of dune  and now i need to give the obligatory mention that ive read the book so the major issues i have with the film are nitpicky issues to casual users  however i do think they are important issuesand ones that in a movie with the scope of dune should really be included  in addition there are things that could have been dialed back as well      the good  the movie is gorgeous intelligently written and for the most part well acted  all the major bullet points it needed to hit from the book it hit  its also the perfect movie to go back to the theatre for and i hope it is successful enough to greenlight some of the other books in the dune series      the bad  every time paul chalomet is on screen he has to either have a vision or have a fremen character mention something about prophecy to him  they beat him over the head with it so much that were only halfway through the story and the main character already believes hes the one theyre all prophesizing about  same thing with his relationship with chani  she shows up in his visions so many times that of course theyre going to get together  meanwhile there is very little mention how valuable water is this willshould be very important in the next film on arrakis very little of uwes backstory that is revealedhowever this isnt as egregious since there is also no mention of his imperial conditioning ie why he has a diamond on his forehead and they gleaned over shadat mapes when shes actually really important      the ugly  jason momoa is terrible  not quite russellcrowelesmiserables terrible but hes bad  the role of duncan needs more than jason playing himself as he did in aquaman or just painted up eye candy that just has to look pissed off all the time as he was with khal drogo      in summary while this version of dune isnt perfect by any means its likely going to be the best adaptation out there for quite a while and is easily better than the 1984 version as well as the syfy series
Oct 28 2021,positive,great movie cant wait for part 2
Oct 28 2021,positive,dune is an epic film cant wait for part 2
Oct 28 2021,positive,alot going on very symbolic music was impeccable acting was pretty good jason momoa was og and overall great movie
Oct 28 2021,positive,it was good but a bit too long
Oct 28 2021,positive,the updated version was super well done cant wait until the sequelnext chapters from the book series are made
Oct 28 2021,positive,beautiful movie definitely only act 1 this will be more realistic for the counterattack though
Oct 28 2021,positive,i liked the movie and was loving the architecture  cant wait to see dune part 2
Oct 28 2021,positive,pure scifi drama  no comic relief  very refreshing from the popmusictype movies that have been going on for years now  visually perfect  see it in the dolby or imaxthe sound is incredible in this movie
Oct 27 2021,positive,my wife and i read the book in preparation for the film and we were both very impressed with how they adapted the story for the screen we didnt feel like any of the changes or exclusions had a massive effect on the overall impact or plot   my favorite thing about this movie is the sound design the score was always spoton it really solidified the atmosphere and made you feel what was happening in a deeper way also the cinematography was breathtaking the colors were toptier   also also i was giddy seeing an ornithopter for the first time   it is absolutely essential that you see this movie in theaters
Oct 27 2021,positive,great adaptation of the book  took some understandable liberties but it was great great casting great cgi  as a dune fan this was a gem
Oct 27 2021,positive,such an amazing film that respects herberts original work and puts such emphasis on the atmosphere and world building
Oct 27 2021,positive,superb on3 if the best films ive seen for a very long time i loved the music the acting the story the special effects cant fault this film to be honest i was hooked from start to finish and really wasnt expecting it to be as good going by the trailer     i cant wait for the next one
Oct 27 2021,positive,i saw this movie in a rpx theater  in a lot of the scenes the music was so loud you couldnt hear the dialogue otherwise a good movie
Oct 27 2021,negative,there wasnt much character development  i wasnt impressed with the dialogue either  the second half of the movie was slow  it had a few good action scenes but thats about it
Oct 27 2021,positive,wow its rare to have a movie that makes you leave the theater not wanting to speak not from sadness or happiness though from the awe of it all what a film
Oct 27 2021,positive,acting was excellent the director filmed more true to the book by frank herbert cinematically beautiful
Oct 27 2021,positive,thought it was fun i liked the beat
Oct 27 2021,positive,amazing movie and one of the best ive seen in many years the visuals storyline and costumes are so cool cant wait for part 2 
Oct 27 2021,negative,an absolute piece of polished dog sht
Oct 27 2021,positive,i never write review for movies but i was moved by this film  everything hit for me about this movie  the large epic scale and atmosphere created by denis is beautiful and awe inspiring tuned to an amazing score by hans zimmer when seen on imax created truly a special special cinematic experience  i implore anyone reading this to go see it in the largest format you can  even if you dont like the move the audio and visual treat alone is one we do not get often  i cant wait for part 2 3 4 5  this is the next star wars game of thrones matrix lord of the rings etc
Oct 27 2021,positive,perfection the lord of the rings of science fiction gets an amazing adaptation
Oct 27 2021,positive,among my top 5 best scifi movies
Oct 27 2021,positive,the movie was very interesting and different
Oct 27 2021,neutral,so many worthless scenes nothing in the movie deserved that epic film score the lewd was a poor mans hayden such a letdown i loved blade runner this is not it 
Oct 27 2021,positive,very well made dialog was straight from the book a couple of scene changes from the book but nothing lost in translation looking forward to a repeat viewing and the remainder of book one
Oct 27 2021,positive,saw it friday opening night with the wife and kids 19 16  13 and we all loved it my 16yo and i saw it again tuesday night just for kicks the movie does by even faster and we enjoyed it even more
Oct 27 2021,positive,absolutely stunned and completely satisfied with this first part of the story im an admirer of villeneuves work and read the book in anticipation of the film im super on board with the way this story is told and captured and found so many scenes truly riveting in away i dont remember feeling in a theater in a long time its a long movie for sure but not exactly what i would describe as slow
Oct 27 2021,positive,great plot build up world building character building and battle scenes the movie did both the audience and the book readers justice with how well it tells frank herberts story 
Oct 27 2021,positive,an artistic masterpiece denis villeneuve is batting a thousand in my book one of very best directors in hollywood today
Oct 27 2021,positive,fantastic movie  helps to have read the moviebut every viewer will be entranced by the sheer magnitude of the universe and depth of story  the pinnacle of scifi literature has been masterfully adapted for the big screen  only why did they make dr kynes a woman  unnecessary
Oct 27 2021,positive,dune is a cinematic masterpiece i was fully immersed ive seen it twice now and i can say the spice is life
Oct 27 2021,positive,the movie was great loved the music great actors
Oct 27 2021,positive,easily one of the most epic movies i have ever experienced in the theatre i couldnt stop smiling all the way through i was almost overwhelmed with how good it was the screenplay was of course fantastic the scope and ambition of the environments was impressive the performances were amazing the characters were awesome and badss the score was powerful and enthralling and the visuals were a sight to behold i loved how realistic of a scifi movie this was and all of the concepts were very interesting its also a scifi movie with no actual alien races which i found captivating i would 100 recommend this movie to anyone who loves game of thrones star wars and even lord of the rings dune has been influential for the first two so i can see those fans finding lots of things to love here i would even recommend this to general audiences just because of how impressive and ambitious the movie is this is a movie that needs to be supported as it is a not just a fastpaced action blockbuster it has those elements but it also has higher intellectual concepts which is what they call a thinking mans scifi i appreciated that the movie was faithful to its source material but also was easier to digest for newcomers to the series this movie reminds me of why i love films and what keeps me passionate about films you gotta see it to believe it
Oct 27 2021,positive,i watched it on hbo max first and the theater second watch it in the theater its worth the money its a goodsimple story and exceptional film production design sound cinematographyetc
Oct 27 2021,positive,this movie is ridiculously good i cant wait for dune part 2 go see it in theaters
Oct 27 2021,positive,the production is incredible and the performances are good but the long duration of the dune is not justiffied having some slowplot moments that make you wonder when will this end
Oct 27 2021,positive,never read the books had no expectations going into this movie but wow this is such an epic story i cant wait for the sequels 
Oct 27 2021,positive,the movies use of sounds and effects created incredible science fiction scenes that made you feel so engrossed in the environment hans zimmer absolutely nailed it which an incredibly interesting story that had me hooked  needing more 1010 will now reach out and read the books
Oct 27 2021,positive,honestly a really good movie i loved it 
Oct 27 2021,positive,magnificent    faithful to the compelling story told in the scifi classic of the same name yet with fresh interpretation that should provide pleasant surprises to the most loyal of frank herberts readers    for those who are new to the story the movie is a visual treat  i cant wait to see it again preferably in an imax theater
Oct 27 2021,negative,makes no sense too long dont care about the characters
Oct 27 2021,positive,wow what an atmosphere and nice sound even if the movie runs a 25h there is no boring second  masterpiece
Oct 27 2021,positive,omg its the best movie ive seen in a loooong while absolutely recommend imax or no imax just see it
Oct 27 2021,positive,absolutely a masterpiece i love the dune book series and saw all the other versions this by far is the best depiction and easy to understand even for the novice  cinnemaphotogrphy and art direction are jawdroppingly gorgeous slow burner but its needed cant wait for part 2 love love love
Oct 27 2021,positive,dreams are messages from the deep villeneuves interpretation of herberts classic scifi novel is bold in how it does not try to appeal to mass audience and instead focuses on preserving its source material in spirit if not always in its literal shape there is much attention to the visuals here more so even that the plot but it all makes sense once you understand that it is trough the sheer scope of nigh incomprehensibly large spaceships and buildings that villeneuve is trying to convey the magnitude and solemnity of herberts creation this movie is an amazing experience to watch it really transports the viewer into the far future of cosmic feudal grand houses ruthless empire like the ancient ones used to be and nearly magical creatures religions and philosophies when you watch dune you are on dune or at least you can feel the gravitas on being there in that kind of universe that being said there is still a long long way to go for this franchise and i really do hope it will become a franchise at least at to the point of the adaptation of chapterhouse dune hopefully beyond so minus points for the very fact that we dont have part ii right now and for making us so so unsure if there even will be a part ii but those go to the hollywood executives and as for now villeneuve can do no wrong in the world of cinema
Oct 27 2021,positive,spectacular well worth the trip to the cinema cant wait for part 2
Oct 27 2021,positive,amazing adaptation of the book they had to cut some elements but i really apreciate the attention to detail and the pace of the film superb visuals and sound
Oct 27 2021,positive,amazing movie basically a 2 hour trailer that will set up the rest of the series but was still a great watch
Oct 27 2021,positive,it was a great movie 2 and a half hours honestly felt short i could have been there for 5 without ever checking my watch or anything just a stunning movie which was way better than my expectations
Oct 27 2021,positive,one of the most beautiful movies ever
Oct 27 2021,positive,the movie gave depth to the main characters and faithfully displayed them however with the unavoidable gender swap and racial variety under the fremen it didnt escape the hollywood touchup  the story builds slowly but kept my interest throughout with eye candy not just stunning landscapes of arakis but also of caladan and giedi prime were also treated with new interpretations of the ornithopters and ships used by the space guild  although this is the first part of the story it ends with an emotional closure well worth waiting for although many storylines whet the appetite for the upcoming second part
Oct 27 2021,positive,superb visuals and pacing and chalumet is wonderful as he always seems to be  but thats not to say the rest of the cast isnt great too i am interested to see how lesser roles in this first part expand it latte parts villeneuve has hit another home run
Oct 27 2021,neutral,saw it in 3d which was actually very poorly done and the dialogue was so low in the mix we would have liked subtitles all the way through
Oct 27 2021,positive,good depiction of the story nice acting hope they continue to the next one
Oct 27 2021,positive,cant wait for the sequel
Oct 27 2021,negative,having read the original series im a frank herbert fan and watched the 1984 movie i was really looking forward to the latest movie   in short  it was an expensive flop special effects were great actors and their actual acting were great   but the movie itself was 2 hours of boredom with about 5 minutes of actually interesting film i honestly think i would have been more entertained watching grass grow in winter it was that boring it triedand failed
Oct 27 2021,negative,this movie should be offered on cable tvnot at the movie theaters
Oct 27 2021,negative,ask yourself if rebecca ferguson wasnt playing the beautiful woman in distress role with her onscreen son playing the anakin skywalker role would this movie be half as compelling the cast and visuals are amazing though a bit too dark and a bit too droning the scifi is a bit too removed from reality while much of the story attempts to be at least militaristically groundedthats a hard balance and i dont believe they get it quite right i was interested but not more and far too often looking forward to the ending
Oct 27 2021,positive,the movie is so long but you dont even notice the time passing cause it manages to get your atention for the hole time  i saw it twice and both times i left the theater with that amazing feeling you get after watching a good movie its so satisfying honesthy i cant wait for part 2 the photography is amazing and  villeneuve really knew what he was doing with this amazing adaptation from the book something hard to be done in such a good way  recommend the movie even if youre not big into scifi cause i am not and i loved it so much everyone should see it in the big screen its a unique experience
Oct 27 2021,positive,impressive film epic and without equal it was time for this quality of cinema to return again
Oct 27 2021,positive,i already know the story i read the books and i saw the first movie a long time ago i like it so far and i cant wait for part 2
Oct 27 2021,negative,if youre only willing to go to see one movie in theaters per year or even five years then make sure its dune this movie was capturing and awe inspiring from the first minute until the very last shot the beautiful visuals were absolutely breathtaking but the acting writing and cinematography allow it to be so much more than just a pretty picture dont take my word for it do yourself a favor and go see dune while its still in theaters i guarantee you wont regret it
Oct 27 2021,positive,absolutely loved this movie visually stunning very faithful to the source material i hate that we have to wait 2 years for the sequel
Oct 27 2021,positive,great casting adherence to book great sets and pacing beautiful
Oct 27 2021,positive,terrific incredibly detailed  spectacular special effects outstanding costuming  makeup  action packed and even though ive read  seen all things dune quite suspenseful
Oct 27 2021,negative,the movie was the first dune that i thought fitted my minds view of the story from reading the books but it did not end they are saying that the second part is coming however they have not even planed the second part     they didnt shoot anything of the second part they do not have the money or any concrete plans to finish the story    this even though it started out a winner and could have become the perfect dune because they cannot ever finish the thread of the film that they started this version turns out to be the very worst version of dune ever filmed it is a complete waste of time     there is only one aspect of this film that should be studied in film school how to completely screw the pooch with unfinished possibilities
Oct 27 2021,positive,excellent scenery and acting great story with computer generation sequel is coming sometime the sand dust would cover the scene to much making it hard to follow what was actually happening
Oct 27 2021,positive,wow just wow     i sat watching mesmerised for two and a half hours and at the end i was left feeling no please you cant just stop here     a truely magnificent spectacle    i just hope he has a chance more material 
Oct 27 2021,positive,great movie the beginning of an incredible series everything star wars shouldve been no weird looking characters with fake jamaican accents or hairy gargling mongoloids nor people talking to robots
Oct 27 2021,positive,so glad i saw this in the movie theater stunning
Oct 27 2021,positive,amazing visuals compelling story best sci fi ive seen in a long time
Oct 27 2021,positive,amazing visuals in imax
Oct 27 2021,positive,dialogue i felt was bland acting was decent from the leads some concepts were intriguing but i felt the film relied on its special effects too heavily to keep the audience engaged i felt lost having known nothing about dune beforehand and despite the film being nearly three hours long it some how felt rushed still the film passes time and but was mid
Oct 27 2021,positive,it was a well filmed picture  with a lot of action
Oct 27 2021,positive,it was ok but not amazing
Oct 27 2021,neutral,visually cool other than that it was mid
Oct 27 2021,positive,it was a must see people fighting in the future without any meetings or statergy just come as they go so to speak even on sand i loved the selection of character and the music it was well thought out and planned i can diffinately see a sequal to this one special  effects were great
Oct 27 2021,negative,oy how i wanted to love this movie the actors are great the costumes are great the special effects are great but by the end of the whole ordeal i just didnt care about anyone or anything that was happening on the screen too many extended scenes of destruction that didnt forward the plot too many visions trying to show how the spice was affecting paul so many characters that were just there with no explanation poor thufir hawat  lots of screen time but not a single explanation of what a mentat is or why hes important maybe part 2 will be more engaging but by the end of this two and a half hours my son and i were both ready for it to end
Oct 27 2021,positive,full of action and nods to the original i was concerned about them trying to cram too much into the film but with the opening stating dune part 1 that cleared that up  the performances of duncan idaho and gurney mallak were well done and the reason for the treachery is not well shown  i liked it and look forward to more in dune part 2
Oct 27 2021,negative,good enough to intrigue you so will definitely watch the next one but not very good that will watch this one again and again
Oct 27 2021,neutral,the original dune was awful this one had much better special effects however was difficult to follow you really dont need a difficult complex plot for a good scifi movie the best ones have simple plots and are easy to follow
Oct 27 2021,positive,im a big fan of the books and really loved how faithful this film was to the original vision  the film does a great job of world building to people who have not read the books  the time flew by because its pacing was good for me
Oct 27 2021,positive,i honestly enjoyed every moment of it i dont usually want to watch movies for the second time but i already want to watch dune again absolutely loved it cant wait for part two 1010
Oct 27 2021,positive,i havent read any of the dune novels but this film was amazing dune is grandiose in scale and i believe perfectly puts the viewer into the world of dune the biggest takeaway for me was hans zimmers score his score fit the film perfectly and really set the stage for this amazing film
Oct 27 2021,positive,i loved it great special effects the only thing i didnt like is there are two parts wanted to see the whole story in one movie
Oct 27 2021,positive,if you like adventure this is the flick excellent movie maybe my favorite for the year
Oct 27 2021,negative,with two movies i had hoped to get a story more true to and more from the book  instead in the first half we have been presented with a visual candy with a hollowed story concentrating on two characters minimizing most others and deleting some out  in the book pauls character begins his journey as an adult physically but still mentally thinking more as an adolescent and then forced into his prophecy and become the mesiah  in later books a path he shirks to his son  but in the movie we see him act as a little petulant boy  where is the development of raban and the baron so you understand their motives  where is the emperor irulan or feyd  dont know  neither do i and it will be hard to insert them in the next movie and make them seem meaningful  dr yueh who betrayed and brought house atreides down  why well that is pretty much glossed over  no how his imperial conditioning was broken  why his imperial conditioning should be trusted  nope all that is gone  we have big name actors play roles that they dont really fill but change the role to represent them and show off their heroics  i understand that you can never duplicate the book but man was this disappointing  i am sure people who have not read the book will fall in love and the wonderful eye candy presented  i just cant get over how hollow the film seems a mere shadow of this wonderful piece of science fiction  at least the suspense of getting to see this latest creation is over and we dont have to wonder when the second film will come  watch the sci fi mini series for a much better story and tale  better yet read the book  this movie fell flat on its expensive behind
Oct 27 2021,positive,dune 2021 i didnt read the book movie does a good job of worldbuilding and mythmaking beautiful look i was surprised by how much star wars borrowed from dune young men of destiny tatooinearrakis forcevoice jedibene gesserit was star wars the dune for kids b
Oct 27 2021,positive,where do i begin visually stunning with a thundering score to match highly nuanced performances from leads chalamet and ferguson deft directorial work on difficult source material it is the dune movie that any fan of herberts classic will adore
Oct 27 2021,positive,with this film denis villeneuve has achieved what has been impossible until now  create a brilliant film based on f herberts seminal novel dune  epic in scope the success of the film is in the brilliant performances by the sublime cast  the only question remaining is whether the producers will attempt to create an ongoing franchise there were six books written in the original series or will they merely complete the dune novels story arc  thank you to everyone involved in the making of this film
Oct 27 2021,positive,loved it everything i could have hoped for
Oct 27 2021,positive,they dont know how to pronounce harkonnen
Oct 27 2021,positive,visually it very good  acting wasnt great  a lot of lines were mumbled when they were wearing their masks  storyline was predictable and sometimes didnt even make sense
Oct 27 2021,positive,mindblowing best possible adaptation of the book
Oct 27 2021,positive,such a beautiful film
Oct 27 2021,negative,extremely boring dont waste your time
Oct 27 2021,positive,comedy seemed out of place
Oct 27 2021,positive,overall very good moviethought the musicsounds got a bit extreme
Oct 27 2021,positive,beautifully filmed movie with great special effects and good action definitely looking forward to confirmed sequel never realized such parallel to star wars 
Oct 27 2021,positive,the soundtrack and visuals are incredible never before have i felt the scale and weight of starcraft like i did watching this film the acting was decent but i imagine it being harder to follow in some places for those that didnt read the book however the focus on less work building more immersion worked and pulls you along without you feeling like you need to understand the details i very much hope there is a part 2
Oct 27 2021,positive,good movie  followed the book
Oct 27 2021,negative,imagine 3 hours of waiting for something to happen
Oct 27 2021,positive,as a scifi fan and star wars fan id heard of dune many times  it wasnt until i saw the trailer for this adaptation that i wanted to delve into its universe  i chose to read the first novel in the month leading up to the movies release  i watched it first at home and then in theaters in imax like id always planned  i really enjoyed this movie  knowing about the characters beforehand and then seeing them portrayed on screen was a delight  every little moment had me gasping because i knew what it meant and what was coming next  the visual effects are well done the cinematography is beautiful and the actorsactresses really inhabit their characters
Oct 27 2021,positive,dune is a visual masterpiece every scene looks like it could be a beautiful painting that could be hung on the wall the music and the sound production is astronomical the story is laid out to near perfection given the dense source material the acting is top notch however i couldnt help but find myself emotionally detached from the characters even though the movie is absolutely gorgeous to look at its still left me a little empty the story itself and how it pieces is great but its some of the characters that i found a little lacking
Oct 27 2021,positive,just a sensational  depiction of one of the best books of the scifi genre smashing scenes and sound accompaniment best read the book first but a mustsee
Oct 27 2021,positive,while the movie was full of action the original storyline has been sadly altered if there is a sequel i might give a better review there is so much more to the story that could allow for it to become a series which would be better received by the fans of the frank herbert trilogy
Oct 27 2021,positive,beautiful movie to watch great writing acting and story telling i had high expectations going in but was not disappointed best film this year by far the only complaint is that i have to wait for the sequels
Oct 27 2021,positive,unlike original filming of dune it was easier to follow with the story and carried the flavor as it was written in the book
Oct 27 2021,negative,this movie was to busy trying to be epic that it forgot to be good i feel like it didnt do a good enough job explaining the universe from the books the characters are throw away i honestly wanted this to be good and it was a huge let down unfortunately maybe would have done better as a big budget tv show
Oct 27 2021,positive,well this film gets it right the effects are amazing and its story is finally told the right way on film cant wait for part 2
Oct 27 2021,positive,epic masterpiece stunning cinematography
Oct 27 2021,positive,better than expected
Oct 27 2021,positive,it was a great movie and set up for more to come this was part 1 of i dont know how many parts but it was really good it was very interesting and had a lot of different angles where the main character paul had to make decisions and use his skills in different ways overall very good
Oct 27 2021,positive,wow one of best movies ive seen larger than life imaginative gritty scifi universe having read the book helps get the most out of the experience will be seeing this one multiple times in theater
Oct 27 2021,positive,it is a visual delight the story was easy to follow seeing timothys face on the big screen is an extra star enjoyed
Oct 27 2021,positive,i can not think of much that would make this film better its finally dune as it should be
Oct 27 2021,positive,a few of the scenes went on longer than necessary  the ending left me feeling incomplete but i suppose that is to allow for a sequel
Oct 27 2021,positive,had to split the rating read dune many times in my teens and was really excited to see an adaptation that finally seemed worth seeing have not seen previous attempts first movie ive seen in a theater since 2019 traveled past 6 theaters to see it in imax the pro really really good adaptation of a very challenging book visually amazing great characters and if youre a dune fan you should without question go see this and preferably in imax if possible cant wait til late 2023 for dune 2    the con i would have to recommend against this movie if you are not a fan of the book already it would bechallenging to follow the movie and the characters are not as clearly portrayed as they could have been also while the soundtrack was phenomenal there were times particularly near the end when the mix was so heavy that i could not hear the dialogue at all
Oct 27 2021,positive,the movie does a fairly accurate job in following the book excellent choice in actors for the roles as well
Oct 27 2021,positive,amazing movie loved every minute its a slow burn but not in a way that felt slow paced to me cant wait for part 2
Oct 27 2021,positive,i loved the movie both times  looking forward to seeing a directors cut at sometime for even more footage
Oct 27 2021,positive,entertaining from what i remember it is following what was written in the book
Oct 27 2021,negative,most boring movie ever
Oct 27 2021,negative,the movie changed the original story too much and it didnt tell the entire story
Oct 27 2021,positive,great movie and no stop action waiting for year 2023 to see part two
Oct 27 2021,positive,recommend reading the book first cool scifi movie
Oct 27 2021,positive,epic and sprawling in scale but a bit long in the tooth imax is a must 4 stars but be weary of the pacing
Oct 27 2021,positive,everything a scifi movie has to have of course is predictable but still has its moments i cant wait to see the second part
Oct 27 2021,positive,this was the second time i had seen dune and it didnt have the same response as the first time namely because on the second showing i am looking for depth in the adaptation and just not seeing it  regardless this is an exceptional movie and adaptation from frank herberts story  if you focus on character growth its superb
Oct 27 2021,positive,it was am awesome movie but for me it was a slow paced film had fun though
Oct 27 2021,positive,went in with high expectations watched it in gtx was not disappointed cast was perfect action sequences were perfect i might have teared up a time or two when i did not expect to at all timothee was great as always rebecca was phenomenal oscar did a great job and i even liked jason momoa in this one although i have never liked him in another movie 1010
Oct 27 2021,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and cannot wait for the second part  i believe it grabs the most important important aspects of the book i left the theater eager in anticipation of the continuation of the movie in part 2  i hope it is made
Oct 27 2021,positive,great characters development great sound effects great world building and fantastic cgi  cant wait for part 2
Oct 27 2021,positive,fantastic class a scifi film looking forward to part 2
Oct 27 2021,positive,the ending is rather anticlimactic but dune is a visual feast that leaves you excited for another instalment
Oct 27 2021,positive,solid hard sciencefiction  good world building that can be slow at times as we get to know the characters but in no way bogged down by unessential scenes
Oct 27 2021,positive,if you know dune like myself  my father youre almost certainly going to enjoy this film    if you dont know jack about dune like my significant other or my stepmother youre probably gonna enjoy this movie    in short this is sciencefantasy at its finest kind of loud though enough to be a little rough on the ears
Oct 27 2021,positive,reviewers who compare this film unfavourably to lawrence of arabia may simply prefer that story to frank herberts or they are wanting to overburden us with their own authority as critics to suggest villeneuves effort is inferior to leans is churlish silliness
Oct 27 2021,positive,great addaption to the book its 230 hours long and covers half the book    it is a part 1 of 2 so you have to bear that in mind    very slow but tense and wildly beautiful
Oct 27 2021,positive,this is a very good start to a 2 movie series theres a few slow spots but on the whole id see it again its not exactly following the book but few movies based on books do but the changes are reasonably well done some character development needs to happen for those not familiar with the book but that can be done in part two in all its a must see even as long as it is
Oct 27 2021,positive,didnt have to explain every little detail to my girlfriend like i usually do phenomenal
Oct 27 2021,positive,the movie has good action and great characters one criticism is the plot it is far too confusing and complicated you have to spend half the movie trying to figure it out  pretty standard scifi action adventure if you like this i would recommend doctor who and star wars
Oct 27 2021,positive,we were going to a theatre in london and my mum asked what i wanted to watch i picked dune and my mum the whole movie thought she was watching a marvel movie    it does explain why she was on her phone for 5 minutes in the credits then asked is there an end credits scene
Oct 27 2021,positive,stunning visuals amazing sound an engrossing story dune is a film that demands to be seen on the biggest screen possible a movie for both fans of the books as well as those who have never read them
Oct 27 2021,positive,as someone who read dune and the other books in the series as a teen and had heard terrible reviews of the previous movie i was very pleasantly surprised to see that this movie wasnt just another action movie and that not only was it visually stunning but the story adaptation was well executed as well    i have high hopes for the subsequent films
Oct 27 2021,negative,set in afghanistan but with sandworms from return of the jedi 1980s everyone wants to farm the hallucinogenic spice no not opium poppies and evil imperial powers send in stormtroopers but wait a fated boy who doubts himself but has great lineage mums a witch and like harry potter is full of teenage angst but unlike harry he is on for a girl far hotter than ginny weasley full of cgi utterly derivative
Oct 27 2021,positive,denis villenueve the best director of our time
Oct 27 2021,positive,amazing visuals and sounds an appreciated slower pace that allows you to enjoy the world this isnt some dumb superhero film that needs an explosion or a corny joke every thirty seconds this is art
Oct 27 2021,positive,the visuals are good like b i think bladerunner 2049  was better in terms of that and story sounds were b overall its worth a watch on a big screen but honestly not the hype its been worth go on a 7 night the story could have been told alot better and characters developed more its a b 6810
Oct 27 2021,positive,beautifully made along with solid acting and story kept in line with source material some slow spots but only because of character development and its the first part in a series of future sequels
Oct 27 2021,positive,best movie 2021 must see on the biggest screen
Oct 27 2021,positive,best movie of the year and best scifi movie in of the decade
Oct 27 2021,negative,nothing happens in this movie
Oct 27 2021,negative,too loud my seat shook im not saying this to be dramatic but it hurt my ears i would have walked out if the ticket hadnt been a present from a person that was sitting next to me and knows id read the book five times i spent the movie with my fingers in my ears it was a nightmare dune was a miserable experience why why make a movie so loud it causes hearing damage im at an utter loss as to why they did this how could anyone be so stupid i watched the last james bond in imax a week ago and in dune the closing of a door in a library was louder than a gunshot in no time to die i love the book i have no idea if they did a good job adapting it because it was so loud what were they thinking maybe ill love the film when i watch it on hbo
Oct 27 2021,positive,wow what an amazing experience  a very powerful experience  i saw it in the theater on opening weekend and it blew me away  everything really worked well for me  amazing score amazing acting wonderful cinematography just a really well done movie i like a lot of scifi but this really went past a regular scifi movie the story was bigger than that and touched so many different aspects  such a fun experience see it in the theater so worth it
Oct 27 2021,positive,a fantastic film the acting was wonderful giving life to each of the characters and hooking you to their plights quickly visuals were fantastic with attention paid to using simplicity with skill and still developing a rich environment the score was sweeping and set the tone perfectly the story was well told and evenly paced definitely looking forward to the sequel
Oct 27 2021,neutral,well honestly thank you so much for the best looking 2 and a half hours of blue balls
Oct 27 2021,positive,knew very little going into this but its denis villeneuve i didnt need much convincing i feel i enjoyed it more because of how little i knew admittedly it is a little slow and takes its time getting into the action but i think the time we get and the building of anticipation of what might be coming is amazing and when the action hits overall cant wait for the 2nd part     side note was surprised at the amount of blood and brutality but its not over the top
Oct 27 2021,positive,great adaptation of the epic story
Oct 27 2021,positive,amazing visual master piece that did justice to the novel series wish it was longer and had more details from the book but it hit on the highs and the changes to the plot was relevant so no complaints
Oct 27 2021,positive,we are facing a cinematic titan  it tells the story of a novel that was the father of the scifi genre  direction almost perfect only in a couple of points i was a bit hesitant  great special effects and photography  the cast is super spot on  zimmer did one of his best music comparable to pirates of the caribbean and the gladiator i dont give it 5 stars because to say that it can be a masterpiece we have to wait about ten years  i am italian and i have already seen it 3 times at the cinema once in the original language  what can i say go and see it and there is only to applaud in villeneuve
Oct 27 2021,positive,awesome special effects and visuals and music and very cool
Oct 27 2021,positive,very worth it to see it on an imax screen
Oct 27 2021,positive,1010  only issue with it was that its going to be 2 years until part two a lot of dumb fans complaining about it being boring and not understanding this isnt shangchi not here for the powers punches and kicks which dune does also have this is a highconcept scifi movie    star wars lord of the rings dune enough said
Oct 27 2021,positive,without being very familar with the source material and only remembering bits and pieces of the 1984 original adaptation dune part 1 is beautiful easy to digest which doing so seemed to be no small feat and thrilling cannot wait for part 2 so glad its greenlit
Oct 27 2021,positive,fresh new view of an original classic
Oct 27 2021,negative,who ever did the audio f up the music is so loud but the voices are quieter than the crickets not enough action and the plot is paced slower than a race of snails honestly feels like the movie banked on having the stacked casting and then didnt use any of them to their potential zendaya the one in almost all the advertisement is only in it near the end over all was not fun to watch and my family didnt even finish watching it lots of just scene of them just standing there looking at what i assume is a green screen finished the movie not caring at all about what happened to the characters
Oct 27 2021,positive,my husband and i have been looking forward to seeing this for quite some time we were definitely not disappointed really hoping they continues with this 
Oct 27 2021,negative,waste of money   watch this movie if you love being bored and confused the entire time
Oct 27 2021,negative,dune struggled to be understood most of the film with confusing character definitions and slow pacing and unbalanced sound its impressive scale and sweeping whimsical scenes make for beautiful shots but the film lacked any sort of character building introducing new people and dismissing them with little backstory while i do love the actors in this film there was really no portrayal of their capabilities it would have almost been better to use no name actors so that the film would have actually have had to try it felt like episode 1 of a tv series after 25 hours not that much actually happens beyond overtly setting up for a sequel in the end its a disappointing product for something that had the potential to be transcendent
Oct 27 2021,positive,every scene in this movie is beautiful there was not a single moment where i thought the cgi looked bad also the score was phenomenal this also has an allstar cast and they deliver     this is a mustsee for everyone not just fans of the book
Oct 27 2021,positive,great as a part 1 but not as a stand alone
Oct 27 2021,negative,2 and a half hour trailer for part 2  would have been upset if i went to the movies and paid 30
Oct 27 2021,positive,dune arrakis desert planet theres no doubt this movie was made by a true fan and an auteur the use of silence really helps capture the vastness of the world the use of light the alienness of the future humans
Oct 27 2021,positive,visually amazing with a mesmerizing soundtrack excellent interpretation of the book onto screen eagerly anticipating part 2
Oct 27 2021,positive,visually beautiful great actors
Oct 27 2021,positive,overall excellent movie can be a little slow paced at times but it picks up in the second half and really immerses you into this strange universe a must see on the biggest screen possible 
Oct 27 2021,negative,long and boring most of the film is showed in the dark sometimes you cant see the faces cause the sun is the enemy sometimes you cant even see their faces
Oct 27 2021,positive,it was a good movie and i liked the story line but there were just some parts of the movie that were really slow and took too long to build up
Oct 27 2021,positive,a great movie adaptation of one of the best scifi books ever made solid cast and stays pretty true to the books
Oct 27 2021,negative,a low embrace for future sequence too many ideas take you deep into confusion poor concep on line of conversation in most of the dialog an over talking by sound effects 
Oct 27 2021,positive,this amazing piece of work is hindered by the fact that theres no sequel in the works  the cinematography is great facilitating immensely the immersion theres some deviations from the source material and a lot is left out but this movie gives a very low entry barrier to new fans
Oct 27 2021,positive,i really enjoyed this movie it felt like a story thats bigger than star wars like theres a much deeper mythology behind everything like the first half of the movie they basically were trying to break everything down  explain the mythology introduce the environments characters  then the second half was where they had almost all of the action the cast was amazing timothee chalamet jason momoa rebecca ferguson oscar isaac dave bautista josh brolin zendaya  even polkadot man cant ever remember his name  ive gotta say my favorite performance was probably jason momoa or ferguson throughout the whole movie i couldnt stop comparing it to star wars because it does seem like a star wars type story but without trying to compete with it its almost like how we have coke  pepsi where its similar but not the same i feel like people will start making discussions about star wars vs dune almost like marvel vs dc even tho they both have the same feeling theyre different stories also the pacing somehow felt slow in the beginning when it felt slow but i was so into the storytelling in the first half that i didnt notice how much time had passed until i looked at my phone  saw half of the movie had already passed is dune better than star wars i cant say because this is one movie against multiple movies  shows but i will say that i do think this movie is better than a new hope which i know a lot of people will take offense to that but the storytelling  how much they were able to tell in the span of an hour in a perfect way is just insane  its not even overwhelming like they were able to pace the story so well to where you can understand everything theyre saying just fine  i was worried when the 1st hour passed  there was no action but then i realized that the 1st hour didnt need any action at all because of how good insight they gave to the whole story im definitely rewatching this on hbo max so that we can get a part 2 as soon as possible because i want to learn so much more about these characters  these worlds  if youre going into this movie trying to get fast action with a space theme then youre probably going to be disappointed because thats not what dune is at all tbh i expected that too but me not being a casual movie watcher was able to dive into the story  enjoy it  appreciate the world thats just now getting started i also want to say that i havent read any of the books or watched the mini series  movie i went into this only with the trailers in mind  i feel like if the first dune movie was recieved positively then this wouldve been a franchise equivalent to star wars  star trek because this movie just gave the story that potential  they better have denis come back to direct because the way he sees this story  envisions it is what this story needs to become a franchise
Oct 27 2021,positive,the next big line of movies starts with dune
Oct 27 2021,negative,majority of the movie was talking 3 was action very disappointing
Oct 27 2021,positive,great movie very loyal to the books
Oct 27 2021,positive,the special effects  was awesome  the cinematography was beautiful acting top notch  wonderfully directed  great movie
Oct 27 2021,positive,as good as the original 80s movie just the ending wasnt solid
Oct 27 2021,negative,this movie was terrible  boring  no action and you cant barely make out what they are saying dont waste your money
Oct 27 2021,negative,couldnt understand the dialogue on most and i mean most of the movie    i guess this isnt my type of movie
Oct 27 2021,positive,i havent read the dune books but i enjoyed this movie i absolutely hated the original version made in the 80s and found it hard to follow however the new version was not available not only well done but much easier for me to follow the music and cinematography were excellent the characters were well developed and the themes were rich i particularly appreciated the ending scenes where the young heir to the house leadership learned to follow his inner guidance and displayed strength and compassion in the face of great personal challenge
Oct 27 2021,positive,i like this new version cant wait for part 2 besides i have seen the older version of this movie it does follow the older one
Oct 27 2021,positive,great first adaptation of the book
Oct 27 2021,positive,perfect half of a movie how long for part 2
Oct 27 2021,negative,i feel like i was tricked into watching a warindustrial disney film felt rushed but somehow way too long
Oct 27 2021,positive,this movie must be seen in theaters absolutely movie of the year
Oct 27 2021,positive,saw  grew up with the original  so i went in skeptical can the remake live up i can say without a doubtthis movie delivered fantastic  epic  what star wars movies used to be highly recommend 
Oct 27 2021,positive,absolutely shocked at how much i loved this movie world building at its best cant wait to watch multiple times before part 2 
Oct 27 2021,positive,thought movie was great great direction and well actedthis is an intricate story that takes time to tell beautiful surreal look tremendous musical scoremovie is just opening the door to dune world
Oct 27 2021,positive,as far as half a movie goes this was pretty great
Oct 27 2021,positive,its was absolutely amazing no dull moments at all everything made sense
Oct 27 2021,positive,i think this is a great scifi story and film they did herberts masterpiece justice
Oct 27 2021,positive,somewhat true to the original book did not feel like 25 hours well done
Oct 27 2021,positive,the movie was fine and looked nice but doesnt add anything new to the formula beyond a teenage romance between the main character and a mexican girl    the music made some baffling choices and the ending was dissatisfying  but once the movie is completed after part ii it could be one of the better versions of this story
Oct 27 2021,negative,horrible movie  there was no set up whatsoever for the storyline  it just jumped right in so anyone who isnt familiar with dune is completely lost    dont waste your time on this junk
Oct 27 2021,positive,incredible enjoyed every moment of it
Oct 27 2021,positive,loved how they told the story some elements could of been ecolained better for new fans but great movie overall
Oct 27 2021,positive,as perfect as a dune part one can get absolutely loved it
Oct 27 2021,positive,preface i have read the book someone who is not familiar with the source material may have a different experience    this movie inspired me to make an account and leave a review its a fourstar film but a fivestar theatre experience the sights and sounds are truly unbelievable see this on the biggest screen you can    the cast all did an impressive job especially rebecca ferguson as jessica the direction was solid they found the perfect tone for dune the costumes sets and space ship designs were all inspired and very interesting to look at    unfortunately not every character felt fully developed this led to a few greatly reduced emotional payoffs however major story moments are executed tremendously well and are thrilling to watch    highly recommended for fans of science fiction game of thrones star wars and lawrence of arabia
Oct 27 2021,positive,if youre a scifi fan or enjoyed the novel its well worth seeing far better than the version attempted about 20 years ago or so well acted  interesting story and good convincing special effects
Oct 27 2021,positive,gorgeous cinematically and absolutely worth watching on imax screens very closely follows the story from the 1984 movie which is worth watching before very refreshing to have an artful film that takes its time to marinate within the story and visuals instead of typical hollywood balls to the walls style villenueve one of the best directors out right now
Oct 27 2021,positive,this movie really wowed me i never read the books so i didnt have any expectations going in except the stunning visuals from the trailer the story and acting all were really well done my only qualm was the audio in some parts made it hard to understand dialogue
Oct 27 2021,positive,this was fantastic  i loved the books and it seems much love was put into this  the 1st book could easily be an entire season of a show for all the detail available to show
Oct 27 2021,positive,very well produced and written its just the end felt like the movie was just starting reminded me a lot of star wars 
Oct 27 2021,positive,dark movie without concrete foundation of purpose
Oct 27 2021,positive,dune ive read the book and seen everything made surrounding it the previous moviesmini series just couldnt bring it to life like this latest version villeneuve put in the story telling so those who havent read the book wouldnt be lostlike in the 1984 version great cast intense and fun to watch yet i kind of miss the over the top characters from the 1984 version the cinematography is incredible so if you can catch this on imax itll be worth it im glad they took the time to split this into two movies there is such a deep and compelling story to tell and its just not possible to do it right in a single movie must see movie without a doubt the next one doesnt come out for a couple of years so i recommend the book if you havent read it it will amplify all the imagery for you enjoy
Oct 27 2021,positive,beautiful cinematography well written and exceptional acting
Oct 27 2021,positive,saw dune part 1 on imax today amazing denis villeneuve is such a great director blade runner 2049 arrival sicario prisoners this movie covers topics ranging from political power violence environment resources culture free will and fate all in a high concept science fiction setting this is not star wars but a thinking persons scifi story the film is beautifully shot with many real sets practical effects and real locations with some cgi of course the music score by hans zimmer fits the world perfectly the acting for the most part is very well done by timothee chalamet rebecca ferguson oscar isaac javier bardem sharon duncanbrewster and stellan skarsgard jason momoa is fine but kind of reminds me of aquaman in a desert suit although there is definitely some action in this movie it takes its time telling the story without being overly drawn out i felt everything was well explained which is great for people that are unaware of the story or the books my only complaint is that there were times where i thought the dialogue got lost in the mix making it hard to hear certain lines or parts of conversations but thats it this movie is the reason i still get excited to go to a movie theater its meant to be seen on the big screen i also read the book and i cant envision this story being adapted any better than this loved it
Oct 27 2021,positive,pretty much the same story for the 3rd time but with much better effects
Oct 27 2021,positive,what a film it was mega
Oct 27 2021,negative,too long how come characters still died even w force field was on
Oct 27 2021,positive,excellent waiting for the next addition in  the series
Oct 27 2021,positive,loved everything about this movie it was big and action packed the time went by way to fast cant wait for part 2
Oct 27 2021,positive,it felt like we watched a 2 hour preview the musicsound effects were awesome though
Oct 27 2021,positive,just freaking amazing ive seen it 3 times already dune is my favorite book series and this first movie was just so well done its amazing how accurate the story is to the book
Oct 27 2021,positive,excellent film in every way possible great casting great cinematography great interpretation of the source material
Oct 27 2021,positive,intriguing story with realistic graphic that kind of remind me of star wars as a star wars fans and growing up with the dune from the pc game i enjoy the movie very much looking forward for the part two
Oct 27 2021,positive,loved it can not wait for part two
Oct 27 2021,positive,i expected so much better it just went on and on and never really anything very intersting happened  maybe i just didnt underatand it but i was just bored out of my mind to the point of wanting to walk out in the middle of it didnt thought
Oct 27 2021,positive,beautiful imagery but i wish the plot had concluded
Oct 27 2021,positive,well laid out excellent adaptation of the original book
Oct 27 2021,positive,great movie have to pay attention though or you will miss important detail
Oct 27 2021,positive,the story tracked well with my memory of the book but my wife who hasnt said she had difficulty following the plot    enjoyed acting and visual effects sound was very bass heavy for our tastes theater lobby is depressing needs serious remodeling screen room hallway was very dirty considering we paid close to 30 for 2 tickets     will look for sequel but will most likely watch at home
Oct 27 2021,positive,the sweeping panoramic views set the scene for epic battles and survival scenes
Oct 27 2021,positive,spectacular movie that has me super intrigued to see more
Oct 27 2021,negative,absolutely boring meandering slow i couldnt care less about the characters or the story
Oct 27 2021,positive,fantastic part one even more excited to see part two the storytelling and world were exceptional
Oct 27 2021,positive,it was a fantastic ride
Oct 27 2021,positive,i was very surprised and refreshed at the fact that they took so much time to follow the book and make the scenes authentic i had concerns with the choices they made concerning dr keynes being a woman and jason m playing duncan i hope duncan gets more into character if he is resurrected like in the book in future movies if you havent read the books you wont have a clue of what i just said  i also hope they add much more to the musical score than those woman chanting to a middle eastern musical vibe although it went with the movie there should of been more musical changes to fit the scenes instead of constantly reverting back to the moaning and chanting the ending was off as well chani saying this is just the beginning was full of unnecessary cheese seems  a bit more thought could of went into something as important as the ending i did like how they gave jessica a lot more depth and emotion although i dont think a benne gesserit would have that kind of emotion but then againshe did disobey the order and had a male instead of a female so maybe just that fact that she did feel love for duke leto would give credence to those emotions  i like the bagpipes and how they took the time to show calladen the story of the emperors jelousy was told very well that glimpse of emperical sardakar training was awesome  i hope yall were paying attention to pauls visions i look forward to the next movie for sure
Oct 27 2021,positive,i love that the movie stayed true to the book i just hate i have to wait for the next movie
Oct 27 2021,neutral,long and drawn out kept waiting for it to get better waste of a super cast without that super cast no one would have watched it
Oct 27 2021,negative,the worst movie ever
Oct 27 2021,negative,too longdidnt keep my attention
Oct 27 2021,positive,go watch this in theaters before its too late
Oct 27 2021,negative,1 star just for the acting 
Oct 27 2021,positive,visually stunning from scenery to costumes just outstanding  its hard science fiction and that is hard to adapt on its own and i think a very good job was done  there hasnt been a movie in the last 2 years that i really wanted to see at the theater and glad i did up until this one  home viewing wouldnt do it justice
Oct 27 2021,negative,unwatchable left the theater early
Oct 27 2021,positive,we totally  the movie dune cant wait until the next one comes out in october 2023
Oct 27 2021,positive,the movie is really close to the book mixing action and contemplative scenes the casting is excellent in particular chalamet paul and fergusson jessica are amazing the aesthetic of villeneuve seals the deal simply beautiful
Oct 27 2021,positive,visually perfect and true to the source    but the leads are too boring gen z much
Oct 27 2021,negative,dull slow and lifeless worst ive seen in a long time
Oct 27 2021,positive,there is a creative new way to introduce the plot and develop the characters  great audio and visual effects
Oct 27 2021,positive,this was a great movie
Oct 27 2021,positive,finally someone has written a great screenplay for a book that was once deemed impossible to write cant wait for part 2 and i hope many more
Oct 27 2021,positive,this movie is a paragon of adaptation sticking incredibly closely to the source material and making only the changes necessary to deliver the same emotional beats on the big screen it is the masterpiece denis villeneuve was born to film making his previous work look like practice by comparison the few parts i didnt like or made me uncomfortable were taken directly from the book which made me feel the same way reading them and instead of being drawbacks only serve to make the film a better adaptation and it manages to convey convoluted political intrigue with ease due in no small part to the outstanding acting which is second only perhaps to the cinematography    closest comparison its like blade runner by way of ad astra    setting scifi  plot political intrigue  tone arthouse drama
Oct 27 2021,positive,true to the book and well produced
Oct 27 2021,negative,just all over the place should be done as a hbo series or something similar just to much content in the books to adapt to a couple of films
Oct 27 2021,positive,perfect in every way visuals sound cast and story was a 1010
Oct 27 2021,positive,i  it saw it with my granddaughter she  it too
Oct 27 2021,positive,amazing scifi movie it lived to the expectations
Oct 27 2021,positive,felt like basically a prologue to about eight more movies  liked the actors  plot was okay  but way too loud
Oct 27 2021,positive,good but long i dunno if ill see the next one 
Oct 27 2021,positive,part 1  very enjoyable good character development amazing scenes  will see the next one for sure
Oct 27 2021,negative,practically no dialogue and significant lack of character building the movies is one redeeming factor was the cinematography but i wanted a movie not a glorified instagram story maybe cut the the dream sequences of zendaya down to 2 and focus on the relationships of the characters that way i could care if three important characters die its too bad i wont watch the second movie in theatre 100 maybe even not on a streaming platform if it shows up
Oct 27 2021,positive,hope we dont have to wait years for part 2
Oct 27 2021,positive,casting was perfect acting was amazing it paces slowly at times but for a movie rich in story telling it fits very true to the book from what ive seen
Oct 27 2021,positive,the film is stunning and has great special effects the story felt rushed a bit and never got a real feel for the characters like i had in the previous version
Oct 27 2021,negative,i opted to watch it on hbo max and agreed it needs to be seen on the big screen the visuals are beautiful when you can actually see the screen there were some dim lighting however the movie is excruciatingly slow not much happened and served more as a introduction long exposition to explain this dystopia world so when the movie ends abruptly it didnt leave me wanting more it was very unsatisfying if the movie marketed itself as part one knowing there would be a part two to complete the story maybe i wouldve thought differently     the movie just feels incomplete the pace is an issue which made me forget what the plot was about the actors were fine zendayas role is more of a cameo a lot of the color actors roles were oddly in service to the white characters nice visuals but oof the story and pacing are bad
Oct 27 2021,positive,very good at following storyline and spectacular effects wanted to see more but need to wait for part 2
Oct 27 2021,positive,certainly better than the lynch 1984 version good special effects follows the book with big gaps coud be better held together and storyline more direct
Oct 27 2021,positive,loved it far better than the lynch version cant wait for the 2nd part
Oct 27 2021,positive,stunning audio score breathtaking visuals this is the proper ways to honor an epic of this magnitude   this presentation is part 1  i am expecting 2 more at least  take someone you care about you will not regret it
Oct 27 2021,negative,dune was a disappointment for me almost all shots were filmed in dark and smoky settings and hard to understand some dialog the actors did a good job but did not have much to work with watch the previous movie of dune to be entertained
Oct 27 2021,positive,great cinematography this is  part one of a 2 part sequel pretty accurate to the book could have fleshed out the effect the spice has in regards to folding space more with some nice special effects leaves you cant wait to see part ii feelingwhen it is over
Oct 27 2021,positive,i am so happy that the movie never feels rushed or takes cheap shortcuts  this is a lavish telling of the book and has been given the respect it deserves  once deemed unfilmable this adaption shows the best effort yet to translate the story from the page to the big screen  speaking of the big screen this is a movie that absolutely has to be seen on the biggest screen possible  tiny details are crammed into every available inch of the screen that would be lost on anything short of a 96 tv screen  this movie is a grand epic and i cant wait for he 2nd part of the story to be told shown  i will always throw my dollars to a theater over a tv presentation or ugh an iphone  this movie is an experience that cant be had on a small screen
Oct 27 2021,positive,they finally did it best movie adaptation of a book ever
Oct 27 2021,positive,great movie my husband told me about it and i was not familiar with the book as he was we went to watch it over the weekend  how can any movie go wrong with timothée chalamet in it according to my husband the novel is hard to bring to a movie cannot wait until dune 2
Oct 27 2021,positive,nicely adapted movie followed the book fairly well im good with the poetic license used with the duncan idaho and liet kynes characters as well as the overall story line top notch visual effects i consider it an owner looking forward to part 2
Oct 27 2021,positive,the best dune adaptation i have seen epic is scope and at no point did i think that scene looks fake  some big companies have their reviewers throw hate at it saying its boring or insert lame excuse not to see it but it is a drama and this part of the movie is really just explaining the world and and background before the real action begins it ends after the fight with jamis which is like 45 minutes into most other dune movies its like judging the whole hobbit on its action when you have only watched the parts until bilbo has just left the shire the story is epic and action packed i hope he gets to the children i want to see leto iis transformation and powers  i am here for all his movies
Oct 27 2021,positive,a movie of this caliber has not been released for years with an amazing score stunning otherworldly visuals a high degree of faith to the source material and a careful attention to detail comparable to the lord of the rings trilogy dune is bound to become one of the alltime greatest scifi movie adaptations
Oct 27 2021,positive,finally a movie worthy of the original source material just cant wait for the second part
Oct 27 2021,positive,best version to date a must see for scifi fans
Oct 27 2021,positive,amazing i have waited a long time for a scifi of this caliber so glad i was able to catch it in imax at the legendary chinese theater sound was off the hook i was either on the edge of my seat or holding my breath for more the half this film
Oct 27 2021,positive,absolutely bloody phenomenal
Oct 27 2021,positive,awesome visual effects
Oct 27 2021,positive,something something bad mixing is the dialogue killer in all seriousness thats the worst thing i have to say about this movie its a real lordoftherings type of adaptation where the aesthetic clearly been made more dont say dumbed down dont say dumbed down relatable in a modern eye while also preserving the important stuff from the source material close to every damn shot is a eyestealer even if your ears will be straining to keep up with the accompanying character beats
Oct 27 2021,positive,the classic story of dune on the big screen with fantastic acting and amazing visuals if you read the books youll love this first part of the first book and youll be hoping for part 2 to be green lit asap i didnt mind most of the changes to the story because the essential spirit and story of frank herberts dune is still there  if youre new to the dune universe you wont feel left in the dark wondering whats happening the movie explains things for the newbies and pays homage to the scifi nuts like myself that remember reading the books and imagined seeing a giant sand worm
Oct 26 2021,positive,visually stunning unique and moving story that is a welcome entry into the scifi genre faithful to frank herberts original novel
Oct 26 2021,positive,loved the movie and really enjoyed the fact that the whole book was not crammed into one movie it should be at least two   didnt like jason momoa dying though
Oct 26 2021,positive,an amazing part 1 telling the story with breathtaking audio and visual style
Oct 26 2021,positive,wowscifi at its best cant wait for part2
Oct 26 2021,positive,its the best noooo disappointment very happy ending
Oct 26 2021,positive,nice 2 get out and see a good movie thanx
Oct 26 2021,negative,i slept during most of movie which was the best part of seeing dune because it was the worst movie i have ever seen
Oct 26 2021,positive,ive never seen the original just heard about it  i didnt know what to expect but i thought it  was really good considering ready for part 2
Oct 26 2021,positive,a little  confusing at the beginning once it got about an hour into the movie it was really good
Oct 26 2021,positive,this is beyond well done it is unbelievable  the scope of the presentation takes you on a journey to these worlds                the vision denis has is unsurpassed here for this epic tale  i could have watched all day  bravo    so worth the wait bring on the other parts
Oct 26 2021,positive,this film has great visuals and amazing score you might need a quick summary before watching so you can appreciate everything else
Oct 26 2021,positive,loved it go see it    i want a part 2
Oct 26 2021,positive,i hope they get to make part two
Oct 26 2021,positive,i loved it phenomenal
Oct 26 2021,positive,i have never opened the books and walked into the imax theater having seen only the trailer drop dead serious highly intelligent mystical scifi  its absolutely fair to call this the scifi counterpart to lord of the rings      do not walk into this thinking you will see a star wars harry potter or marvel movie its politics religion and cultures are interwoven and treated very seriously  something none of those movies do  fingers crossed part 2 builds on the story constructed thus far
Oct 26 2021,positive,the visuals the score and the excellent adaptation of the complex and extensive source material of dune are a stroke of genius this movie is worth every penny
Oct 26 2021,positive,5050 however easier to understand than the 1984 film
Oct 26 2021,positive,a dramatic and pleasing film which often felt like a whole lot of nothing the world and story of dune is tried and tested but thats not a bad thing this is a very personal story in a spicy melodramatic world which takes some time to feel comfortable in the cinematography soundtracks visual effects and costume design are all fantastic and help envelope you in this world and the events taking place however there are a lot of characters who seem to serve no real purpose in the arc  and if they do it feels miniscule the film overall while enticing leaves me wanting a whole lot more after an anticlimactic ending its not exactly game of thrones star wars or lord of the rings but it certainly takes aspects from each of these in different ways the film feels much ado about nothing but has earned my interest and future sequels will certainly change my feelings toward this film entirely
Oct 26 2021,positive,visually stunning adaptation that is remarkably close to the source material those after light hearted action should avoid as this is a slow mood piece for adults if you have patience and want something epic that respects the audiences intelligence then youll love dune
Oct 26 2021,positive,great movie amazing visuals and soundtrack dont come in expecting a complete story because you will be disappointed since this is part 1 of 2 but enjoy the movie for what it is and immerse yourself in the world of dune
Oct 26 2021,negative,they should have already shot part 2 nothing was said about the secret weapon or the weirding way the author is turning in his grave but his estate is making out like a bandit at the box office
Oct 26 2021,positive,loved this in the theater in 3d
Oct 26 2021,neutral,just like so many other movies concisecompression of a classic is eschewed in favor of a multirelease format to improve profitability and increase sales of post production dvds and remainder sales    special effects receive a 6 out of 10 possible  casting receives 5 out of 10 possible  musical score receives a solid 7 out of 10 possible
Oct 26 2021,positive,visually stunning excellent world building perfectly cast cant wait for part 2 
Oct 26 2021,positive,i fell asleep it was overlong and could have done with more editing and fewer fight sequences nice ken adams type grey concrete sets
Oct 26 2021,negative,for me this lacked the depth intrigue and imagination of the original and it was an effort to stay the course i wont be viewing any further films in this series
Oct 26 2021,positive,great part 1 i hope theres a part 2 in my lifetwime
Oct 26 2021,positive,so bummed now i have to wait for part 2 the movie was outstanding with the story line  the different tribes cant wait for part 2
Oct 26 2021,positive,i have always loved the dune books  loved the first movies this dune compared well i loved the acting casting exciting pace  i held my breath at times great job  cant  wait for dune part 2
Oct 26 2021,negative,my wife and i took in dune this afternoon  it was a big disappointment in that the members of the cast have performed so wellbrilliantly evenin previous movies    but i didnt care about any of them and the fault lay in the pretentious script that relied more on overblown technology set sound effects and a portentous score than on a wellconstructed plot and relationships that mattered the dialogue is just shallow with one false note after another   in fact after awhile the movie seemed silly a parody of itself the fine young lead timothee chalamet mugging looking handsome and earnest and full of a mission that never seems significant enough  and all of the obvious anachronismssophisticated personal electronic shields and flying machines coupled with tribes armed with knives and swords racing to do battle like something out of the middle ages  maybe you have responded or will respond differently to this mess  we got in for a bargain matinee but it was still overpriced
Oct 26 2021,positive,amc projector was out of collimation by about 5 pixels most noticeable during subtitles
Oct 26 2021,positive,so awesome one of the first movies ive seen based on a book that really makes me want to read the book and get more info on the characters themes and scenes already seen the movie twice and making my way through the first book now
Oct 26 2021,positive,i enjoyed this movie and it was much better than i expected the special effects cinematography and acting was exceptional    i am a huge fan of robert herberts novel and i felt like many themes were addressed and it followed the first half of the book fairly well
Oct 26 2021,neutral,in its crawlling nearly threehour runtime the 2021 adaptation of dune does little to establish the universe or its characters  i should disclose that i have not yet read the book so im not comparing the film to something i think is better im only judging this film on its own merits    the biggest flaw in this version of dune is its lack of character development  we know nothing of the characters beyond their role in the plot if even that  such is most true of paul the main protagonist  without knowing any of his motivations or internal struggles the main conflict doesnt feel significant  that isnt helped out by the second biggest problem story structure  this is only half of the story in the novel but with almost nothing established it seems so pointless  the ball doesnt get rolling until halfway through and it doesnt culminate towards any payoff  much of this is due to the third biggest issue editing    especially after reading that the original cut of this movie was longer than four hours its baffling how the two and a half that were left with lack basic character growth yet contain so much filler  transistions between scenes contain what feels like several minutes of beautiful establishing shots of space ships that ultimately serve no purpose other than to look cool  even the editing within scenes is jarring  there are jump cuts during dialogue scenes and the rhythm of the cuts overall is too fastpaced for such a slowpaced story    before i acknowledge the positives id like to nitpick one more thing  hans zimmers music is generic hollywoods stereotypical middleeastern sounds anytime a movie goes into the desert  just as many of his other scores its obnoxious and distracting    now the things i liked about this movie are really only the cinematography and sound design  although i cant recall any standout shot composition the lighting and color palette have that smooth atmospheric quality youd expect from a dennis villeneuve film  the sound effects really show off in kind of a good way  i dont really know what to say about the sounds other than i simple liked them    well thats about it  im not disappointed as dune fan but i am disappointed as dennis villeneuve fan  this movie just doesnt have enough going for its characters and story to justify even a shorter feature
Oct 26 2021,positive,does not really explain what is going or why
Oct 26 2021,positive,the spice must flow    pros good writing interesting plot solid acting performances all around unique costume designs and beautiful cinematography    cons slow pacing issues some of the characters should have had more screentime and the major plot needed some extra build up time    overall great film looking forward to part 2
Oct 26 2021,negative,too much like star wars
Oct 26 2021,positive,this movie attempted to be the new star wars and i must say that they might have accomplished their first step towards that feat 
Oct 26 2021,positive,i am a massive fan of the books and i think this is the best dune adaptation to date  im not going to tell you what i liked im going to tell you what i missed  1 the movie is pretty slow and they try to make it serious but the tone wasnt really working for me  i dont remember any part of the movie where there wasnt any noises in the background  by noise i mean music but its not music its noise  it gets irritating  they could have broken up the movie a bit and made it slightly more interesting at points by using scenes from the book that they skipped like the dinner party scene  i understand that based on how much time they had some things had to be sacrificed  as for the tone it seems like its one of worry they tried to drive home the gravity of the situation but for me it didnt feel like it was dire  more like a confused worry  the duke should have shown more confidence with the exception of that one scene with jessica paul was good but his character was a bit more confident probably driven by the slight change in the story line yueh had no depth neither did thufir duncan was probably the best character in the movie gurney the second  paul was alright though again he just seemed out of it most of the movie  they could have done more to bring more emotion out of timothee  the most important part of the books to me was the intellectual side  the plans within plans  this is lacking big time  one of the major things i missed was the grand shots there really werent many if any at all  its one of the only things i really liked of the new starwars movies  force awakens you have these amazing shots of the desert the inside of the star destroyer the xwings going over the water  not really that great in dune  just to finish again i already said i am being hyper critical it was the best dune movie to date hands down  i look forward to watching part 2 in 2023
Oct 26 2021,positive,see it on imax if you can
Oct 26 2021,positive,not only does this film capture the audience with its breathtaking and masterful cinematography but honors the written word of frank herbert in some scenes to the letter i went in with very high expectations having read the book and become enthralled with the ahead of its time world building and character development and was skeptical that it would be a hit with such a stacked cast of big box office names i think overall the characters were cast correctly and the chemistry between oscar issac and timothee chalamet was beautiful it made what could have a basic scene between father and son a relatable and deep conversation of love trust and the unforeseen future the production design was mindblowing and the fashion of the future is something id happily sign up for today regardless of your opinion or stand on mr villeneuves blade runner 2049 i think this is a masterful work i am overjoyed to say the least that the second installment of the film was green lit today
Oct 26 2021,negative,absolutely disappointing and mostly boring
Oct 26 2021,positive,im about to speak personal blasphemy as someone who saw the original star wars in the movie theater 37 times when i went to see empire strikes back it had a lot to live up to i knew basically the premise and star wars as it was known then had changed my life and what a movie could be then empire strikes back blew my little mind the dune movie is as good as empire strikes back if you have read the book go see it in the theater see the imax version and if possible see the imax 4d version it blew my mind i am now watching it a second time on hbo max and i will see it in the theater again this weekend
Oct 26 2021,positive,there is absolutely no way that we can get a better adaptation of frank herberts scifi masterpiece the performances from timothée chalamet rebecca ferguson and even jason mamoa were amazing the visuals were astounding seriously it may be my favorite scifi film of all time even surpassing any of the star wars films im definitely adding this film to my bluray collection and digital collection bring on pt ii
Oct 26 2021,positive,dune proves that denis villeneuve is one of the greatest directorial talents working today
Oct 26 2021,positive,im intrigued to see where this goes
Oct 26 2021,positive,the movie was a visual marvel the expanse of the scenes and detail were from another world i have watched lynchs dune many times so i was already a big fan but this version is what scifi should be the next star wars will have to up its game to even come close cant wait till the next dune to complete the story
Oct 26 2021,positive,i was nervous going into dune after reading some of the reviews i know nothing about the story so figured i would be lost realized i need to stop reading critics reviews the story was amazing the graphics insane and the acting was good some performances better than others cant wait to finish the story
Oct 26 2021,negative,beautiful but boring an excellent 90 minutes worth of content crammed into only 155 minutes the good news is you can fall asleep while watching and not miss anything
Oct 26 2021,positive,very true to the novel  herberts vision  realistic special effects thopters sandworms stillsuits were especially good looking forward to the sequel it could have a game of thrones future
Oct 26 2021,positive,i just come home from the theater and i loved it i have read a few reviews from here and i really didnt understand what people didnt like about this movie it has beautiful scenes an interesting soundtrack and i think a suitable cast really enjoy this movie recommend watching it on the big screen
Oct 26 2021,negative,i am not a science fiction kind of person  was very slowmost of the movie was in darkness  my grandson 15 didnt like it either
Oct 26 2021,positive,alot more detailed than the original movie which i liked looking forward to part 2
Oct 26 2021,positive,this version contained elements form the book that previous movie versions overlooked and yet had  a new twist on familiar things
Oct 26 2021,positive,fantastic finally a movie that captures the epic feeling of the book
Oct 26 2021,negative,such a lack luster movie seems like it was made purposely to make sequels to get as much money as they can out of it could have been made for the scyfy channel as one of there cheesy scifi movies and it ends abruptly not wanting more just disappointed that you waisted your time on it 
Oct 26 2021,positive,awesome movie its not only complete respect to the original work book series but also a spectacular view of the universe of dune    denis villeneuve does his best in this movie all the main characters are there doing their best timothée chalamet rebecca ferguson jason momoa oscar issac josh brolin and sharon duncanbrewster    i cant wait for the continuation
Oct 26 2021,positive,155 minutes filled with too much of nothing and way too little of anything else
Oct 26 2021,positive,my only complaint is that now i have to wait for part 2 this movie was spectacular it really followed  much of the actual book in detail that was not disappointing
Oct 26 2021,positive,it fits my interest in scifi  great effects in it  long  too bad it is only part 1
Oct 26 2021,negative,beautiful imagery no depth outside of this
Oct 26 2021,positive,amazing storytelling and cinematography are epic
Oct 26 2021,neutral,weve settled for the vanilla and flaccid storytelling the tired devices dialogue and familiar faces only disney can give us its a pathetic and sad indictment of our current desperately needy pursuit of comfort which unfortunately portrays us as trappedlike neo engines of consuming whose information is traded daily like market stocks caught up in cookiecutter serialdriven hollywood machinations that produce this type of placating cinema it has become our national entertainment fare    from the opening score we find ourselves on the star wars landscape we are looking into the faces of familiar actors donning different garb but we know them and our warmfuzzy subconscience follows with us soothing our discomforts calming us against any establishing shots opening confusion we dont have to think we are not provoked by our uneasiness or disquietude with strange beginnings we are never challenged    this is not so with the work of david lynchs dune  from the beginning we are suspended in space with nothing to hold on to i was at my local premiere of this movie we were given a syllabus as we stepped past the ticket booth it was unsettling from the moment we walked into the theatre and i believe the directoreraserhead and studio intended that from the start    and i didnt realize till years later what the head of our halfway house clyde burtram was trying to do he had known that david lynchs premiere was something we would all look back on in awe as a milestone in our recovery  jodorowsky couldnt achieve completing dune and had said it couldnt be adapted but looking back on david lynchs work i realize the guts it took and the sacrifice lynch made to give the story quality i like stings and jose ferras work in this version i am drawn to the mystery of the benijesuits order the political intrigues and the dangers in the lives of those who wield power it was as grand an event as any i had been a part of over the 23 years of my life at that time i remember the whole night even comments made to me by the housemate sitting next to me    i want my entertainment to provoke me to challenge me to imagine i want it to impose ideas upon me that will be lifechanging and stir creativity within me i want the movie ive invested a portion of my leisure time to to evoke in me a sense of wonder at life and all its multifaceted dimensions i want it to make me erupt in either crying or laughing uproariously  i am an artist an everevolving creature who revels in the impulsive explosion to create something alive with a life of its own something beating with a pulse villeneuves work is disneyderivative right down to the soundtrack its a shame how money is corrupting even our entertainment making us a house pet who goes back to the same bowl of canned food over and over and over
Oct 26 2021,negative,this movie is the definition of a bad movie a big box office bad why is it so horrible all the actors i like it is watchable for the actors and some of the visual clarity of action    i do not like the fact that they used images from sequels in the trailers what you do begin to see is presented as though maybe you already expect it the characters are under delivered shadow representations of something  that you can feel you might have had to known first to understand the plot is simplified to such a degree that without knowing anything it is difficult to care about these characters it is like this is the technical story board only when they die oh well when they betray each other who cares this movie delivers each scene as if it is a retelling of what happened in more detail on the other page then we have a montage before they leave the home planet with loud imposing music it doesnt really communicate the loss that being given this duty of care taking a new world means to this family they are leaving a paradise to live in the desert i have to sit for too long to see nothing but a screen saver of shots that mean nothing to me or seemingly the main character whos development is rushed his arch to leadership is forced the is to accept him as though he did something that was not seen on screen nothing is earned in this film it qualifies as a disasterpiece so much is wrong with it    and seriously not happy for teasing future movies in the trailer yet i no longer even care about it what we got was a dusty rider on a worms back that had no compelling visual imagery at all the one opportunity you had to give us a proud worm riding moment in a big screen way you killed the character before it could happen         dune is a book thats like proust its science fiction but its very very literary jodorowsky told indiewire its very difficult to find images to put in the film because pictures are opticalthe first time they said it was safe to do dune and david lynch did it i was ill because it was my dream they showed the picture in paris and my son said you need to see the picture i was ill to do that ill and then they start to show the picture and step by step i was so happy because it was a shitty picture i realized dune nobody can do it its a legend    from 
Oct 26 2021,positive,incredible visuals phenomenal story
Oct 26 2021,positive,fantastic film that delivered all that was promised and more visually stunning with an oscarworthy score by hans zimmer yes it cut off in the middle of the story but this was always part one of two possibly three
Oct 26 2021,positive,awesome immersive film
Oct 26 2021,positive,it was just so amazing
Oct 26 2021,negative,super slow movie couldve been much better kept waiting for something to happen that never did lol
Oct 26 2021,positive,great movie from a great book
Oct 26 2021,positive,action and entertaining
Oct 26 2021,negative,this movie was so boring they could have done this entire film in 30 min instead choose to film it over 2 and a half hours there really is not more to say i will sum it up in a few sentences family moves to planet farm dune kicks previous family tenets out other family gets mad and kills family family then goes into hiding with neighbors on said planet fade to blackend how this got a audience score of 91 is beyond me
Oct 26 2021,positive,the attention to detail in this movie is absurd the costumes and makeup are unlike anything ive seen before zimmers soundtrack is spine tingling and intense the set pieces are beyond grand the whole movie feels alien and strange it truly feels like youre seeing a story from 10000 in the future not to mention the amount of respect that is given to the source material loved it
Oct 26 2021,positive,great visuals and story telling actors were great stoic mostly but i believe that comes with the environment and atmosphere they were trying to bring across never read the books so cant speak to how accurate it is but i thoroughly enjoyed it and hope the 2nd part comes out best movie of the year for me so far
Oct 26 2021,negative,painfully slow confusing story linenever have i rooted for the bad guys to win so we can end this terrible movie please dont waste your time or money on this movie if you must see it make sure it is on hbo otherwise you will inevitably have to figure out a way to get a refund  save yourself the headache skip this futuristic turd
Oct 26 2021,positive,one of the best sciencefiction adaptations ever created go see it right now
Oct 26 2021,positive,a truly fantastic cinematic experience hard to find a flaw aside from an inconclusive ending pending additional installments in the series  this could go down as one of the great scifi epics of our time
Oct 26 2021,positive,dune was an absolute masterpiece in story sound acting and effects  i was initially afraid the storyline would be difficult to follow because of the scope of the novel but it was easily followed  i was blown away by the experience
Oct 26 2021,positive,this was an absolute masterpiece from the acting to the directing and the the cenemetosrgraphy must be seen in theaters 
Oct 26 2021,negative,they took a great movie and loaded it with countless bullshit and stretched it out so that when you get halfway through the movie it ends i admit the special effects are great the storyline is great it is still is just a remake you got away too skinny of a kid playing paul who could be blown over in the wind there is no way is the one the rest of the cast is great but when you dont hear what the others are thinking like in the original you miss out on so much
Oct 26 2021,positive,the movie did such a good job of staying true to the book but also feeling modern and exciting  acting was a 1010 and cgi was off the charts
Oct 26 2021,positive,this is an almost flawless movie every shot is a work of art and that music helps sell the visulas even if they overuse it and starts to lose its uniqueness towards the end
Oct 26 2021,positive,the years waiting for the book adaptation plus the delays due the pandemic since the movie announcement where tottaly worth it i always dreamed of a movie adaptation since ive read the books and we all knew that it would be an endeavour to do so denis villeneuve knocked out of the park trimming the fat of the book and making it fit on the big screen watching it was a very fulfilling experience and i will be eagerly waiting for part ii
Oct 26 2021,negative,my god is this film terrible  its being praised but i literally couldnt find anything about it that i could imagine anyone enjoying  during the movie roughly 10 people got up and left they did not come back  the film looks beautiful but its literally 2 and a half hours of people pouting and mumbling their words  ive loved denis villeneuves past work but i was so incredibly bored during this one
Oct 26 2021,positive,awesome it was a nice surprise as i did not expect that much of this movie totally worth it cannot wait for the 2nd part
Oct 26 2021,positive,looking forward to sequel
Oct 26 2021,positive,amazing job fully adapting frank herberts vision to film
Oct 26 2021,positive,most groundbreaking film of the year frank herberts dune is a 10 out of 10 for me cant wait for part ii
Oct 26 2021,positive,i really liked the settings and the vastness of the environment having not read the books or have any background of the story i was confused while trying to follow the movie but i enjoyed it going in i knew it was only part 1 so i wasnt expecting a finished product with the movie great movie overall
Oct 26 2021,positive,dune part 1 is undoubtedly one of the best films made in recent years with the care detail and majesty that only a megaproduction like this can have something that has not been seen for a long time in this part of the galaxy reminding me for example of lord of the rings not only because of how well done the movie is made but also because of the plot since i was confused at the beginning by so much lore that is thrown at us at the beginning already like maybe 99 of the people who have gone to see dune and have never read the literary work we went completely blank to see this movie hehe but as the movie progresses you cant help but want to know more about this wonderfully constructed world  and at the end of the film i am left with the feeling of satisfaction that i understood the plot well although the details are still not well basically what happened to me in my first encounter with the lord of the rings hehe but surely when i saw a second one or more sometimes i will understand more about the houses the empire and how all this is connected to each other without a doubt very interesting to see  the most satisfying thing about this is to see that there is still much to do in the film world there is still the possibility of seeing adaptations of books that are not only a cheap attempt to exploit a franchise to subvert expectations to fill fees etc but to satisfy the viewer with such good works and that at least in my thinking it must have been an adaptation that satisfies the staunch fans of dunes original work  a movie that i see from now on shaping up to be among the best fantasy  scifi adaptations ever made inside the ring of lotr hp etc and since it is most likely a trilogy i dont know if it is still confirmed it will enter like those classic movie trilogies it remains to be said that i look forward to the day dune part 2 comes out  completely recommended remember that it is a movie that lasts almost 3 hours so go to the bathroom before entering do not bring small children or babies and if you can enjoy it on an imax screen 
Oct 26 2021,positive,awesome denis left us wanting so much more that i dont know how were gonna survive this next year god forbid it will take more until part 2
Oct 26 2021,negative,so bad that for 145 milion and 156min they told around 40 of the story that dune1984 only succsesfuly show you for 45 milion and 134min of screen time  the movie is hold on only by jason momoa and josh brolin acting everyone els is like reading theyr scripts do not want to be there and most of the cast dont fit theyr characters   visuals are ok but to short or without much detail cgis are only far away shots that most of the time do not contribute to the story much  showing sand and telling its dune do not make the viewer feel it but rather think of it as random desert shot anywhere in the universe on other hand when the movie try to get in to the story of the book it misses everything important and the small details that make the characters and the great houses differenses but succesfuly captures the scope of the conflict and its meaning   fans of the books will get another disappointing movie with super powers in it     summary if you remove dune name and references from the movie you will get mediocre to bad over budget movie with star actors in it    ps if there is next movie it should be done by different people such a waste of money and time
Oct 26 2021,positive,well best dune movie yet as movie went on i realized the end was not going during this movie found a good spot to end this show and preview next movie very well done 
Oct 26 2021,positive,dune was my second scifi love after empire strikes back when i was growing up dune 2021 is a masterwork i was pleased at every note struck  was brought to tears multiple times watching
Oct 26 2021,positive,i enjoyed dune very much it was visually stunning and had great action a great story and plot and was true to herberts book i loved the previously made movie of dune as well this was simply a better version due to enhanced special effects and with a few additional facts if you are looking for pure entertainment to enjoy and escape from your daily lives this is the movie to see plus for people like myself who like to evaluate a movie for the many messages that it offers this is also a great movie from that perspective the actors chosen to play the many characters in the film were also an excellent choice paul and his family members stood out the best as well as jason momoa who is always the perfect actor for playing strong fighters who also have a good heart and show caring for those he is involved with as a protector i look forward to seeing the second part and hope that it will not take to long for it to be distributed since i know who dune ends from the original version i am curious how it will compare to it it was an extremely dynamic ending that invited a lot of discussion as to what really happened
Oct 26 2021,positive,just amazing  as a very longtime fan of the books i can tell you that this is definitively the best adaptation to date adherence to canon was tight without being constrained go see this at the theater
Oct 26 2021,positive,this is for those that look for magic a must see
Oct 26 2021,positive,the book is very hard to adapt and splitting it was a good idea fantastic movie amazing atmosphere the audio and visual part of the movie is flawless the casting and performances pitch peefect bring on part 2 wb
Oct 26 2021,positive,an epic film best seen on the big screen i have seen many sci fi flicks and am not a stranger to grand space flight scenes yet this movie still blew me away the acting and set design was executed to perfection the only critique i have is that it leaves you wanting more the pacing was a little off and it lacked a third and final act with an abrupt ending im excited for the sequel
Oct 26 2021,positive,def a big screen xd flick  phenomenal visuals sounds music
Oct 26 2021,positive,i thought it was great a beautiful film a wonderful realization of very difficult source material i wish it had been even longer to fit in more of the details from the book but i understand that compromises have to be made while not every detail made it in what they did do was convey the core concepts quite well
Oct 26 2021,positive,genius music and storytelling faithful and spirited adaptation
Oct 26 2021,positive,beautifully filmed but sligthly boring  if havent read the book i wouldve been even more bored  also dont go see it in 4dx it destructs you from actually watching the movie save 4dx for a true action feature
Oct 26 2021,positive,as someone who hasnt read the book i was worried that dune would fall into the usual scifi trap where it spends too much time and energy explaining the world to the audience with forced interjections and scenes that dont actually progress the movie    but dune finds the perfect balance of exposition and plot progression and kept me fully immersed and on the edge of my seat for the last 90 min its a slow burn to start that builds up tension and the visuals and cinematography are superb hans zimmer scores the movie beautifully     cant wait for the sequel
Oct 26 2021,positive,very entertaining great cinematography
Oct 26 2021,positive,best movie of the year 
Oct 26 2021,negative,alright here is an honest review from someone with no prior bias or knowledge of the dune books  umm pretty much wasted two and a half hours of my life for an incomplete movie  so basically is not a movie that stands on its own its just a piece of a movie  took one and a half hours for the first fight scene  tons tons and tons of face closeups  they spent truck fulls of dough making the spaceships and cgi looks amazing like star wars but considering there is only maybe 20 minutes of action in this piece im highly unsatisfied  felt like a sucker after 25 hours of this and than if i want to know the ending of the movie i have to wait another 2 years or so for them to even start filming itand from the looks of it i still might not get an end and have to wait another two years after that for another movie if im lucky  movie was made pg13 and i cant picture any of my kids sitting through this  the one fight scene that could have been good ended without even showing how the  character got stabbed and died as camera was from the wrong angle  this is honesty for you hope it saves someone  its pretty its long and mostly boring  i would recommend people watch it after the other movies are out to complete the story if anything  with the amount of money they spent on this probably i could imagine the third movie getting cancelled over bad review if the second one doesnt hit it out of the park
Oct 26 2021,positive,as a fan of the dune universe this was to frank herberts famous series what peter jacksons lord of the rings was to tolkiens master work    not to mention the stunning audio visual experience  i loved every second of this film      i was initially concerned by the casting of timothee chalamet as paul atreides but he won me over and owned that role with commanding presence
Oct 26 2021,positive,spectacular movie making must be seen on the big screen to appreciate the scope of the spectacular sets soundtrack was felt down to the bone incredible story beautifully photographed
Oct 26 2021,positive,its worth the trip to your nearest movie theater see this on the biggest and loudest screen possible
Oct 26 2021,positive,dune was a great time and a fantastic incinema experience having seen it both at home and in theaters its certainly one youll want to see in theaters as the visuals and sounds are brought to the next level it is not an action packed fast paced film but its pacing is good enough to keep you invested some complained about it ending on a cliffhanger but they should have seen that coming as in the opening title card sequence it says clearly that this is part one as to be expected with scifi movies there is some jargon but none if it is abstract enough that you cant understand there meaning with context
Oct 26 2021,positive,i have seen dine twice now and cant get it off my mind it left a eautoful impression i felt immersed in a different world the acting story cinematography were magnificent  the music is a language all its own the relationship between timothée chalamet and rebecca ferguson mother and son is so moving and mysterious loved jason momoa and zendaya although this film was a complete story we clearly have to get dune part 2 we need to see the rest of this epic story
Oct 26 2021,positive,another epic scifi masterpiece from director denis villeneuve must be seen on the biggest screen possible to fully take in the magnitude of this film breathtaking cinematography great story and script fantastic performances and amazing production design as much as i loved it thus is definitely hard scifi that isnt for everyone so if you generally dont like that type of thing proceed with caution but id you do or have an open mind prepare to  e bloom away
Oct 26 2021,positive,just didnt make the cut lacking didnt stick to the original all i kept saying is it over yet
Oct 26 2021,positive,love it cant wait for part ii watching the video where denis explains the gom jabbar scene which was my favorite scene every single detail and thought process that went into every scene made me appreciate the film that much more
Oct 26 2021,positive,the shining example of what a scifi epic should be on the big screen
Oct 26 2021,positive,love it this is how the original shouldve been but i understand that it was difficult during those times
Oct 26 2021,positive,excellent in every aspect except that it cutoff way too early which i am sure was planned to help build momentum for the second movie that i would buy today finally the best science fiction series of the 21st century gets a cast and cgivideo and audio worthy of what will be the next internationally acclaimed sci fi universe
Oct 26 2021,positive,they must make par 2  so go see it please    also it was incredible and scifi fans will appreciate this yes it is on streaming but this is the type of film that is best experience at the cinema with its loud audio and humongous screen
Oct 26 2021,positive,this adaptation of dune was beautiful and epic from the score to the visuals i loved every bit of it cant wait to see how it ends
Oct 26 2021,positive,visually stunning a must see in the theaters for the grand scope and cinematography
Oct 26 2021,positive,the best science fiction film ive seen in a long time the scale of dune is captured so well
Oct 26 2021,positive,there are rare moments in life when you have the opportunity to view a genuine masterpiece on every level music composed by hans zimmer absolutely brilliant and emotionally riveting while seamlessly blending with the on screen scenes and story cinematography is second to none with beautiful canvas shots and picture perfect framing of characters during all instances of dialogue and action the story and plot was effortlessly true to the book written by frank herbert and was fully realized on the screen with real world adaptions to the the in book universe that was imagined by its creator dune isnt just a movie its a fully realized immersive experience that transports you from earth to dune where you live the life of paul and must undergo this journey to realize your destiny or fail to do so it is a movie that will stand the test of time and is the first important slab of the foundation of future dune movies that will only enhance and engage the viewer on a conscious level not ever done in the cinema if you havent seen the film go see it if you dont understand it completely on the first viewing go see it a second time if you love it go see it a third time final verdict go see this film it will change you whether you realize it or not
Oct 26 2021,negative,the worst sci fi movie i ever watched  till the end i dont get any good feelings from this movie i fell asleep twice while watching it why villenueve i love your movies incendies arrival are very enjoyable movies this movie  bad story poor script annoying sound aaaaa aaaa aaaa like every 15seconds
Oct 26 2021,negative,as a huge fan of the books the lynch film and the syfy mini series both of them this is movie was fucking trash it removes everything thats unique and interesting about the world its surface quality only many will say this is a beautiful movie but i found it all pale beige grey washed out colors half the movie is wide angle shots of empty places limnal spaces and the other half is fuckboi visions of a terrible actress did you see the spiderman films the entire cast is miscast especially the mother the father is made to look weak the mother cries way too much for a stoic archbishop of her church she helps him during the box trial dumb af ruins the whole tension and he doesnt even say the mind killer poem she does wtf i mean all of the men are neutered in this film except for aquaman and the bluered visuals of the shielding is annoying as fuck and makes everything under the bluered blurry so all fidelity is lost and fight scenes look like blurs fighting blurs and not in the good way like heroes season 4 ep 1 knife fight with peter vs the circus assassin i could go on and on from the genderrace bending to the absolute droning horns of the soundtrack whoever decided horns on horns on horns would be good should be fired its so full of empty areas empty moments and insignifigant stuff thats not in the books or og renditions it feels like this is what a zoomer who read the cliff notes of dune 10 years ago in college would make as a dune movie paul is emo as fuck while he looks good as a young lord type he lacks the acting ability the emotional range and his outbust on his mom at that scene is so petulent and whiny its like hes basically kylo ren cosplaying as paul atredies its fucking pathetic fuckboi visions is what im gonna call this movie from now on
Oct 26 2021,positive,i didnt read the books and went into the movie totally blind i thought it was an interesting mix of star wars and the lord of the rings
Oct 26 2021,positive,amazing breathtaking i find quite amusing to see that most of the bad reviews this movie got were written by people that were expecting ironman to get out of its cave in the desert 
Oct 26 2021,positive,streamed on  hbomax will definitely go back and see it in the theater on the big screen worth seeing on the big screen
Oct 26 2021,positive,it was great in imax  look forward to part 2
Oct 26 2021,positive,pretty much page to screen it missed one key scene from the book but other than that it was very accurate cant wait for part 2
Oct 26 2021,positive,awesome to see in dolby
Oct 26 2021,positive,easily one of the best movies ive seen in the past few years loved it  im so glad they are breaking it up into 2 movies because it needs it
Oct 26 2021,positive,great movie acting and cinematography are top notch
Oct 26 2021,negative,a boring dreadful movie with great visuals the plot is nonexistent and the acting is on par with a middle school play overhyped and just plain bad dont waste your time
Oct 26 2021,positive,absolutely loooooved it im a huge dune fan and this is incredible i could watch it over and over it again its so so so good just remember everyone this is just part 1 just half the the book so the second half will be in sequel so if you feel it stops abruptly thats because it does its not finished
Oct 26 2021,negative,the movie was hard to follow and the story line confusing
Oct 26 2021,positive,absolutely loved it went in not seeing the original or knowing anything about source material and it was incredible one of the very few movies i finish and am excited for the sequel a bit slow at first but towards the end was on the edge of my seat and felt like it was a great overall pacebuild up throughout given the 230ish run time 
Oct 26 2021,positive,a blockbuster with an authors stamp made for all audiences a cinematographic achievement feat in direction photography editing sound music and acting that only falters in the end which leaves you with a feeling of eternal prologue but lays the foundation for it which must be the future of a memorable and substantial cinematic saga at the level of the masterpiece of the lord of the rings
Oct 26 2021,positive,beautiful cinematography amazing score stayed pretty faithful to the source material and was fairly well paced cant wait for part 2
Oct 26 2021,positive,i really thought i was gonna dislike this seemed to be another scfi revival with a slow boring pace and little to care about blade runner but the pacing was great short sequences and significant with great shots almost like a music video i knew halfway through youre  gonna be left wanting more knowing this is gonna be a trilogy first movie established the story and made you fully buy into the world and story it creates amazing
Oct 26 2021,positive,a very good visual translation of the original book you do t want to compare to the earlier 80s film but rest assured that this one is much better acting visual effects music  its all much better its not all action  the original book wasnt either and its just a part 1 which makes sense since there is so much to cover recommend you see it in theaters to immerse yourself in the overall feel strongly recommend checking it out
Oct 26 2021,positive,really well done and a good representation of the original text the main actor seems a bit young but did well overall truly hoping they get to make the sequel and that they start filming right away ive seen it more than once already
Oct 26 2021,negative,the set design and costuming is great but is that really worth over 2 hours of your time i am not really sure why films like this are made i dont know even one person that is excited to see the start of something that will take literal years to get anywhere this whole movie is like an american idol elimination round you think youll get some sort of conclusion after 20 commercial breaks only to get to the end and realize you have to wait a few more years to see who stays and who goes not worth the time or energy i dont know why i was so excited for this
Oct 26 2021,positive,absolutely incredible movie great pacing in my opinion as there was a lot to take it while watching it i thought this is a movie im going to look back on and remember for a long time visuals are absolutely insane and the soundtrack is just perfect
Oct 26 2021,positive,astonishingly well done storytelling and visual impact great acting of course a lot of the complex plots and interior dialogue from the book are left out but it is in direct service of the movie impact it stays true to the book in the important ways no weirding modules powered by sound for example the second promises to be even more outstanding if in the same hands given the material worth seeing in the theatre the first time for certain
Oct 26 2021,positive,slow and sleepy like many other movies from denis villeneuve   1st book was cut in half yes this is part 12  movie was 235 hours long but felt like the entire movie was a build up but no climax   many great actor but they didnt do much   many unnecessary slow approach that can be edited out be they didnt
Oct 26 2021,positive,faithful and beautiful cannot wait until part 2
Oct 26 2021,positive,this is perhaps one of the most true to original book based movie ever the only reason it stumbles in some peoples eyes is because herbert left a lot open for interpretation in his writing and we all often do not imagine the same thing cant wait for part 2 this movie is sublime
Oct 26 2021,positive,dune was a good movie not great but good visuals were mesmerizing action was breath taking will have you on the edge of your seat trying to figure out what is going on or happen next the story was slow at the beginning but essential for the story telling cant wait for the sequel hopefully more action and less talking
Oct 26 2021,positive,followed 1984 dune great efx  storytelling cant wait for part 2
Oct 26 2021,positive,fantastic in imax  thrilling and beautiful to look at
Oct 26 2021,positive,absolutely the best version of dune out there next to the book
Oct 26 2021,positive,a visually stunning masterpiece
Oct 26 2021,negative,it follows the book very closely but felt slow the music at times felt over dramatic and didnt fit the scene
Oct 26 2021,positive,i doubt well ever get a better adaptation of the books the movie is not 100 true to the books but it gets as close as it can without being a confusing mess for those unfamiliar with frank herberts work      the storytelling is just right for what aspires to be the first of a chain of movies and sets the stage for the next movie if one is made brilliantly ideally this will be a trilogy since there is so much that happens just in the one book this movie doesnt even cover halfway      the visuals are amazing the effects and animations are polished and the acting is superb
Oct 26 2021,positive,outstanding a visual and auditory masterpiece a compelling faithful depiction of the novel that every herbert fan will appreciate
Oct 26 2021,positive,way to long and to be continued no thanks
Oct 26 2021,negative,felt like 2 hours long episode of star wars mandalorian but with less cool weapons  characters
Oct 26 2021,negative,the whole synopsis and casting call sounded great what a dismal disappointment soundtrack consisted of one arabic woman yodeling every time were supposed to be impressed literally every time
Oct 26 2021,positive,mark my words these films are going to be the star wars of our generation but darker more believable with superior acting stunning cinematography such incredible detail and subtle explanation to make it seem all so real   a zingy cold shower for the senses leaving you feel energised and optimistic for the future of film
Oct 26 2021,positive,there were certainly things missing from the book there always will be few changes were made but i fully supported the ones i did catch overall i felt like the film did justice to the story i left excited to see what they will do next fear is the mind killer
Oct 26 2021,positive,dune is a must the best adaptation of a classic sf novel ive seen in ages maybe ever and damned enjoyable the director and cast did a magnificent job  one can feel the weight of the events happening a galactic civilization about to be broken and remade  i cant wait for part two when the spice hits the fan
Oct 26 2021,positive,epic i was wondering how they were gong to get the whole book into one movie then figured it out with the part one
Oct 26 2021,positive,dune is the best adaptation of a classic sf novel ive seen in ages maybe ever and damned enjoyable
Oct 26 2021,positive,beautiful landscapes and production design  some of the fight scenes were not convincing at times so they could improve their fightscene executionchoreography cinematography and stunts  the ending was not satisfying at all  i know that it covers only the first half of the book but it still shouldve had an ending that was somewhat satisfying
Oct 26 2021,positive,cant wait for part 2
Oct 26 2021,positive,dune may be to scifi what the lord of the rings is for fantasy    it is finally possible to review this film  living in europe i had the chance to see him more than a month ago and once it was not enough i wanted to see him at least one more  dune is a movie to watch in theater you need the big screen to enjoy this opera  villenueve confirms that he is one of the top 5 directors in world visionary uncompromising faithful to his vision of things  however the power of this cosmic epic tale is also thanks and perhaps above all by hans zimmer who gives us yet another masterpiece soundtrack which as far as im concerned already gives him the oscar 2022 in the category  dune deserves to earn to earn a lot  we are dealing with something huge majestic which could accompany us for years finally disconnected from the detached inclusiveness and the politically correct  dune is a dark introspective slow film that takes itself seriously and is decisively good  a breath of fresh air in years that are very uninspiring in their homogeneity
Oct 26 2021,positive,closest ive come to understanding the ip
Oct 26 2021,positive,wow  i read dune a few times a long time ago  i wondered if i would now be able to follow the complex story but i had no problems as the movie set it up nicely  beautifully shot  wonderful fx  i was blown away with this movie  cant wait for part 2
Oct 26 2021,negative,sorry but i was bored with it 
Oct 26 2021,negative,its a cheap bad reboot
Oct 26 2021,negative,i thought johnny depp was going to pop up selling his colognethis was garbage
Oct 26 2021,positive,this is epical a opera film great cinematography perfect direction the best original soundtrack of the year timothée chalamet and rebecca deserve a oscar nomination
Oct 26 2021,positive,loved it loved it loved it  the scope the storytelling the acting it was all perfect  timothee chalamet is a treasure  hes easily one of the most exciting young actors to come around in a generation  its only a matter of time until this guy wins an academy award  the movie needs to be experienced in imax  loved every minute of it and cant wait for part 2  denis is a movie wizard
Oct 26 2021,positive,as a long time fan of the novels i felt this adaptation far surpasses any previous attempt yes its gorgeous and the notes from hanz zimmer crawl all over you in the best possible way however my favorite bits are the from the well cast actors i loved that rebecca was allowed to give feeling to jessica true panic over the risk to her son and sincere grief over the destiny she helped thrust upon him and the loss of her duke i loved chalamets paul and i was originally uneasy with his casting his performance during the gom jabbar was perfect as was his panic when he realized the path before him to me this was a perfect introduction to this world with its conclusion being pauls journey to understanding that his place is now with the fremen i absolutely cant wait for part 2 and to see jessica and chani both be able to dive into their characters even more and for alia to be introduced
Oct 26 2021,positive,a master tribute to herberts book
Oct 26 2021,positive,amazing visual  sounds script in a different league from the previous adaptation   cant wait for part 2
Oct 26 2021,negative,most boring movie ever
Oct 26 2021,negative,people actually paid to watch this in a movie theater
Oct 26 2021,positive,villeneuves dune part 1 is visually stunning and brilliantly scored  the action and fighting are intense without sacrificing the scenes themselves and the cast was wellchosen  i was also pleased that i wasnt inundated with voiceover thoughts  some of my favorite scenes showcased powerful acting by timothe chalamet and rebecca ferguson though the acting overall was phenomenal  this movie does the book justice
Oct 26 2021,positive,i am all giddy with excitement after watching that film in all aspects the movie soared the visuals characters dialogue shots costume design ship designs props world building sound design and score chefs kiss
Oct 26 2021,positive,this movie was legit very tough
Oct 26 2021,negative,in a word bad visually beautiful but so long slow and incredibly boring feels deliberately stretched out to allow for several sequals an incomplete bore fest actually made me appreciate the david lynch version i waited a year and beyond disappointed does anyone here think they can sit through it twice if not you need to lower your kudos and star score for this film
Oct 26 2021,positive,its a nearly perfect film imo denis villeneuve made a beautiful mesmerizing and involving movie faithful to frank herberts novel  if i had to name a weakness id say it lacks a little bit of development in 2 of the most interesting and misterios characters thufir hawat and piter de vries the mentats i hope they get some justice if theres ever a directors cut or extended version of this fantastic movie  the sound the score the vfx are simply unbelievable all elements work together to make such a fantastic piece of cinema bravo to all of them
Oct 26 2021,positive,phenomenal film 
Oct 26 2021,positive,great adaptation of the book the absolute best of the dune movies brilliant cast
Oct 26 2021,positive,great story acting cinematography overall the best movie of the year
Oct 26 2021,positive,this is exactly the scifi movie that moviegoers were waiting for dune is of course based on a book but it feels very fresh and unique a lot to unpack in 2 hours and 30 min however the beginning of this journey has me hooked cant wait for more
Oct 26 2021,positive,enjoyed this movie for those that are new to dune i would suggest to do some googling on what dune spice and the different factions are before going in might be hard to follow if you are not familiar with the terms and then you can fully enjoy this epic ride 
Oct 26 2021,positive,absolutely worth seeing i loved the world building and the setting it was compelling the whole way through the musical score only added to the stunning imagery and epicness
Oct 26 2021,positive,this is finally the movie the book deserved
Oct 26 2021,positive,it was long but they did it perfect setting up for part 2 definitely same formula and tempo as  the forest movie if lord of the rings
Oct 26 2021,positive,every complaint that i had with this movie used the word more more of a particular character story or overall if thats my biggest complaint i say job well done
Oct 26 2021,positive,some movies are really meant to be seen on a large screen  i debated whether to see it on streaming or in the theater  i chose the theater  the vastness and scope of this film will be lost a smaller screen  it is ambitious and beautiful yet still somewhat detached  it is truly epic but like the book it can be confusing and frustrating  this is the best version however we can hope for with this material  it is a difficult source to translate to the screen  timothee chalamet manages to transcend his pretty boy facade and make his paul the one to judge all others by  there are some good support from oscar isaac  and rebecca fergusson  worth seeing especially on the largest screen you can find
Oct 26 2021,negative,this is the worst movie i have ever seen in a theater the only reason i gave it a half star is because i had to in order to post my review
Oct 26 2021,positive,dune movie is probably one of the most beautiful films ive seen this year from beginning to end its an amazing scifi poem  highly recommend it
Oct 26 2021,positive,definitely a visual feast this generations dune denis villanueve is on his way to becoming as legendary as ridley scott for painting cinematic scifi masterpieces
Oct 26 2021,negative,i loved the book and its sequels and thought the directors cut of the delaurentiis version was more than passable  but there are some movies better left unremade  stilgar was definitely out of place and that mattered  paul didnt know what he did not know which was a central theme of what the book was all about    rent the old version and especially the directors cut  the intro explains how they got there and was faithful to the original
Oct 26 2021,negative,despite great actors and some nice scenery well its a desert i only realised half way into the film that i am watching a trilogy the trailer is highly misleading as it includes future visions of the protagonist consequently the film drags you through pointless tent scenes ceremonies and over extended action scenes you learn about holy trees that go up in flames a few scenes later sacred knives are gifted and disappear from the narrative it just pointlessly goes on and on i struggled not to fall asleep some of the cgi was badly done and had a star wars retro look about it at the end of this film i felt like i had watched an over extended prelude gone are the days when a film is a satisfying and whole event and not just some money making legacy there are better ways to spend an afternoon
Oct 26 2021,positive,i like the epic feeling the wonderful performances the arresting and mysterious music and the gorgeous cinematography the movie is faithful to the original book and makes what was supposed to unfilmable into the beginning of a true space opera i must watch it again in imax
Oct 26 2021,positive,though i find the oppressed vs oppressor narrative the left seems to love is bit tired and over simplistic and plays into the hand of strongman authoritarian i cant deny this movie is truly masterpiece visually beautiful and engaging and intriguing story
Oct 26 2021,positive,this movie does everything that i hoped a movie adaptation would do stay true to the source and spirit of the book some of the subplots were shortened but still gave one wonderful introduction to whats coming in the next movie this is how dune should have been filmed
Oct 26 2021,negative,the plot where was it i could barely hear the dialogue most of the time because of all the whispering when timothee would speak something else would be happening in the background making him almost inaudible  i watched the movie with 6 other people and none of them could understand what was going on the whole time dont waste your time on this movie if youre want an engaging plot if youre only watching because the advertise zendaya as apart of the movie dont she appears for 10 minutes at the end and 5 seconds throughout the movie
Oct 26 2021,negative,boring storyline i genuinely dont get the hype
Oct 26 2021,positive,one day ill tell the young ones i saw dune in the theater when it came out and they will be so jealous
Oct 26 2021,positive,good movie better than the previous version
Oct 26 2021,positive,great story with awsome actors
Oct 26 2021,positive,has to be the best scifi movie ive ever seen try to see it in imax sit in the middle  least 12 way up the sound track sets the mood throughout  the cinematography was top shelf the cast was excellent  the story kept my interest from beginning to endmy only complaint had to do with the volume of the music in a few scenes where it made the dialogue hard to hear it just may have been the theaters speakers but i wasnt the only one with this reaction i over heard couples in front of me  to my left both say what did she say  i didnt hear what he said i think what ill do is rewatch it on hbomax  use the subtitles to see what i missed not my favorite thing to do as i much prefer the big screen experience    a sequel is in order  i hope we dont have to wait too long
Oct 26 2021,positive,well worth the extremely long wait another tune fan happy
Oct 26 2021,positive,fresh take on an old story music graphics and story telling was amazing will be watching multiple times and cant wait for part two
Oct 26 2021,positive,i thought it was very well done the imagery is amazing and the acting is solid i was a bit skeptical going in but this is a solid remake they are apparently breaking it up into multiple movies which was a bit annoying having to wait for the finale but they are off to a good start
Oct 26 2021,positive,visually stunning but stilted somehow and not as engaging or as thrilling as i had hoped
Oct 26 2021,positive,lots of set up for a sequel that may or may not happen as part 1 of the first book i had a good time
Oct 26 2021,positive,a beautifully made movie very pleasing to the eye cinematographically however i always felt like i was a step behind in what was happening like in a fog when i would get tp a certain point i could work backwards in my mind as to how we got there but a film shouldnt be hard to follow at times i found it slow and baring at other times loved the action the visuals and the music overall i wouldnt see it again a valiant effort
Oct 26 2021,negative,this movie is too long too slow too emotionally self absorbed bo  ring
Oct 26 2021,positive,dune is my new favorite scifi movie of all time
Oct 26 2021,positive,it was awesome visually beautiful loved the acting anxious for dune part 2
Oct 26 2021,positive,movie was long foe no reason could barely stay up
Oct 26 2021,positive,sit back and get swept up in this experience the score the set costumes details and the start of a story that is epic   itll leave you thinking about the details afterwards thinking about the scale and depth of this vision  its already stood out as one if the top film experiences in my lifetime
Oct 26 2021,positive,dune was an aweinspiring spectacle of a film denis villeneuves vision was breathtaking to behold and the cast killed it in their performances i was simultaneously wowed by the direction and captured by the emotional narrative epic sweeping and masterfully done honestly movies like these remind me of why i love cinema
Oct 26 2021,positive,fantastic cinematography along with a beautiful score impress in this film along with its great cast and compelling story good enough to keep you grasped and waiting to see what the following movies have in store
Oct 26 2021,negative,to long staring at sand no character development no ending like watching a sand storm is interesting missed the whole point of the book first movie was better by 10 fold hard to stay awake at 4pm
Oct 26 2021,positive,it was hard to here the words they spoke the movie moved but left us hanging would like to have seen more
Oct 26 2021,positive,im not sure what i was expecting but whatever it was this movie exceeded it  to be honest i was hoping it would be better than the 1984 version which was an ok movie maybe just a bit overdone though this version is much closer to what i understood the story to be about i will confess though i have not read the book  this version was filmed in darker tones to emphasize the struggle that is beginning  i thought timothee chalamet was excellent as the young paul atreides who is beginning to realize there is something very different about him that first of all he doesnt understand what it is and secondly how to control it  overall i would highly recommend this movie it is well worth the admission id you saw the 1984 versionfuggeda about it  see this instead there is no comparison like two entirely different movies
Oct 26 2021,positive,loved it i was afraid star power would detract from it but it had to opposite affect due to some superb directing i would take this movie felt like the book i have read twice and i hope the second half gets made a truly cinematic masterpiece great job
Oct 26 2021,positive,the most amazing fantasy movie ive seen in a long time it was complicated but the culture was so immersive a perfect source of escapism hats off to everyone who created it 
Oct 26 2021,positive,loved this movie  greatest scifi moving of the last 5 years one of my new favorites  had to go give my ticket sales to see the movie in the theater
Oct 26 2021,positive,phenomenal    just a gorgeous movie  very faithful to the book
Oct 26 2021,positive,nothing disappoints except having to wait for part 2 to be made and released  the acting is superb the cinematography is gorgeous the world building is expansive and the total delivery holds up to the spirit of the books   streamed at home and now must see in 3d
Oct 26 2021,negative,this slow paced story does nothing except lead you on for future movies majority of the character growth is inconsequential and is veiled behind prophecies that will take place in future sequels see dune if you want to be on the edge of your seat for nothing happening in this specific story
Oct 26 2021,positive,the atmosphere created was out of this world and the performances were gut wrenching in a good way loved it from start to finish and cant wait for part 2
Oct 26 2021,positive,as a fan of the books i was blown away great cast visuals score and pacing it just flew do yourself a favor and watch it on the biggest available screen this is not a film to watch on your phone or laptop it is truly epic in scope if you havent read the books do yourself a favor and read a primer they do a good job of dropping in important information but if you arent paying attention you might miss it  the film ends around the point in the book where the first time break happens so dont expect a conclusion this is not a whole story arc highly recommended
Oct 26 2021,positive,one of the best science fiction stories written by frank herbert about courage how to deal with fear and betrayal is partnering with one of the best directors denis villeneuve to present dune 2021 scopes of this franchise emphasizes the importance of recognizing deception cultural differences controlling adolescent influences whilst becoming a man self control and leadership the movie put me in a hypnotic state while remember my father reading them to me for years a must watch and respect for the herbert family for entrusting denis to direct it correctly and make up for the 1980s incident
Oct 26 2021,positive,excellent movie i have my wife and my sister in law with me and they hated this this movie has very specific audience who either read the book or enjoyed the 1980s movie 
Oct 26 2021,positive,i dont think theres a more difficult set of books to adapt into a movie denis villeneuve did a remarkable job and got me hooked on dune just like i was when i first read the books years ago visually stunning and great character and plot development for a complex story cant wait for the rest of the trilogy
Oct 26 2021,positive,great start and good story second part will be well worth the wait
Oct 26 2021,positive,when i saw people saying its the next star wars or the like i was skeptical but after watching it i have to say those reports are correct i cant wait to watch it again and even bought the first book because i need something to bridge the time until the next movie comes out 
Oct 26 2021,positive,peak science fiction
Oct 26 2021,positive,great start cant wait to see more
Oct 26 2021,positive,although i had low expectations this version of dune is visually stunning has good character development and is engaging it is a long movie and in my opinion began to lumber a bit around the 2 hour markwhich is why i gave it 4 12 stars rather than 5  but then ended on a powerful note well worth watching and my favorite movie
Oct 26 2021,positive,dune is the most immersive and nuanced science fiction film ever and the best film of any genre of the past year
Oct 26 2021,positive,i have yet to read the novels but jumping into this movie blind was actually a great experience overall    the scenery and music score were both amazing in every aspect    the film overall was a bit of a slowburn but when things pick up they pick up real hard
Oct 26 2021,positive,gorgeous cinematography sets and costumes great actors some vfx didnt look finished
Oct 26 2021,positive,awesome movie  definitely similar to the board game and iconic book series the sound design really highlights the theme and scifi visuals would definitely recommend especially if youre a fan of the series   was a long movie though but seeing as it packs so much of the first book in a run time of 2 hrs 30min its understandable definitely must see
Oct 26 2021,positive,waiting for the part 2 amazing movie denis did it again
Oct 26 2021,positive,continuation was a disapointment
Oct 26 2021,positive,totally cool as good as star wars
Oct 26 2021,positive,beautiful cinematography and effects they made a few subtle changes but overall a good movie
Oct 26 2021,positive,the cliffhanger is eating my soul
Oct 26 2021,positive,my review of dune slight spoilers    weve had the movie from the 80s the tv series and of course the book of legend i think at this point the screenplay and director just assume that people have either read the book or had exposure to the dune story and concepts in some way  as a result it seems much is left unexplained andor unsaid in this movie    having read the book in every scene i can look at the characters face and know their internal dialogue when theyre not speaking the 80s version had the characters think out lout for the audience to hear whereas the 2021 version leaves it up to you to figure out i feel many scenes were an homage to stanley kubrick where he just shows you something with no explanation  creating a tone of mystery and otherworldliness in fact the way the space ships were presented seemed like they were cut right out of the 2001 deleted scenes reel     i see this movie as a supplement rather than a standalone piece as such it works very well as always denis imparts a sense of gravitas in every scene he can pull great performances out of actors like jason momoa his acting has been spotty in the past  so the directing was top notch the fx were mostly top notch and i feel like he absolutely nailed how the shields worked     other things could have used more treatment such as the large battle and the aircraft  for example its not clear why some of the huge ships had their shields taken down and were destroyed to be fair this is a character driven story so the action and scifi elements take a back seat by design    one thing that made me subtract a star was how the melee fights were presented especially the duel between paul and jamis the melee fights were a big part of the book and were described in detail in this movie they were often hard to follow   maybe zoomed in too much or bad camera angle or the frame rate or something films such as the john wick series or upgrade really raised the bar for fight scenes and i dont feel that bar was met here there was one scene where paul has a vision of being in a large battle and it was very well done maybe because it wasnt so zoomed in it was a panoramic view  and i thought why didnt they do all the fights scenes like this    the casting was on point and the acting especially jessica fergusons was a pleasure to watch timothée chalamet did a great job of showing pauls precociousness while at the same time showing vulnerability the tone of stilgar and the fremen was accurately depicted for the most part  their ruggedness and innate spiritualism the harkonnens could have easily been overdone but dennis did a good job of keeping them from being cartoonish and one dimensional the dialogue was often hard to understand  many lines were mumbled and the sound mix could have had the dialogue volume a bit louder i wonder if dennis does this intentionally for effect     while all of deniss movies have pacing issues with the exception of sicario i felt this movie did a good job of moving things along by strategically omitting certain parts of the novel  the novel dragged and was slightly repetitive at times  to be fair there were some things omitted that i felt needed more treatment  like how using the voice required the user to be around the victim for a while before it could be effective especially if the victim was strongwilled an explanation of why laser weaponry was not ubiquitous would have been useful for newbies otherwise it looks like a major plothole also a quick line about how computers were outlawedabandoned by mankind would have helped set the background     as with most high budget films the visual are stunning the dp got all the angles on the actors and conveyed genuine artistry again the fight scenes could have been done better but everything else was eye candy at times i felt like i was watching an ambient music video which is totally fine because hans zimmer did the soundtrack     making a dune movie is basically putting a giant target on your back  much like lord of the rings it has to live up to the legendary status of the novels while at the same time introducing the story to people who are totally unfamiliar with it i feel this movie succeeded at both there were certain notes that could have been hit that were not but at the same time there were aspects of the movie that outshined the novel
Oct 26 2021,positive,excellent special effects  the thopters were very well done the sandworms are impressive  some deviations from the book but true to the spirit of dune
Oct 26 2021,positive,watched it three times in imax twice and it didnt feel long at all for 25 hrs i could have gone longer in the world that denis v showed us this movie was good given the scope of the book and naturally things had to be cut this should have been done like game of thrones but given the format it was near perfect the acting was strong and while i enjoyed the soundtrack it may not be for everyone this movie is technically sound it should win multiple awards this movie may confuse alot of people because of very little back story to explain why things are the way they are especially combat i had the benefit of reading the books and watching the old movie and television mini series please make part 2 immediately
Oct 26 2021,positive,very good movie interesting story special effects are great soundtrack is outstanding fresh movie
Oct 26 2021,positive,by far my favorite scifi movie of the past decade it lived up to its hype in all aspects the visuals were beautiful and truly felt other worldly i was hooked on the story because it is so different to other futurish scifi movies out there right now its quirkiness makes it special and helps it stand alone from the rest of the genre 
Oct 26 2021,positive,a visual masterpiece denis villeneuve is in his element with this type of thematic story telling its bigger and grander than any story in a single movie i am so happy that he did not try to fit everything into one movie can not wait to see second if not third installments
Oct 26 2021,positive,dune is a visual and auditory spectacle that must be seen on the biggest screen available excellent acting and story what holds this back is being the first part of a larger story and being almost entirely setup for a supposed sequel 910 overall
Oct 26 2021,positive,good cliff hanger of course
Oct 26 2021,positive,this was an amazing film when a project this ambitious hits every goal it was aiming for youve got to just stand up and cheer for that direction acting cinematography music sound design practical and cgi effects this is a once in a lifetime movie and you owe it to yourself to see it on the biggest screen you can find with no distractions
Oct 26 2021,positive,dune was just amazing  went with my husband who is a huge fan of the books and he was blown away  i only have a passing knowledge of the material from catching bits and pieces of the original movie  i was drawn in as much as my husband and son  the casting was perfect  all of us anxiously await the next movie
Oct 26 2021,positive,i really enjoyed this movie i didnt realize it was two and a half hours long and it really felt like it ended too soon i wish theyd made it longer but i understand the limitations of movies shown in theaters    every moment of the movie really draws you in    one thing is the whispering was too lowgarbled i would have appreciated some subtitles during those scenes    im looking forward to the sequel and just want to say thanks to everyone involved in producing this film
Oct 26 2021,positive,epic world building stunning visuals and mostly good to great performances i want to love this movie but some of the jarring music choices and overall grave seriousness of the overall tone take me out of the moment a bit    the end also feels abrupt and as if it should read to be continued    i think this two and a half hour movie would have been better served as a high budget tv series it felt like we barely spent time with any characters and then then it was over    stylistically it felt like if you sucked some fun out of star wars and made it for the game of thrones or westworld audience    is it worth watching yes absolutely i will be interested in the sequel and either drop off there or be hooked
Oct 26 2021,positive,new to the mythos but has me hooked
Oct 26 2021,negative,very slow thru whole movie disappointing for the first dc movie of a new series really missed the mark on hooking you in
Oct 26 2021,negative,so boring  waste of timecould have been edited to 1 hour blank time between every piece of dialogue filled by overly serious stares and soundtrack meant to be dramatic but after the 1000th time just boring
Oct 26 2021,positive,great visuals and the mythology of the whole thing was amazing i wish the him couldve went deeper into the politics and why everything was happening but thats a minor gripe
Oct 26 2021,negative,judging by the percentages im certainly the odd person out here but i found the film a bit flat and tedious basically a marvel movie without dialogue or snarky oneliners which at least made it better than marvel movies yeah lots of cg but nothing that was more interesting than the cg that came before much better desert scapes in lawrence of arabia the one thing that stood out positively was javier bardems delivery of his lines which was quite well done and engaging but he only had five minutes of screen time so overall meh ill also be glad if we ever get back to filming realistic fight scenes instead of the perfectly choreographed fight ballet with the precision cartwheels over your nemesis found here
Oct 26 2021,positive,its really good and the best sciencefiction film since star wars
Oct 26 2021,positive,i attempted to read frank herberts novel dune when i was in the seventh grade i had begun to read more fantasy literature and was looking at older heralded novels i can still recall my frustration of reading those first five pages and having to repeatedly flip back and forth to a twentyfivepage glossary of terms so that i could even start to comprehend what was happening on the page after those five excruciating pages i gave up maybe i was too rash and maybe my older present self would be more accommodating to the struggle or maybe it just wasnt worth the effort i never watched the 1984 david lynch adaptation that was met with great derision from critics and fans alike although it does have its vocal defenders hindsight alert lynch turned down directing return of the jedi to helm dune so when acclaimed filmmaker denis villeneuve arrival blade runner 2049 became attached to direct a bigbudget largescale adaptation of herberts novel i was finally interested for the first time in my life it was originally slated to be released in 2020 and after the studio planned to release dune onto its hbo max streaming service villeneuve and the production company negotiated to make sure a theatrical release would still be an important part of the plan alas i watched the 2021 dune at home and i found myself enjoying the experience and development of the world building however its unlikely to watch this version of dune and feel like you got a full movie for your money    in the distant future like 10000 ad mankind has colonized worlds and the most important planet of them all is arrakis its a desert world inhabited by poor natives freeman who live a moisturepreserving life mining the natural spice a special substance that makes space travel capable as well as prolonging human life the top family houses are vying for dominance and house atreides has been assigned by the unseen emperor to rule over arrakis and bring it and its spice production back in line duke leto atreides oscar isaac sees great opportunity but also great danger the other houses will scheme to engineer the failure and desolation of house atreides especially house harkonnen led by the baron stellan skarsgard who is like a mixture between marlon brando from apocalypse now and marlon brando from the island of doctor moreau plus with levitation powers paul atriedes timothee chalamet is his familys heir and much is expected of him especially from his mother lady jessica rebecca ferguson who believes he may be longprophesied messiah on arrakis paul and his father must tackle this very delicate new mission while keeping the many adversaries at bay    as anticipated dune is yet another visually stunning and gorgeously immersive visual experience from one of the greatest visual filmmakers working today if you can watch the movie on a big screen or at least a bigger screen then you owe it to yourself to do so the sweeping vistas and startling science fiction imagery have so much power and grandeur to them if lynchs movie inspired a generation of devotees and impressionable children i imagine that this superior modern version will do likewise the production design and costumes are terrific and perfectly in keeping with the larger scope of the expansive visuals you really feel the size of this world and its imposing weight villeneuve has such a natural keen eye for pleasing visual compositions but he also has the patience many famous big screen stylists lack he allows the moments to linger and to let scenes breathe in a way that feels more transporting and immersive if you were simply looking for a visually resplendent moviegoing experience then dune is the ticket the sound design is also very smartly aligned and makes use of unconventional and alien sounds to make the movie feel even more like its own thing when dune came out in 1965 this was before much of the modern building blocks of our scifi popculture so in a way while dune was the influence it feels partially like an odd aftereffect rather than a predecessor the same thing happened with 2012s john carter based upon a novel a hundred years old that influenced many scifi adventure serials and now seems derivative even though it came before the many imitations i was happy with the first 90 minutes of dune and felt like the slow pace of the first hour and its heft of needed but spacedout exposition was paying off with a thrilling assault the concept of the protective shields is a smart way to communicate the casualties of battle where kill shots are illuminated in red informing the audience or a mortal wound it makes for an easy to read visual to keep up with the development of battle and stay in a safer pg13 realm the whole rescue sequence on the mining station is thrilling at every step    the cast is another major credit to the success of dune chalament little women has a soulful yearning to him to learn to be his own man to prove his father wrong and then prove worthy of his fathers faith surprisingly the next biggest role isnt zendaya malcolm and marie the woman that paul dreams about prophetically its rebecca ferguson doctor sleep as pauls mother shes a woman with deep secrets belonging to a powerful religious sect that might be the real power behind the throne lady jessica is more pauls mentor than any man she teaches him to hone and focus his mind to use the voice to impart his will and to prepare for the hardships to come with every new exposition dump and she has many we learn about her growing concern for the fate of her son and her possible culpability for that fate theres a genuine warmth between them that serves as the films emotional core i enjoyed watching jason momoa aquaman and dave bautista army of the dead as opposite ends of super good fighter guy though momoa looked unsettling without a beard needless to say the 2021 movie is far more diverse than the 1984 movie it makes space feel more lived in when its reflective of a diversity of people that we already have at this point in our history    and then after the hallway mark dune became a protracted sequence of chases and then i started to worry that things were just going to end in an unsatisfying manner relegating the 150 minutes as setup for the asyetunplanned sequel and thats exactly what happened my mood began to deflate somewhat during the last hour of dune i was still interested and the visuals were still mighty captivating but the events had the unmistakable feeling of being stretched out to meet a frustrating stopping point a pause that didnt produce a satisfying endpoint i just kept thinking oh theyre not going to resolve this and oh zendaya is barely going to be in this movie and the movie proved my predictions correct its hard to judge the movie as its own entity since its so dependent on a part two that has yet to be greenlighted though its strong opening boxoffice returns are hopeful this is an expensive movie possibly pushing 200 million so its quite a gamble to declare you would only be adapting roughly half of the story villeneuves blade runner sequel a movie i loved had a budget of 150 million and a worldwide gross that didnt make the producers comfortable going forward with a blade runner 2050 to be fair that was an original story a sequel and rather well contained still its an expensive scifi movie that has as much in common with dry art house fare as it does blockbuster adventures like villeneuves dune the promise of a second movie is not secured if dune doesnt do well enough well forever be left with a movie that feels designed to only be a teaser it reminds me of the hubris of 2007s the golden compass where the filmmakers had a whole 20minute finale that they carved out with the intention of having it be the opening for the assumed sequel welp even when designing a multimovie arc its necessary to plan each entry so that it can exist as its own beginningmiddleend and with a suitable intermediary climax the lord of the rings movies each had their own climax each moving the larger picture forward and each had storylines and subplots that came to a head by films conclusion dune doesnt there are more dead characters by the end and certain characters are displaced but it feels less like the end of the bigbudget dune movie and more like the conclusion of episode two of the dune miniseries    my resonance with the source material is minimal but the world of dune feels stuffed with stuff and not as deep in the realm of commentary fans of the book series will likely thrill at the level of minutia the 2021 movie luxuriates in allowing fans to lap up the lore for those of us uninitiated into the fandom it feels like there could be more going on behind the scenes the book was released in 1965 and has clear parallels to middle east occupations and quagmires a subject even more relevant in the first quarter of this new century theres the occupying force coming in to manage the supposedly primitive natives on a desert planet replacing the last occupier who made bold promises that were unable to be met by the reality on the ground the parallels of colonialism are there and obvious but thats because everything in dune seems obvious to me the bad guys are corpsewhite and dressed in all black they look like the alien zombies from 1998s dark city itself referencing the silent scifi classic metropolis the leader of house harkonnen is this noxious man who bathes in black goo and sucks the life force from others i dont need my scifi to be ambiguous about its heroes and villains we clearly recognize the bad guys because theyre grotesque however the lessons learned by the heroes seem a bit stilted its attacks on capitalism are a little more nuanced but not much the planet of arrakis could produce water but thats not in the interest of the power brokers of the galaxy they need the spice for the economy and thus keep the exploitative status quo the parallels are there but theres not much more to be had other than direct summations the movie has more to say with religion and messiah figures but at this point were grading on a curve and the more complex commentary attached to messiah figures seems reserved for a part two    another aspect i want to highlight that seems trivial but no less intriguing to me is how herbert chooses his character names were eight thousand years into the future spanning multiple planets with names like arrakis and giedi prime and salusa secondus and then we have such anodyne twentiethcentury names like paul and jessica its funny to me that herbert goes to the trouble of coming up with so much jargon and terminology and aliensounding names and then he says hey this guys name is duncan idaho like hes a supporting character in point break i realize this is a very dubious criticism and there are other character names to conflict with this assertion but it made me laugh at the different levels of effort herbert put into his worldbuilding and universe than selecting character names for that same far away land    after watching the new dune i went and watched the 1984 david lynch version for the first time and was quite simply dumbfounded ill credit lynch for many of the weird choices in style and how it never stoops to even be accessible for a mass audience despite having characters explicitly narrate their schemes and motivations out in the open by scene one the power play that took up 90 minutes of dune 2021 is awkwardly explained in full by the end of lynchs movie it is an incomprehensible campy mess i only have more appreciation for the 2021 dune after watching the goofy those eyebrows 1980s version that lynch has disowned entirely although that stirring guitar riff from the score still rocks thirty years later the new dune is only intended as part one as its presumptive title promises and because of this key artistic decision theres a feeling of padding and wear by the end i found myself reflecting back on the first 90 minutes more fondly its not that the last hour is absent great moments or audacious style but its hard to fully judge this dune when its last line is its own conditioning of expectations this is only the beginning the 2021 dune is a visually remarkable movie experience with fantastic artists executing at some of the highest points of their talent im eager to see if a part two can provide the satisfaction lacking in this beginning half its a hell of a start but it feels too incomplete and in need of an ending    nates grade b
Oct 26 2021,positive,legendary we need dune part ii
Oct 26 2021,positive,epic  visuals vfx score actors story worldbuilding and storytelling worth the cinema experience
Oct 26 2021,positive,a brilliant movie visually expansive and stunning beautifully haunting score and a strong and dynamic cast have watched it multiple times already
Oct 26 2021,positive,this film is a masterpiece in every aspect the cinematography the sound design the score i am literally speechless i have no idea why the second part isnt officially green lit yet
Oct 26 2021,positive,the movie visually is beautiful as for the story its deep nerdreally deep nerd i tend to think the messianic trope is a bit used up so i kinda cringe at that however a manufactured messiah is a bit interesting i wish that was focused on more all in all its good wish i saw it on the big screen could movies be getting better finally fingers crossed
Oct 26 2021,positive,after 40 years of trial and error part of a classic is brought to the screen the right way i can only hope it makes enough to justify filming the rest
Oct 26 2021,positive,great movie photography and plot are really nice and actors seems to be perfectly chosen cant wait for part two coming into theaters
Oct 26 2021,positive,amazing movie from start to finish a masterpiece
Oct 26 2021,positive,awesome cant wait for the next parts
Oct 26 2021,negative,didnt like this movie hard to follow and very repetitive seemed like all fight scenes were about the same will not be seeing part two
Oct 26 2021,positive,go see this in the biggest nicest theater you can and then see it again  movies this aweinspiring do not get released every year
Oct 26 2021,positive,great adaptation amazing film
Oct 26 2021,positive,imax is a must but you may miss some dialogue watch it a second time on hbomax with subtitles cinematography was stellar and the score and sound were great the adaptation was faithful to the tone of the book but there are some unfortunate cuts my first time back in a theater in a long while and it was the perfect movie for it
Oct 26 2021,positive,i was one of those weirdos that actually liked the 1984 david lynch version of dune its weakness though was trying to do it all in two hours when i noticed the part one in the opening title i was both saddened and relieved not to see the entire book come to life the beauty and scope of this film is stunning  kind of a dune version of avitar  you are blown away with the environment at this point in the film paul seems emotionally flat when you expect more gusto from the guy lady jessica is timid and afraid throughout most of the film that will certainly change in part 2 and i am keeping my fingers crossed this film can finish what it started
Oct 26 2021,positive,stunning overcome with emotion several times art direction cinematography  sound design soundtrack and costuming were off the charts acting was solid and the story kept pretty close to the book cant wait for part 2
Oct 26 2021,positive,there probably will never be a better adaptation of this novel than what has been done here  this cast truly catches the essence of what herberts characters are and the visuals combined with zimmers amazing score bring it home
Oct 26 2021,positive,awesome it boggles the mind to watch this movie knowing its second part isnt already greenlit
Oct 26 2021,positive,f yeah gorgeous on every level
Oct 26 2021,positive,so good  cinematography music settings castall of them were first rate  i am a fan of the books from way back and the movie was true to the source material  movie and book fans will love it
Oct 26 2021,positive,i loved the movie  it played like i read the book with emphasis on the aspects that i personally like  my girlfriend really liked it too and she has not seen the earlier movie nor read the book blaspheme i know right  my only dislike was the dreaded part 1  but i give them a pass because it is such a huge story
Oct 26 2021,positive,loved it not totally true to the books but a fantastic interpretation visually stunning and some great performances from the cast
Oct 26 2021,positive,very loyal to the book didnt go overboard with the blue eyes like a previous movie waiting for the conclusion
Oct 26 2021,positive,just a beautifully shot epic beginning to what i could see being this generations star wars i know that may sound condescending since this is such an epic famous story but it is what i can compare it to for this generation
Oct 26 2021,positive,i cant wait for the sequel
Oct 26 2021,positive,i liked it but it has too many long boring empty visuals and overdramatization to appeal to the more shallow minded but not enough character focus and stately refinement to appeal to the more cerebral of us who actually read the book and have knowledge of the characters overall it was a very good depiction and remake but the 1984 movie still had much better acting story progression and character development i know its just the first part but why is spice needed who are the navigators what is a guildsman  where the fuck is fayd  and what idiot made the decision that gurney should act like a juiced up mma fighter rather than the swordsman of nobility or knight like he was supposed to bebasically it come down to lots of plot holes missing context and knowing that patrick stewart played a much better gurney than josh
Oct 26 2021,positive,had high hopes for this remake considering the original film was one of my favorites back in the day i was totally let down as a fan of the original i had many issues with this movie first part two why do we have to wait to see the ending the original give you the whole story watch it now i feel the casting was off point as well in my opinion jason mamoa what is the point of his character his story line was a waste and useless to the story in my opinionif  you eliminated his story line the whole story could be put into one movie no part two needed  the actor that plays paul atraides is not  believable to me that he will rise up to be this great fighter and leader of an entire resistance given his small stature and lack of muscle  also why are there no cameos from the original movie sting kyle maclachlin  sean young so many opportunities for these actors in roles in this movie  the special effects were great the only area in my opinion that was done better than the original
Oct 26 2021,positive,great picture special effects were great very good movie hopefully part two is as good 
Oct 26 2021,positive,loved the moviebut assume there will be several sequential films to complete the book
Oct 26 2021,positive,cant wait to see it again visually stunning
Oct 26 2021,positive,very much enjoyed dune very nice cgi i liked the casting too mysterious movie done well needed more zendaya big time though
Oct 26 2021,positive,looking forward to part 2
Oct 26 2021,negative,too long and storyline slow
Oct 26 2021,positive,this is the besttruest adaptation of the book to date  keep in mind this movie only covers the first 12 of the first book  the script leaves out a lot of the complicated unrelatable dune language which makes it flow better      the acting is great right down to most of the extra character actors  the costumes are as realistic as one can expect for a scifi movie  the special effects and digital renderings of the ships caladan and arrakis are superb      definitely watch it in a theater first  it is huge in scale    my only complaint is the same complaint that i have for all movies at this point  the sound mix between the dialogue and the action scenes is completely infuriating  some of the dialogue is so quiet that it is difficult to hear while the action scenes are so loud that they nearly blow your eardrums out  seriously someone in hollywood needs to fix this consistent problem
Oct 26 2021,positive,as a fan of the novels who has seen the original and the reboot mini series on scifinow syfy i absolutely loved this first part definitely worth seeing in 3d
Oct 26 2021,positive,visually entertaining
Oct 26 2021,positive,this movie absorbs you into the world and builds a thrilling story
Oct 26 2021,positive,visually amazing sound and score is impressive cant wait for part 2
Oct 26 2021,positive,so good to see a movie adaptation that was almost as good as the book
Oct 26 2021,positive,awesome story first of allif you have bot read the first book already please do so the theatrics and cinematography are beautiful the  acting is spot on looking forward to part 2 and 3
Oct 26 2021,positive,i struggled to understand the movie after the 2nd time in imax
Oct 26 2021,positive,i have watched it in imax and at home on hbomax  the imax difference could not be larger  you cannot truly appreciate how massive this film is unless you see it in imax and hear it in imax    i have a state of the art home system i spent thousands on  doesnt touch the imax experience   the movie itself is very well paced and interesting throughout  it only suffers from not having a hard date for the sequel
Oct 26 2021,positive,best adaptation of the book
Oct 26 2021,positive,excellent movie more of a retelling of the 1984 movie than the original book but so well done i can definitely see myself watching this movie again cant wait for part 2
Oct 26 2021,positive,directed and acting were beautifully sets and costumes were amazing great supporting act and good action little long and some of the philosophy was hard to follow but otherwise great film
Oct 26 2021,positive,great movie it helps to have read the books
Oct 26 2021,positive,i liked it that it was science fiction and fantasy theme it was awesome plot even its just part one  i now its a book and its thick one  i wanted to show more and it ended so quickly and  now hopefully part two will come out i was edge of my seat  so cool and awesome
Oct 26 2021,negative,slow and confusing a theme
Oct 26 2021,positive,the soundtrack is insanely thrilling and fascinating all the percussive sounds and deep low rumbling noises that hans loves to use that opener is kind of ominous but also incredible omg what am i getting myself into this is exciting the sound design that zimmer created with his music and sound effects is amazing experimental and bombastic     how is the house of atriedes just going to blindly accept some mission like that without any knowledge or background of what their mission entails they have no idea what theyre getting themselves into very interesting concept with the whole wrist gadget that creates a personal force field blue meaning a hit and red meaning a death blow i really liked the subtleties during the conversation with his asian doctor and mother the way his doctor spoke to him in mandarin and warned him and then his mother doing sign language telling the doctor that this event never happened that whole scene with the old lady dressed in black robes was something else it seems paul has been handed down some sort of powers from his mother he has the gift of visions     arrakis seems to be a very religious planet resembling much of what seems like islam i love how shrouded in mystery everything is regarded to paul being a chosen one holy shit the harvester in the desert looks just like the box that paul put his hand in to test his pain threshold holy fuck man that sandworm is terrifyingly enormous it could probably swallow up moons jeez man these harkonnen are fucking ruthless damn leto went out like a straight g and duncan too holy shit fight till the last breath literally dude the technology that the harkonnen possess is terrifying the laser that can literally cut through anything is horrifyingly powerful that was incredible it was almost as if the sandworm was acknowledging paul thats so crazy how paul had to kill the one fremen member so that he could be accepted into their community he had never killed anyone before that my worry is that pauls mother vows extreme loyalty to the bene gesserit what if they use her as an inside spy to infiltrate the fremen that look that she gives at the end made me question what her motives are things are going to get really interesting in the next movie and i cannot wait     exquisitely shot every shot seems to have a purpose and each one is beautiful the imagery is incredibly epic and grand in scope and the cgi is actually impressive a lot of the artistic designs and concepts for the objects in the movie are very original and beautiful to look at already this movie is making a poignant statement on business greed land ravaging for resources and colonization i love the overall ominous tone of the soundtrack that gives off this stepping into the unknown feeling that makes it both exciting and uneasy at the same time ok denis was 100 inspired by star wars for this movie no doubt about it some of the interiors seem to be inspired by hr giger a lot of the objects in atriedes home world seem to be inspired by ancient egypt hieroglyphics and such the lighting is beautiful perfectly casted and exceptionally acted this movie is filled with a powerhouse cast of actors     beautifully epic everything looks incredible in this movie omg i cant get over it theres so much to look at from the wardrobe design to the interior design to the lighting the colors the objects the space ships the film locations the grand scope of the sets its overwhelming to say the least the lore is incredibly rich and pretty deep  fascinating all the different languages and factions all the technology or lack thereof an absolutely exciting enthralling epic that also has elements of suspense and mystery beautifully ominous imagery all throughout and of course in great villeneuve fashion the compositions of his shots are magical its themes on fear and overcoming fear charging head on into it is inspirational and motivating its been a pretty dull and stale year to say the least 2021 but this movie right here just made it all the better it gave me hope for the next the movie was incredible amazing i didnt want it to end i was immersed in the world and its characters its incredible what denis and his team were able to create just from adapting the book i mean hes basically creating a new franchise sort of speak hes paving the way for the dune universe to be expanded upon maybe a tv show or something idk maybe not lol maybe wishful thinking all i can say is i cant wait for part 2
Oct 26 2021,positive,wow it holds your attention i cant wait for part two
Oct 26 2021,positive,loved everything about it a fantastic book successfully made into a fantastic movie thank you
Oct 26 2021,negative,not that this will count like many other nonverified reviews some how its passed rt by that verified audience could obviously be knobbled to provide positive reviews     well another film that proves you cant polish a turd i watched the 1980s dune and didnt like the story but thought i would give this a go due to the reviews stating it was faithful to the book the cinematography and special effects are typically high class villneuve once again does a good job there must be a studio exec who causes this book to be filmed it is a completely ridiculous story same as the 1980s on the upside the high quality cast and shooting do mean that it is quite funny when  something ridiculous cheesy or clichéd happens
Oct 25 2021,neutral,it was slow moving and took along time to end i read all the books and saw the very first movie back in the 80s  some movie can not be do over
Oct 25 2021,positive,as someone who has read the book im very pleased with the adaptation looking forward to part 2
Oct 25 2021,positive,incredible cinematography acting and story everything is soo good must watch for everyone starwars meets game of thrones you just cant go wrong
Oct 25 2021,positive,beautiful piece of visual art
Oct 25 2021,positive,great movie but very disappointed the sequel hasnt even been started and a wait for over a year is messed up some changes from the original but smartly done
Oct 25 2021,positive,liked it more than i expected to  it is pretty and well done  it sticks closely to the book which i find to be just ok and makes it the movies greatest downfall  it is way better than the 80s movie
Oct 25 2021,positive,cinematic for sure however so confusing from the start overpowered by glaring ominous music that most times was way too much for the scene
Oct 25 2021,positive,absolutely breathtaking
Oct 25 2021,positive,i am a fan of the 80s version of dune there are dozens of us but this movie is everything that movie shouldve been i thoroughly enjoy it great special effects goo acting and the epic feel was there i hope they greenlight part 2 soon
Oct 25 2021,positive,best sf movie ive seen in years yeah its paced more slowly and yes it only covers the first half of the book but this is an intelligent spectacular film that sets a very high standard for all other films not just other sf films
Oct 25 2021,positive,amazing visuals but some scenes were very forced overall 810
Oct 25 2021,positive,this film is a stunning adaptation of the first half of the novel the visuals acting and score are incredible i thought it was wellpaced and built tension effectively i didnt feel like this movie was two and a half hours long at all and cant wait to see part two
Oct 25 2021,positive,the mouse was cute and the worm were cool cinematography was cool music was bomb worm riding looks super awesome cgi was incredible all hail hans zimmer
Oct 25 2021,positive,i loved that it was pretty intense and it was just a overall super good movie also its cool to know that there is a part 2

Oct 25 2021,positive,amazingly good  adaptation of a very long complicated novel
Oct 25 2021,negative,it was so hard to follow and i fell asleep
Oct 25 2021,positive,in the hands of another director this movie could seem like a bland set up to another movie but everything looks gorgeous and desolate that in the end i was happy to take the journey
Oct 25 2021,positive,for fans of the book  this was a masterpiece  so good
Oct 25 2021,positive,the movie deserves a better review than this but ive got a new alltime favorite
Oct 25 2021,positive,works very hard to stay close to the source material and does a good job   everything is top quality    because ive read the book paired with the fact that they stayed so close the source material made it very predictable  but still very enjoyable to watch    despite the directors claim streaming viewing was great
Oct 25 2021,positive,love the movie cant wait for part 2
Oct 25 2021,positive,amazing cast and beautiful cinematography dune is one of the most faithful book adaptations i have ever seen hollywood needs to make movies like this
Oct 25 2021,positive,аааааа это оргазм мозга ктоине согласен со мной идите в  i saw the first dune when i was 13 or 14 didnt get it at all just another scifi movie then it was dune 2 rts then books and now its that masterpiece its like i rerun in time  back to childhood when you are learning new universe making first steps in the imagination of the world that is what new dune means to me
Oct 25 2021,positive,wow loved it i cant wait until the sequel hurry
Oct 25 2021,positive,one of the most impressive movie experiences ive had the pleasure of in a long time albeit pretty long dune is an experience only possible on a big screen only a theater could provide
Oct 25 2021,positive,great movie  sticks to the book  great acting visuals and sound  only downside is it was only part 1 of the 1st book and part 2 is not filming yet  it would be a real shame if part 2 and maybe subsequent books in the serious too did not get made
Oct 25 2021,positive,i loved this version of dune its exactly how i wouldve imagined a remake would be some elements were changed but they all fit i cant wait for part 2 
Oct 25 2021,positive,one of my favorite books of all time brought to life once again i had high expectations for this movie and they exceeded them the cast was perfect especially timothy and rebecca my only complaint is that part 2 hasnt been filmed yet
Oct 25 2021,positive,soooo good  see it in imax or somewhere with really good sound 
Oct 25 2021,positive,this is exactly how i pictured dune in the hands of a filmmaker like villeneuve   i absolutely adored this film the characters cast acting action worldbuilding and the visuals villeneuves style of filmmaking was tailormade for dune
Oct 25 2021,positive,amazing cinematography amazing acting a little slow paced honestly reminded me of lotr fotr because of that definitely different which i loved waiting for the sequel to be made
Oct 25 2021,positive,great movie based on an even greater book
Oct 25 2021,positive,pretty slow hopefully they step in ip in part 2
Oct 25 2021,positive,i never read the books or watched the old movie so i came into this movie blind dune was less actionpacked than i though it was so i got a little bored but this movie is still good the characters were good and the acting was good so overall good movie and pretty excited for the second movie
Oct 25 2021,positive,fantastic and beautiful movie ive seen many call it slow paced but i think it fit this movie beautifully it gripped me from beginning to end scifi at its finest
Oct 25 2021,positive,a truly masterpiece the incredible acting of all the cast cinematography direction of villeneuve and mind blowing special effects and music the incredible adaptation for a really complex book from frank herbert is phenomenal for much one of the best movies of the year and on the scifi gender
Oct 25 2021,positive,loved it  exceed my already high expectations  best movie ive seen since dunkirk
Oct 25 2021,positive,easily the weirdest movie ive ever seen dune blew me away the score the cinematography the acting the plot all brought together a unique experience that surpassed my high expectations yes the movie does a lot to set up the sequel but it still is so enthralling and intriguing that i did not feel very irritated by that even the acting was very good dune was simply fantastic but certainly relies on a sequel   9410
Oct 25 2021,positive,an amazing spectacle that needs to be seen in cinema
Oct 25 2021,positive,i really enjoyed the movie the visuals and sound track were awesome dune is an incredibly hard book to adapt for a movie format but this film succeeded i can not wait for part two
Oct 25 2021,positive,i loved the movie  a little long but who cares  i can sit thru a 234 hour movie no problem   unlike the guy  who  sat next to me at  the movie theater  and for the last hour of  dune he was looking  at his damn iwatch every 5 to 10 mins and making a sound like he was irritated the movie was not ending  anyways dune was awesome  i had a blast  when i got home  i had dinner then turn on hbo max and watched it again

Oct 25 2021,positive,thank you for a great movie  cant wait for the sequel  though the bagpipe music during the battle was a little too much  i have watched it 3 times so far  better than the 80s version by far
Oct 25 2021,positive,well written shot and acted
Oct 25 2021,positive,i  everything about denis villeneuves resuscitation rendition of this classic  dune i read the novel in high school during the 1980s after seeing the original movie i say that it makes up for my disappointment when i was a teenager lol everyone within and outside house atreides delivered an outstanding performance timothe chalamet oscar isaac rebecca ferguson  jason momoa killed all of them did so proud of them hans zimmers score is stellar and pairs so well a triumph in spite of the pandemic and musiciansvocalists had to create new ways to make this score what it is props to them kudos to all that made this 1965 novel come to life ive been anticipating and hyping it on sm like tumblr fb  ig since summer 2020 they say good things come to those who wait this was exceptional and worth the push backs reshoots etc    whenever it can come to fruition i and my bestie look forward to d u n e part two fingers crossed
Oct 25 2021,positive,not perfect it has been years since i read the book  my only real complaint was they really neglected dr yueh they really didnt capture the betrayal and invasion as well as i thought they could have  i realize there are time constants and i probably could have sat there another 60 minutes even if they got no further into the story than they did
Oct 25 2021,positive,i could have kept going into part 2 very captivating i loved it
Oct 25 2021,positive,very well done loved the soundtrack visually beautiful cant wait for part 2

Oct 25 2021,positive,great detail was given to the book two and a half hours and it flew by a couple of changes were noticeable but didnt affect the story line hopefully it will not take 5 years for part 2  3
Oct 25 2021,neutral,ridiculously overpraised if you havent read the books the film provides next to no context or lore information which is a serious problem to make matters worse not much actually happened which worsened the pacing and the ending was an unsatisfying cliffhanger for the next film the plot was predictable and can be summarised as three events the home planet all hell breaks loose on a visit to another planet and the main character and his mum have to traverse a desert it was literally that simple in 2 hours 35 minutes which probably wasnt long enough to get through the contents of the book properly there was some action but it was generally unimpressive with some of it being overreliant on explosions the combat was largely silly due to armour that turned out to be pointless and some fake looking choreography eg the final fight the characters werent bad but they desperately needed more development again there was barely any information on the doctor who the emperor was who the fat man was who the witch lady was and so on there was however some funny and appropriate dialogue although not much dialogue overall similarly the cast was solid the acting was mostly spot on the cinematography was beautiful the visual effects were excellent in many cases eg aside from several scenes like this full cgi scene of fighting with a mugshot of the main character appearing as a visor was lifted the setspropscostumes were high quality and the soundtrack was decent besides too many moany screams its such a shame that a technically well executed film was once again let down by poor writing
Oct 25 2021,positive,loved it it really is one of the best if not the best adaptations of dune it really must be seen in an imax theater
Oct 25 2021,positive,a true cinematic masterpiece and a huge accomplishment for the sciencefiction genre dune is a film that deserves to be seen in the theaters
Oct 25 2021,positive,awesome especially seeing it on the big screen   so loud but thats what makes it an event
Oct 25 2021,positive,excellent adaptation from the book focusing on the most prominent themes such as pauls growth and his mothers tenacity good special effects especially when the combatants wore the shields
Oct 25 2021,negative,too long to get to any purpose  just as bad as the first one
Oct 25 2021,positive,i didnt go into this movie with high hopes after reading some other reviews it was a very entertaining watch from start to the end its a very interesting fantasy movie with good action story and characters that you like definitely a good movie to pass the time in the afternoon and i look forward to the sequel
Oct 25 2021,positive,dune part 1 is a great start to a very large 6 book saga while i understand there are some slow moments in this film the impressive suspense and action help make up for it this is only the beginning and theres so much story to tell so lets hope the suits at warner bros continue this grand adventure this is lord of of rings meets star wars ill definitely watch this again in theaters soon
Oct 25 2021,positive,a very faithful adaptation of the book i loved it
Oct 25 2021,positive,beautiful photography and inspiring characters
Oct 25 2021,neutral,rarely have i left a movie immediately thinking a directors cut was in order  here i do and not to simply add length its long already but to recut and fill in key missing content and context  for example other than two quick lines we learn virtually nothing of the properties and power of the spice that make it so critical to life and travel in this empire  similarly we are told very little about the emperor and why he would want to play these great houses off one another in such an elaborate trap  this and other major gaps leave the great characters in endless action sequences lacking context or gravity  if a person has not read the books or seen the prior movies good luck finding much deep meaning in the current cut villeneuves version  that said the bones are there to make this into a great film
Oct 25 2021,positive,no spoiler review    denis villeneuve has struck gold again with his latest directorial outing of dune or dune part one as it is displayed in the opening of the film be warned this is not a complete story but instead sets the groundwork for a fingerscrossed part two even those that have read the 56 year old source material by frank herbert will likely take enjoyment in what is at the end of the day a quality piece of cinema as with blade runner 2049 also directed by villeneuve the film has some of the finest production design visual effects score and acting talent one could hope for unlike blade runner 2049 however the story is presented in a more approachable style where blade runner 2049 was very abstract and misleading in its plot dune adheres to a more straightforward approach dune accomplishes this by leaving out a lot of the complexities of the politics involved that are described in the novel this is something that may put off book purists but it does serve a purpose in keeping the pacing of the film from stagnating everything is boiled down to its most basic component for the sake of moving the plot along at 2 hours 35 minutes this helps move the audience through the first two hours quickly and only slows a bit in the final thirtyfive minutes as you approach the end    with paul atreides we get another superb performance out of timothée chalamet he gives a far more relatable performance as paul and his slow descent into destiny as the story unfolds is handled in a uniquely muted style not seen previously with the character the supporting cast could occupy a review of its own so i will say that all but two cast members turn in excellent performances the only two that were lacking for me were sharon duncanbrewster as dr liet kynes and chen chang as dr wellington yueh in the case of chen chang i dont really blame the actor as the character was the one given the least service by the script regarding sharon duncanbrewster she simply did not have the gravitas to play the role of dr liet kynes both small nitpicks as the performances were not terrible they were just the two weakest links in a very strong chain    although this film is available to watch at home on hbo max it is most definitely a movie theater experience i saw it in imax and i urge anyone that has access to one to see the film in that type of theater the cinematography is beautiful and truly takes advantage of the screen size when scenes shot for the imax are presented throughout the sound is palpable and envelops the audience but occasionally the dialogue is lost behind the action or the strong eclectic score by hans zimmer  as a film i would give this a 9 out of 10 or an a and leave it at that of course i cannot resist making a book comparison and pining for my favorite chaptersmaterial that did not make it into this film so as a book reader i would give it a b as a friend of mine said in the theater this aint no marvel film so when the credits roll the movie is in fact over with nothing else to see
Oct 25 2021,positive,this film is an absolute masterpiece and scifi epic it delivered me the greatest and most immersive theatrical experience of my life i have no complaints about any aspect of this movie this is a must see in imax
Oct 25 2021,positive,outstanding visuals outstanding acting and how they incorporated the story line i know some people will be lost but please read either the book or watch the 1984 film for reference enjoy
Oct 25 2021,positive,finally the vision and scope of dune fulfilled on the big screen thank you dv
Oct 25 2021,positive,if youre going into dune thinking you can stare at your phone for most of the movie or that its easily digestable  please dont go anywhere just put down your phone and pay attention trust me its worth the payoff    this adaptation fits more in than the original by far still think it should be a game of thrones style mini series but definitely an excellent film well worth the watch and wait for part 2
Oct 25 2021,positive,best movie ive seen this year and in quite a while great acting directing and story 
Oct 25 2021,neutral,so first off i am not a fan of the original  this one i had high hopes but was left feeling like the story dragged and got bored  found myself checking to see how much time i had left  some of the character development was good but again 2 12 hours  too long
Oct 25 2021,positive,the spice must flow  so on the dangerous planet of arrakis the most valuable commodity in the universe is harvested spice  there is to be a changing of houses for who is in control of the planet shifting from harkonnen to the atreides  this is about the son in house atreides timothée chalamet figuring out what his role is in all of this as he had been having visions of arrakis even before he got there  now im a bigtime david lynch fan so of course i have seen the 1984 version  i could never truly follow what the movie was all about since it is mostly unintelligible without the aid of a roadmap but i was nevertheless excited to see what beloved director denis villeneuve could do with the material  the trailers looked stunning and i dont think there will be too many disappointed people who looked forward to this  now since ive seen the lynch film the thing i was most worried about was how difficult this was going to be to follow  this is presented in such a fashion that you dont need a glossary of terms to understand what is going on  yes this is hard science fiction but they make it digestible  they tackle exposition without making it feel like exposition and that is the magic trick that makes it all work  also the cinematography in this is dropdead gorgeous which has long been a staple of villeneuves library  even if the story isnt grabbing you youre going to be wowed by the eye candy at the very least  i opted to watch this on hbo max because i wanted to view it in the morning since it has a long runtime but i think you will get more out of it if you see it on the big screen  also even though this is two and a half hours long it isnt a struggle to get through  yes i took my fair share of bathroom breaks but i always wanted to pick it right back up without my attention or focus wavering  i love the entire cast in this and it seemed like everybody was handpicked with foresight in mind  its an ensemble piece as well and i dont think anybody upstages to steal the show  i dont even think you need to be a scifi junkie to appreciate this  this is basically star wars with a denser mythology less comedic relief and a healthy dash of lawrence of arabia  the story is surprisingly accessible now that it has been handled correctly  my only real problem is the same issue that i have with infinity war youre only getting half a story here  theres a part two in the pipeline and im looking forward to it  the deck seemed stacked against dune for financial success so i sincerely hope we dont end up with a halffinished story since this is not exactly a cheap movie to finance  this more than met my expectations and you should definitely check it out
Oct 25 2021,positive,pretty well sticks to the book  very entertaining great soundtrack a visual treat especially in imax
Oct 25 2021,positive,a great scifi movie a triumph its a thinking mans scifi movie great cast another great movie by denis villeneuve love the performances love the soundtrack if you like the newer movies that that hollywood is producing the brainless action with no concepts right now then this is not the droid youre looking for can not wait for part 2 3 years just my humbled opinion
Oct 25 2021,negative,did not like it at all hollywood has this stereo typical interpretation that in 10191 ad we will have mega wars why cant they make a movie people are having a healthy competition over who have make the most peaceful and joyful planet mega wars extremely boring and dry landscapes a savior from a family etc so many cliches total waste of time
Oct 25 2021,positive,very good and well done  if youre a big fan of detailed stories and dramas this is for you  if you like cheap blockbusters this is not for you
Oct 25 2021,positive,naturally a lot is left out since the source material is several hundred pages long but its a much more faithful to herberts narrative and vision than previous adaptations while still managing to be a compelling film in its own right i also like the fact that its a slower paced film rather than a brainless roller coaster ride that the average blockbuster has become my one complaint is how the music is purely atmospheric i wouldve liked the dune universe to have its own memorable theme like star wars or game of thrones
Oct 25 2021,positive,excellent on many levels a bit more lead in of the story in the beginning on the key players and more character depth upfront would help its a lot to compact in 25hrs but excellent on the the work accomplished perhaps a directors cut after the spice settles definitely looking forward to part 2
Oct 25 2021,negative,one of the most boring films i have ever seen well made it had me on the edge of my seat waiting for nothing to happen
Oct 25 2021,positive,quite alright honestly has potential to become big
Oct 25 2021,positive,i was blown away while not being a true dune saga followeri have always been fascinated by the dune universe this was a most excellent movie the effects took it over the top for me the story was of utmost prioritynot the actors who all did great jobs by way
Oct 25 2021,positive,the best movie in the past decade holy shit stop reading this and go watch it if you havent already if you have go watch it again right now
Oct 25 2021,positive,the latest film adaptation of dune is an incomplete slowburn story that definitely felt like it was done by a fan of the books with enough goodwill from previous movies to be allowed creative control unlike poor david lynch the worldbuilding is immersive the performances from the large ensemble cast are great the soundtrack kicks ass the narrative is compelling the sound mixing is downright phenomenal and the cinematography certainly knew how to keep my attention it does have a desaturated look that can be jarring for a space opera especially if your first denis villeneuve film was the gorgeouslooking blade runner 2049 but i thought it was a good conscious decision dunes not meant to be star wars and it didnt feel as pretentious as the sound mixing in tenet simply because it worked for nolan in interstellar at least unlike solo i can actually tell whos who and understand what the hell is going on and while dune isnt an action movie the action that is there is wellchoreographed and intense especially during an attack when the shields are lowered by the traitor whom just like that floating fat man the baron i will not tell you who it is at least the shields dont have the awkward blocky look of the 1984 film that unintentionally reminds you this is an 80s movie as for costume designits not worthy of mockery but im surprised at the lack of swab test memes given the tubes up the noses of paul his mother and the fremen oh and also theres no annoying inner monologue like the 84 film everything can be understood perfectly within the context of the film even in scenes without dialogue all in all dune is a slowburn adaptation of an iconic piece of scifi literature that definitely feels like a love letter to the book that makes me hopeful that the movie will make enough money for villeneuve to be able to continue the story in a part 2 just remember that its more game of thrones in space than it is lord of the rings in space in other words more focused on political intrigue than it is on epic battles even if it does still have its share of action just a word of advice is all for your expectations sake  the five stars stay because i knew in advance this movie was meant to be a twoparter even though the marketing omitted that fact save for the tagline it begins
Oct 25 2021,positive,the pitfall of epics like these are that the world and lore become so dense that it becomes hard to understand i didnt feel that with this movie and that is a great accomplishment i thought the story was very engaging and the 25 hours flew by for me the visuals were spectacular and this is movie that you definitely benefit from seeing in imax it was a feat of filmmaking and storytelling to make a world feel so dense and full of lore yet still understandable
Oct 25 2021,positive,epic in scale this latest version of dune stays closest to the novel  baron harkonnen is truly frightening while an overwhelming sense of awe and wonder mixed with danger from the music score constantly assaults your senses  welcome to arrakis
Oct 25 2021,positive,george lucas has credited akira kurasawas hidden fortress as a major influence on the star wars franchise  it clearly was however not nearly as a large an influence as frank herberts dune novels  the trouble is making a film adaptation of this complex novel in the post star wars post david lynch dune world is a  formidable task denis villeneuve did a marvelous job bringing this to life  it is brilliant and as visually stunning as i could have ever imagined the acting and direction are both top tier  the storytelling is masterful as this is a hard story to tell and follow and yet he does it here without losing a thing  timothy chamelet is paul and he embodied the spirit with grace and charisma  the entire cast is incredible  this one sucked me in from moment 1  it is hard to believe that this is a stand alone rather than made in whole and released in parts  i cant wait for more  i hope it lives up to the ground work laid in this opening installment  i want to read the novels again  i think you can approach this with no prior relationship to the films or written work and  enjoy it  the trap is dont think you are watching a star wars knock off  this is what started it all
Oct 25 2021,positive,a must see scifi cinematic experience director denis villeneuve gives realism to this world of dune
Oct 25 2021,positive,this film is visually a masterpiece you can feel the mysticism in science fiction the story grabs you and leaves you wanting more
Oct 25 2021,positive,so good definitely worth the watch
Oct 25 2021,positive,fantastic in every way
Oct 25 2021,positive,dune was incredible even those who do not know the story will be able to follow non stop action in the middle an amazing watch for any scifi  action fan
Oct 25 2021,positive,so relieved this movie lived up to its hype everything from the cast to the soundtrack sound editing special effects are exactly what this movie required to do the book justice saw on hbo but i think i will see it again in theaters to really get the full effect
Oct 25 2021,negative,hard to watch for many reasons not only was the script written as if a teenager wrote it the acting suffered greatly because of it i kept watching in pain hoping for acting and scene improvement there was non dont believe the ratings here a few actors held there own ferguson isaac brolin and skarsgard and the rest just not a good fit here at all especially with the horrific script flavor when you watch the original dune many times over for most of us which was a testament to a timeless filming script and acting even sting held his own then hope with cgi and better filming techniques new actors this version could come close it falls miles short skip it and even watching on hbo max was hard to swallow what is worse there is a part 2 arrgghh
Oct 25 2021,positive,a masterpiece the best movie of 2021 not just a movie but an experience that needs to be felt on the big screen  this is the most epic retelling of the books that has ever graced the movies better than all the other versions of the movie combinedthey barely used cgi effects the movie feels so real and larger than life i am just so impressed
Oct 25 2021,positive,i read the book way back in school and from what i can remember this film really captures the atmosphere right  it is epic in scale which can mean it runs fairly slow but stick with it as it builds up to a dramatic ending although it really just leaves you wanting more so i hope part 2 gets greenlit  the actors all do a great job although i agree with others who have said that rebecca fergusons character feels a little undercooked showing too much weakness when in fact her character is really powerful  all in all a great scifi up there with the best
Oct 25 2021,positive,absolutely fantastic movie the new star wars i hope this continues for years its just so massive
Oct 25 2021,positive,this film is even better than most of the critics acknowledge the slow steady pacing of an ingenious plot the aweinspiring score and visuals the impeccable acting especially from rebecca ferguson and the archetypal themes embedded within a myth that speaks to us universally makes this is one of the best films in the past four decades im grateful to be reminded that motion pictures have the power of restoring within us the will to keep living and fighting we are all paul
Oct 25 2021,positive,111322  45  still delivered what i wanted from a fantasy  i look forward to the next installment  this time i wanted to share about the fremens primitive fighting  challenge rituals  to have the character be almost savage in their violence  frustration was a good touch  it was on hbo      102521  45  a well made take on the excellent novel  it reminded me of an hbo series and i am still skeptical of the main actor and whether hell be able to deliver on the sequel  i enjoyed the movie and was entertained  i was glad that it was not too violent and was something i felt appropriate for teens  it was on hbo
Oct 25 2021,positive,way better than the original dunes sometimes i couldnt make out what characters were saying so more subtitles would have been nice waiting for the rest of the series 
Oct 25 2021,positive,im not a big scifi buff so a bit hard for me to follow at times
Oct 25 2021,negative,the movie should focus on telling story not everything else
Oct 25 2021,positive,as expected dune is more than a movie its an experience visually and audibly the greatest film ever created story and acting are perfection unquestionably the best film of 2021
Oct 25 2021,positive,great movie they tried to keep as much as they could from the book beautiful world building and a great cast
Oct 25 2021,positive,bag pipes for house atreides   they are of greek descent missing characters and liberites with the story line  otherwise great movie
Oct 25 2021,positive,im glad the movie didnt cover the whole first book one of the finest book adaptations ive seen
Oct 25 2021,positive,great cast n good visual effects a hard story to put on screen but good job overall
Oct 25 2021,positive,loved it visually stunning great action sequences loved jason mamoas part and timothy s did a wonderful job as the lead really hoping for a sequel only gripe is that cliffhanger ending with no promise of a sequel
Oct 25 2021,positive,absolutely loved it saw dune 2021 in an imax 143 screen and felt completely immersed in the story really looking forward to part 2
Oct 25 2021,negative,25hrs of my life i wont get back  a deserted storyline with a deserted script deserted on a reputation wasted and left to be admired by operatic lonely planet readers who thinks the scenery was beautiful  the movie left me thirsty for a sequal which id dread to watch but feel i need to to grasp where the journey was trying to get to
Oct 25 2021,positive,omg its so good  i should have waited to see it on imax but then hbo is right there on the tv     pros    beautiful the visualizations of the worlds is better than i had hoped for  its just gorgeous to watch  im going to go see it again on imax for this reason alone   easy to understand  dune is a complicated story with lots of complex dynamics but the filmmakers managed to walk the tightrope of giving you enough to understand what was happening without overloading   a ton of fun  lots of action drama and fun moments to keep you entertained    cons   long runtime  it is worth the ride but the film is long which can be a challenge for those with busy lives or short attention spans   not enough of some characters  i know these contradict but i would have loved to see more with some of the best and well acted characters  no spoilers here  just saying that the baron was amazing when he was on the screen    just found out that part 2 was not already in production  uh man if they dont make the second one that will just be horrible  
Oct 25 2021,positive,excellent sci fi  enormous good translationstory  well shot directed and produced
Oct 25 2021,positive,the movie was true to the book and has lots of action but the blowing sand obscured what was happening during quite a bit of the movie had i not read the books and knew the plot i would have been questioning what was happening overall i thought that it was a good interpretation of the book
Oct 25 2021,positive,terrific movie a real work of art cant wait for the second part
Oct 25 2021,positive,one of the most visually impressive movies youll ever see and the lore of the world  the performances of the cast will have you enthralled with the story absolute mustsee on the biggest screen you can find
Oct 25 2021,positive,dune was visually stunning wellacted and wellwritten and lacking in plot advancement  which may have been intentional the desert landscape is reminiscent of the mandalorian but this film has a much darker tone than the show it reminded me a bit of game of thrones in outer space storywise and that i can get behind go see dune you wont regret it you may be left wondering what just happened but this is a well put together motion picture
Oct 25 2021,positive,i read dune before watching because i wanted to know the source that inspired the film this was a fun experience watching the story unfold on the big screen the visuals the sounds the costumes my only complaint as a reader is where the story pauses on film cant wait to see the continuation
Oct 25 2021,positive,the visual and setlocation effects were awesome the biblical parallels as referencing a savior of the fremen who were oppressed and lands ravished for spice mining basically good vs evil a war for righteousness i never thought any future scifi movie could impress me more than star wars now im so looking forward to part two
Oct 25 2021,positive,amazing faithful to the book great for people unfamiliar with the book as well beautiful acting and cast magical worldbuilding 1010
Oct 25 2021,positive,great setting characters soundtrackhans zimmer always delivering plot action scenes twistes a must watch movie
Oct 25 2021,negative,visually stunning great special effects but unless you are a huge fan of dune already you will be lost to what is really happening as a result this movie moves at the rate of watching paint dry
Oct 25 2021,positive,i love this movie so much ive seen it twice it has amazing visuals it has fantastic acting i dont know if people who arent familiar with the book dune will enjoy it as much as i do on the negative side i think there is some very clunky dialogue in a few places and the music is too loud at points
Oct 25 2021,positive,the movie dune captured the story in the book very well the settings and cinematography were excellent the story characters special effects and portrayal of different worlds kept me engaged the entire time i loved this movie
Oct 25 2021,positive,let me start by saying i am an avid and frequent reader particularly in the scifi genre but for some strange reason despite my interest i kept putting the dune books off a big part of it was all of the rumors of them finally doing a film version the right way and really wanting something i could go into fresh not knowing much about at all i never watched the movie from the 80s and im so glad i waited this movie not only met but exceeded my expectations visually stunning a phenomenal cast and the mythology was everything i hoped it would be give us part 2 asap
Oct 25 2021,positive,compelling but somewhat slow paced the characters are intriguing but lack initial development that you usually get in movies less action than i was expecting if you have read the book you will be more engaged from the outset a series movie for sure
Oct 25 2021,positive,nailed it  brought the written lines of the novel to life and the visual world of the universe   brian and frank herberts and kevin j andersons extensive writing will one day make a scifi cinematic universe to compare to all others  as they have influenced the very foundations  hopefully this will be the one 
Oct 25 2021,positive,great movie i am a fan of dune but my husband is not a scifi fan we both enjoyed it more than any movie we have seen in a long time its true to the book but does not dwell on some of the parts that would be clunky in the movie cant wait for part 2 
Oct 25 2021,negative,for as visually appealing as the setpieces and design happen to be the story is that boring and sluggish 
Oct 25 2021,positive,dune is amazing its a slowbuild film that captivates us with small plot points until it takes us to the big deal and from there until the end were at the edge of our chair great emphasis on performances for the direction of dennis villeneuve and the soundtrack by hans zimmer always wonderful 8510
Oct 25 2021,positive,simply a masterpiece
Oct 25 2021,positive,star wars for big boys
Oct 25 2021,positive,i cant wait  for part 2 
Oct 25 2021,positive,it was amazing in every way a sensational overload
Oct 25 2021,positive,a bit too long but overall fills the need for grownup scifi drama bereft of crossovers  tie ins and spin offs
Oct 25 2021,positive,i really enjoyed the movie  i saw it in imax and then came home and watched it later that night on hbo max   the feel of the movie was realistic   they better put out the part 2
Oct 25 2021,positive,dune has amazing visuals but seems to take a very long time to trudge toward nowhere in particular there are no real emotional highs or lows just a long methodical plodding into the sand the worms look cool though so theres that
Oct 25 2021,positive,watching blade runner arrival and scario made me fall in love with his movies absolutely breath taking
Oct 25 2021,positive,the best movie aim a long time screenplay acting special effects costumedesign music directing and cinematography were all amazing and top notch they spared no expense on creativity
Oct 25 2021,neutral,as a fan of the books this movie disappoints the movie had good visual effects but the story telling was sub par the  main actor seemed to be a rehash of anikin sky walker or kylo rent from star wars a disgruntled preteen with anger issues chani was in the movie all of 5min his prescient dreams do not match the reality the interplanetary politics is vastly under explained gurney had no lute no backstory for the sadukar the harkonins  were a joke no space guild prescience or explanation  i would have loved to love this movie but honestly i can not recommend it so disappointing
Oct 25 2021,positive,while the movie itself has a slower pace the story is everything i hoped for and i enjoyed seeing this at the theater
Oct 25 2021,positive,incredible cinematography clunky storyline 
Oct 25 2021,positive,this is a very good movie and you should see it especially if youre a dune fan but   im constantly wishing  villeneuve wouldve exercised some self control and tightened up this movie just a bit i understand it needs to be somewhat dreamy and ethereal but lingering over the art shots can become tedious fortunately for us his self indulgence doesnt ruin the pace of the movie as it did in blade runner 2049 what we get is a beautiful and faithful adaptation of a portion of the dune novel as a fan of the book though i was left wanting just a bit more exploration of some of the key figures of the story such as the emperor and the guild without which were left to wonder about the motivations of many of the main characters   in the end  villeneuve delivers what we asked for a faithful epic even if it leaves us wanting more
Oct 25 2021,positive,the bestlooking movie with an amazing score that i have ever seen hope that part 2 gets confirmed
Oct 25 2021,positive,a feast for the senses direction cinematography casting and acting is top notch   the end is kind of abrupt and and half an hour could give a better tie in as some choices in the scenario   personally i could watch another two hours it was amazing
Oct 25 2021,positive,teaser trailer  the movie  the first half of the movie is good the slight nod to the early dune games and the world building is good the second half is unnecessary  its filled with teasers for the next movie which as of now isnt even greenlit  paul has no personality or substance the only thing he has are visions of him getting a character ark    the movie ends with the hero protagonist fighting and winning against the villain  antagonist  im kidding paul just kills some random guy and the movie ends
Oct 25 2021,positive,if youre a fan of frank herberts work and denis villeneuve then youll adore the adaptation it is an artistic representation of the book that took intelligent choices to remain consistent onscreen the unfortunate truth is that the movie is not an explosive blockbuster with nonstop actions and insane stunts with quirky one liner dialogue it has depth a lot of layers and quiet moments and thats something that i love about dune
Oct 25 2021,positive,watched not knowing anything about the previous movies or book and thought it was an intriguing intro im here to stay
Oct 25 2021,positive,incredibly well done but somehow not moving that said bring on part 2
Oct 25 2021,negative,well shot but boring fast cut fight scenes dull
Oct 25 2021,positive,the nearly 40 yr old consensus that dune was unfilmable is disproven in authoritative fashion dunes intimidating runtime feels surprisingly short even on a second viewing due in large part to the scope and scale of cinematographyvfx used to craft dunes expansive backdrop theres simply no way to appreciate all the detail on the first run through trailers dont do the scale of this movie justice and will only provide some idea of how this film all but demands that it be seen in a theater equally convincing of the theater experience are the aggressive sound design and film score praise and attention should be heaped on here come awards season for what is accomplished in aiding the creation of dunes foreign yet tangible environment from the shocking use of the voice to the guttural feeling of beating ornithopter wings this is one of the rare cases where sound ambushes rather than just transports the viewer character development in a narrative so expansive is the only place die hard fans could claim dune suffers at all skarsgards baron harkonnen will need to dominate the sequel to begin to do this character justice or elaborate on his role in the overall plot it should be noted that this lone issue is only due to the necessity of hitting so many necessary plot points while almost entirely excluding the novels generous use of inner monologue a challenge i am hope im not alone in seeing villeneuve tackle headon dancing on this tightrope of pace and detail then is surely the reason for the relentless tempo of the film which offers no room to breathe past the first act make no mistake though dune is far from frantic viewers who were unfamiliar with the novels had no problem following villeneuves storytelling in both of my viewings conversely those familiar with the books appreciated how this nearly pitch perfect adaptation remains faithful to the source material in almost every way this is where villeneuve deserves the most praise in pleasing both of these crowds as an example fans of the novels might catch a quick glimpse of gurneys baliset next to his bed as he wakes for battle while those new to the story wont suffer through any lengthy instrumentals during fremen coffee service directorial choices like this will leave both groups wanting more of this world and its characters and are ultimately why dune deserves all the accolades its receiving in pleasing both crowds 
Oct 25 2021,positive,i havent watched the original since i was little nor have i read the books but it was interesting at just how much dune inspired other hollywood movies it moves a little slow at the start for building up everything the only thing i didnt like was that it ended and i wanted it to keep going
Oct 25 2021,positive,it was a great show felt like right into the film can hardly wait for the sequel
Oct 25 2021,positive,the visual effects are of course stunning and i even liked the soundtrack which ive heard complaints about but the acting and characterisation are just both dull and boring not a single time do we feel any sense of humanity from the characters here i didnt once see anyone crack a smile more make a joke just constant frowning and pofaced introspection for the entire movie it led me to not care at all about any of these lifeless characters and acting by numbers actors gone are the days of fun bits of improv and method acting this is just crap ego pieces following the rules to the letter and looking like lifeless automatons with it it desperately needs some comic relief but sadly none is to be found if you enjoy scifi youll probably like the visuals which do take you on an enjoyable journey its just a shame we have to listen to all the boring people talking in it
Oct 25 2021,positive,i was aware that some people thought this movie was slow and boring and i am glad to say it is anything but that so many events and tragedies happen in this huge worldbuilding epic that i might have to read the book before part 2 comes out due to sheer excitement and anticipation
Oct 25 2021,positive,excellent  cant wait to see part ii
Oct 25 2021,negative,one of the worst movies ive seen in years this made the dune original a great movie dont waste your money just horrible
Oct 25 2021,positive,definitely did not live up to the hype had a few good moments but did not suck you in as something of this scale should
Oct 25 2021,positive,the cinematography was outstanding the build was very suspenseful you never knew what was going to happen next the ambiguity of timothees character was played very well great cast
Oct 25 2021,negative,i really wanted to love this movie  and the visuals and music absolutely deliver the problem is everything else we get beautiful sweeping vistas then dialog that is clipped hard to hear and barely develops the plot or characters the acting is only tolerable most of the time and the character and story development is really rough bad pacing and only abbreviated dialog leaves most characters feeling very 2d and generic you barely feel anything for them  add to that the gender and race swapping that had nothing to do with the plot along with some of the sexismracist comments by actors outside the studio and it doesnt help at all
Oct 25 2021,negative,sorry but this was emotionally very weak the visuals were stunning no complaints there but the story aaahhh i felt so detached i didnt become truly engaged until the last 20 minutes if i had not seen the lynch version and the syfy channel version i would be even more lost the emperor is such huge part of the story line and yet he is mia for the entire movie i dont even understand the emperors motives why would he feel threatened by house atreides the weakest of the great houses they only have 2 blood members for crying out loud and theyre the most peaceful servants of the emperor where was the threat i couldnt connect here i understand you cant include every single word of the novel but the driving motives of the essential characters that cant be removed
Oct 25 2021,positive,must see in cinemas material     this is a great adaptation thats not afraid to take its time in order to be faithful to the epic created by frank herbert    villeneuve shines with great cinematography impressive sound with all the performers delivering in droves and hans zimmer doing an outstanding work with the score stepping away a bit from his usual bag of harmonic tricks
Oct 25 2021,negative,well it looked good its new looks like we made it in 2021 decent choice of actors characters    aside from surround sound effects you get over 2 hours of nothing a real bad plot not much story  power ranger fighting not a whole lot of action or lore to keep a young audience intrigued theyl prolly get on there phones or leave the living room 40 mins in    movie was a big let down super slow pace and super boring after 2 and a half hours im still wondering wtf is dune aside from the few things water spice harkonens    it was an honestly bad movie in my opinion  you either are happy with the visuals and costume or what you get or youre not because there was no depth to any part of this film or much at all
Oct 25 2021,neutral,this movie had so much potential i liked the initial story i kept getting star wars vibes with the mc being the one and the sands like tatooine but it had so many details and moving parts that it felt messy and convoluted i really did enjoy the score hans zimmer the family dynamic and the awesome futuristic technology it would have been a hit if they would have condensed this into one solid movie rather than two that are stretched out
Oct 25 2021,positive,i was actually surprised this film was actually brilliant no agendas just a really good film
Oct 25 2021,positive,every scene is detailed and beautiful the cinematography in this film is amazing the acting and the feel of this movie is great it really makes you feel like youre apart of dune or arakis
Oct 25 2021,positive,great adaptation of the novel by frank herbert villeneuve uses his artistic eye and vision and makes justice to this epic story sometimes has a slow pace and the action scenes could be more detailed to gain more traction on main publicbut nevertheless a big achievement eager to see part ii
Oct 25 2021,positive,great adaptation not perfect but very well done looking forward to seeing it again in theaters before it leaves the cinemas
Oct 25 2021,positive,saw bladerunner by the same directory a couple of months ago dune is even more visually stunning it also greatly improves in pacing compared to his past work its a great film
Oct 25 2021,negative,i thought it was a wase of good actors cheap knock off of star wars no wonder i never saw the original
Oct 25 2021,positive,i felt the visuals were stunning the attempt to put the complex story onto film was also well done the movie puts the groundwork for part 2 into place nicely well done to all
Oct 25 2021,negative,it was half a movie
Oct 25 2021,negative,too drab director chose to do without much color   all i remember is the movie was brown  lol
Oct 25 2021,positive,visually stunning beautifully crafted on every level from costumes to set design through a mesmerizing score yet its lacking a more ballsy direction to make it a true masterpiece villeneuve camera work is too shy and not often truly inspired but the result is still greater than most movies you actually get and manages to make comprehensible some dense material sadly feels like the first act of something greater hope we will get to see the rest
Oct 25 2021,positive,well  i saw the movie a couple of weeks ago in germany but in the english original all in all dune is one of the best films i have seen in a long time but it is obviously not perfect i miss a couple of explanatory scenes i see as very important such as the banquet scene but that is complaining on a very very high level i recommend all people to visit the movie it is worth it
Oct 25 2021,positive,dune totally delivers incredible in scale  visuals and score are amazing totally brings the book to life  acting is great and fits for the serious tone this story portrays hits all the marks for hardcore scifi fans to love  a true cinematic experience unlike anything seen before
Oct 25 2021,negative,i was hoping for something different since theres so much to pull from but  its almost shot for shot the original movie  the 2000s mini series is so much better extremely disappointed
Oct 25 2021,positive,the best immersive movie ive seen since interstellar though better best execution of a scifi film since the matrix trilogy though a more storytelling approach  i was invested in each character from start to finish  for this movie to be as slow as it was i was very glued in and completely lost in the story exceeding expectations the storytelling style of this movie was executed flawlessly i walked away wanting more and more this movie was so satisfying finally an fantastical action scifi film with great visuals that focused more on storytelling and character building i mean this director has done a fantastic job ill be craving more movies from them in the future i hope other directors and writers take notealso great acting from each character flawless the sound design was incredible i have no complaints cant wait until part 2
Oct 25 2021,positive,great direction production design editing and acting  story is moving and the special effects are innovative and fresh
Oct 25 2021,positive,one of the best movies i have seen in a long time it makes me want to read the books and i am definitely not a reader
Oct 25 2021,positive,that was a masterpiece i went in basically blind only on word of mouth from book readers and the strength of dennis villeneuves resume and i was blown away that was basically a religious experience i had in the cinema the filmmaking of this movie was out for this world every shot was gorgeous the definition of every frame a painting hans zimmer outdid himself with the score epic operatic emotional it was phoenomenal
Oct 25 2021,positive,i was pleasantly surprised to see a great book adaptation dune movie goes far and beyond when it comes to adapting the complicated original piece with explaining the universe to new viewers
Oct 25 2021,positive,an incredible adaptation of the novel which until now seemed impossible to faithfully recreate some may complain of its exposition or worldbuildinginformation density but thats what keeps it so faithful to the book its similar to how inception had to keep explaining the rules of their dreamhacking to the audience every fifteen minutes but a bit less obnoxious dune part one is a true epic and assuming part two is as expertly and faithfully executed it will be a legendary film icon along side of star wars and lord of the rings thank you denis villeneuve and team for yet another wonderful film experience
Oct 25 2021,positive,not enough action to maintain some viewers attention and the plot does drag at times but overall a good adaptation of the book better than the 1984 version with sting in it necessarily spends a lot of time world building and developing the characters my teenaged kids had a hard time following the plot but i didnt have any problem since i already knew the story
Oct 25 2021,positive,fantastic movie we need part 2
Oct 25 2021,positive,beautifully made intense and inthrawling it was all the way around a great movie
Oct 25 2021,negative,cheap overall everything looked like forced acting sound tracks too loud cheap trick to make cup for remedial cinematography too long closeups overdone got the feeling actors resented script or directing overall an artistic void
Oct 25 2021,positive,a stunning visceral masterpiece that doesnt hold back on any account each scene has been transported from the pages of herberts novel and given largerthanlife grandeur villeneuve and his cast love dune and that love has meant a world of difference to this film
Oct 25 2021,positive,i loved everything about this movie the casting was perfect the cinematography was amazing i loved everything except the fact that the next one is not even approved yet
Oct 25 2021,positive,there are three kinds of dune fans  those who have only seen the movies those who have read the books and seen the movies and dune fans who have read the book and not seen the movies    i have read the series a few times now and am rereading it now currently into book 5  heretics of dune i absolutely love literary dune i love the depth breadth and scope of what is by all accounts an epic easily as complex as lord of the rings and other major epics    much of what became the original star wars trilogy was stolen directly from the previously published dune but one only needs to call it homage or influence to avoid issues    i had first attempted to read dune when i was 15 and failed spectacularly it was so hard to get into and unlike anything i had ever read before    then in 1984 david lynchs movie dune released and 16yearold me went to see it i was entranced by the film i loved the visuals the battle scenes the mystery pretty much everything that film made me go back to the books and this time i voraciously read them all the way through i was captivated    now i still enjoy david lynchs dune and i realize this is a controversial stance when i take out the dvd and rewatch it as i do sometimes adult me recognizes a film that is a wonderful mess it is a film that clearly collapsed under the weight of the source material but is still dragged across the finish line    the music is not bad but suffers occasionally from that early 80s tendency to throw in heavy pop rock and metal flourishes that bind it so securely to its era there is so much internal dialogue thoughts presented that the viewer rapidly gets lost in the ridiculousness it sting in a leather diaper  need i say more    visually though the original film is still wonderful and i believe worth watching but i understand and agree with most of the detractors    fast forward 7 years from lynchs dune and you get a new film from talented canadian director denis villeneuve who has already given us fantastic scifi in blade runner 2049 and arrival    this dune is not your fathers dune as they say    everywhere lynch went with excess villeneuve choses understatement where lynch overwhelms the view with too much talk with all the internal dialogue layered on top of the regular dialogue villeneuve pares back lynch was likely responding to the breadth and depth of the source material doing his best to cram as much explanatory dialogue in as he can villeneuve seems to recognizes where this is futile and essentially seems to say     the viewer will have to connect the dots    this is a wise choice if the director has laid out the dots in a way that they can be connected thankfully i believe villeneuve does this    visually the film is immense and grand on the scale of cecil b demilles the 10 commandments the grand scale of this universe dwarfs the characters making humanity seem insignificant in the face of nature and geopolitics the brilliant presentation of starships and various other scifi vehicles is unlike any other scifi film you will ever seethis contrast will play out well and draw out the necessary awe as the narrative continues in part 2    speaking of part 2 it should be noted that this film is very intentionally titled dune part 1 like the fellowship of the ring dune part 1 will make no sense without the followup the film ends with the words this is only the beginning and you know that villeneuve has essentially created a great and wondrous prologue for the feast that is hopefully to come    the best phrase i can use to describe dune part 1 is less is more which i realize may not make sense when you think about the adjectives i have used to describe the film immense epic enormous etc but i hold to this while the visuals music and the stage are truly majestic the choices in dialogue and action are intentionally spare almost zenlike the choices in the film line up with the source material in this way we have very small human characters caught up in a universe spanning maelstrom and to fight against such a storm would be futile so villeneuve does not fight it  he moves with it and allows it to carry him the film and audience along    dune part 1 is successful in its adherence to the source material to the point that what may be perceived as flaws in the source material little humour and where humour exists exceptionally dry one might say desertlike humour those flaws come through in the film    the acting is also fantastic the performances of rebecca ferguson stellan skarsgard and timothee chalamet are standouts to be sure brief appearances by charlotte rampling and benjamin clementine are also standouts speaking of clementine this is his first acting role and he is absolutely wonderful he is definitely a talent to watch    dune part 1 is a fantastic film if you have never read the books you will come away wanting to in order to fill in some gaps if you go to the film expecting a standalone scifi spectacle like star wars you will be disappointed this is a film for those committed to a saga    i was captivated and find it hard to imagine anyone doing a better job taking what has been called an unfilmable book and translating it to the screen btw  you should definitely see it in a theatre    
Oct 25 2021,positive,outstanding best cinema since the pandemic
Oct 25 2021,positive,best cinematic experience of my life the scale and sense of wonder is overwhelmingeverything from space ships to costumes represents the best that the movies have to offer to top it all off its a gripping story as well
Oct 25 2021,positive,this was pretty fantastic only one real divergence from the book and i get why with no adverse material effect on the story  i really hope it does well as dune could  should be as big as the marvel universe given the breadth of frank herberts fantastic universe building and the amazing arc of the dune universe extremely well done and visually stunning great for fans of the books and newbies alike
Oct 25 2021,positive,an aptly named scifisandals recommended for the viewing as to avoid sands getting in your boots
Oct 25 2021,positive,the movie was relatively slow but it needed to be to explain the in depth storyline as it supposed to be based on a series of novels set back in the 60s i think one needs to be patient because if this series continues on film it will become something big 
Oct 25 2021,positive,the heros journey deconstructed with an ever present sense of dread
Oct 25 2021,positive,it was true to the book superb acting casting and visually stunning
Oct 25 2021,positive,on the plus side  it was nice to see a different futuristic space film not related to star warsstar trek etc  on imax its uncomfortably loud visually great not keen on the hans zimmer score  screenplay  i think they could have squeezed the whole book into 2 and half hours by deleting all the slow motion bits  enjoyed it but it was a bit long
Oct 25 2021,positive,thought it was good cant wait for part 2
Oct 25 2021,positive,i saw the movie in rpx format problems hearing dialogue very important in this film with complicated story details sound effects frequently were unnecessary seemed there just to use the rpx system so loud
Oct 25 2021,positive,this movie was great it had me captured from the beginning all the way to the end  cannot wait for part 2 to come out
Oct 25 2021,positive,dune what a romp hits too close to home for me if you liked mcconaugheys 2008s fools gold then youll love this lil tim kills it shoot they all did lots of sand i got thirsty my only complaint was not enough of aqua mans butt cheeks uncut version 
Oct 25 2021,negative,i dont understand why everyone is giving it such great reviews this movie was sooooo slow and boring i watched it at home on hbo max and the only reason i managed to make it through the whole thing was because i had my phone to play on the previews made it look like there was gonna be so much action well if you saw any action in the previews that was basically it most boring movie ive seen in a long time if theres a part 2 to this i definitely wont be watching it i watched it on my big screen with surround sound the sound was the only good part of it only reason im giving it a full star and not half 
Oct 25 2021,positive,i thought it was a good update from the original movie
Oct 25 2021,positive,a refreshing reboot of the series that stays true to the source material
Oct 25 2021,positive,this was everything and more that i was hoping for  a sprawling epic that takes its time to tell in the theater i was holding my breath or on the edge of my seat for pretty much the entire film cant wait for part ii
Oct 25 2021,positive,a must to see in theaters
Oct 25 2021,positive,this version of dune is an immersive journey into the frank herbert novel the film doesnt have everything thats in the book but stays faithful to the source material it also doesnt explain the expansive backstory of everything which will help viewers new to dune to avoid being overwhelmed it definitely leaves you excited for the next part which should be even more amazing
Oct 25 2021,positive,closer to the book than the original version and a much better telling imo  definitely worth the watch
Oct 25 2021,positive,beautifully shot engrossing and thrilling this film transports you to another world that you will not want to leave see it in dolby or at least imax i cant wait for part two 
Oct 25 2021,positive,wonderful adaptation we sure hope part 2 gets approved
Oct 25 2021,positive,great pace amazing visuals and deep characters looking forward to the sequel
Oct 25 2021,positive,brilliant in every single way 
Oct 25 2021,positive,it started a little slow and loud  and then the plot of the movie came together and it was a great movie  cant wait to see the next segment
Oct 25 2021,positive,the movie kept you on the edge of your seat it was a balanced movie of action and drama i enjoyed the writing of the movie and also enjoyed that the writers displayed a beautiful bond between the son and his parents
Oct 25 2021,positive,as a film soundtrack enthusiast id like to point out that although hans score was very reminiscent of his work on xmen dark phoenix at times it certainly felt otherworldly and accentuated the scenes perfectly that said this movie is appealing in every way and hopefully will represent a watershed moment in making of blockbuster movies this 2021 film proves comedy isnt essential to the basic filmmaking formula hold my attention congrats on the achievement
Oct 25 2021,neutral,they told the story welljust wish it had concludedthe ending was underwhelmingfelt abrupt
Oct 25 2021,positive,i love the book and this movie was so well done to reflect that story the casting acting effects everything were phenomenal only con was its a fairly dark colored movie so with 3d glasses i had a harder time seeing the movie im 49 so younger eyes may have helped  i noticed the screen was lighter when i removed the 3d glasses but then it was blurry of course
Oct 25 2021,positive,the scale of dune was incredible the visuals and audio have to be experienced in cinemas my seat was shaking when the bass of zimmers score hit the one and only drawback of this movie is that it doesnt tell the whole story those going into it not realising it is just part one might be left a bit disappointed having invested 25hrs into only half of the story however villeneuve did a fantastic job of adapting the first thirdhalf of the story but again go and see this in the cinema if its safe for you to do so this film was not made for home viewing
Oct 25 2021,positive,its a scifi masterpiece like the book
Oct 25 2021,positive,at first i heard all kinds of bad reviews but to be honest this was a rather good movie  cast were great too  i also liked how they ended it  dune is a large story and needs alot of screen time  there is alot to explain or the readerviewer will get lost if they dont know  i think how they added this in was great
Oct 25 2021,positive,villeneuve delivers a thrilling scifi epic following house atreides after the emperor demands they take control of the dangerous and contested spice planet arrakis chalamet is a natural lead and shows a wide range but stellan skarsgards portrayal of baron harkonnen is particularly menacing the direction and score are equally great but the movie ends on more of an intermission than a climax i understand wanting to leave your audience wanting more but this is taking it a bit far
Oct 25 2021,positive,the cinematography was wonderful  but they wasted time on unnecessary scenes that added nothing to the plot so in 25 hours they only got through half the story incredible disappointing the next segment should be free
Oct 25 2021,positive,excellent movie best weve seen in a long time excellent storytelling even if youre not familiar with the book cinematography acting pace special effects soundtrack costumes  everything was astounding bravo to everyone involved in this brilliant movie thank you thank you thank you
Oct 25 2021,positive,felt like the book come to life is it slow and plodding at times yes and so is the book and so is life it felt quite real and powerful my only complaint is that i dont think it was marketed as a two parter and so that was a bit of a surprise although theyd probably need nearly 6 hours in order to adequately bring that book to life cast performance 10 of 10
Oct 25 2021,positive,this movie lives up to the hype its grand its breathtaking and its unforgettable
Oct 25 2021,positive,some have complained that this movie is too slow of a burn but that is dune not a swashbuckling space opera with quirky aliens but a psychological treatment of religion politics and humanity thats set among the stars and villeneuves vision of the classic tale is captivating    ill admit my biggest concern before watching the film was the casting of jason momoa who seemed a bad fit for duncan idaho but was actually fantastic in the role timothee chalamet oscar isaac and zendaya in what little we see of her also deliver riveting characters and the directors gender swap of liet kynes was a stroke of genius as sharon duncanbrewster gives the character a depth that defies her screen time    the one failing in part 1 is the portrayal of lady jessica who comes across as shallow and overly frail for someone with the power and fortitude to have rebelled against her order and successfully navigated the politics surrounding her hopefully the script and direction for part 2 will give her fewer tears and more strength
Oct 25 2021,positive,dune is a theater experience you need to have  the sheer scope of this film is absolutely massive and unlike anything i can compare it to  it has been a day since i have seen the the movie and i am still digesting what i saw  this was by far the best theatrical experience ive had in many years denis villeneuve pulled off by far his best film to date as a director and its easy to see why this was delayed as covid would have ruined its theatrical experience for most     the cinematography acting storytelling and accuracy related to the original books is absolutely sublime i brought along my husband who has not read the books and checked that the film did a great job making this easy to follow and accessible to everyone to their credit for someone who has read the books they did not overexplain just gave enough that if you were paying attention and did not read the books you would have a good idea of the concepts    dune is the best film ive seen in a very long time so yes go and see this movie i promise youll want to thank me for the recommendation
Oct 25 2021,positive,this film will immerse you in the dune world both visually and emotionally the erie music and sound effects are done to perfection fantastic movie
Oct 25 2021,positive,this is the dune movie the fans deserve it was worth the wait
Oct 25 2021,positive,amazing adaptation visually stunning
Oct 25 2021,positive,they filmed the unfilmable  truly magnificent and riveting  the extra work that went into bringing these characters and monsters to life paid off 110
Oct 25 2021,positive,should really only be seen in imax
Oct 25 2021,positive,long and boring not a whole lot of action like i was expecting and storyline was extremely dull some of the acting and casting choices was a little off too
Oct 25 2021,positive,we want to see part 2 now  this will be epic  loved it  must see it does start out a little slow its a slow burn story that builds  just stay with it because once you get through all the talk and background info that explains the story it really picks up to an amazing action packed adventure  its a beautiful movie lots of action not like anything that weve seen before  very different worlds  wow was all i could say at the end  movies are back  go see this on the big screen its the only way to see it  please make part 2
Oct 25 2021,negative,it felt like it had enough content to fill an hour pilot episode but stretched to 2 12 hours after it was over i thought thats it i feel like barely anything happened
Oct 25 2021,positive,loved it definitely not something to miss
Oct 25 2021,negative,i thought it was slow i fell asleep it needed  more action
Oct 25 2021,positive,best adaptation of a sifi book in 30 years  goes to prove sifi is about understanding the human condition and not just space wars and lightsabers
Oct 25 2021,positive,as a longtime dune fan i couldnt wait when it was announced nearly a decade ago then came the trailer and i felt myself preparing for the hype and possible letdown as dune is notorious for being hard to adapt for the big screen the lynch version flopped and the series was relatively good as possible as the low budget let it be    finally i was able to see it and it was glorious they left out certain scenes making the development of a couple of characters lacking dr yueh for example but in the grander scheme of the movie it didnt matter as much there were multiple stories to tell and it did it well i am most certainly going to watch it again and buy it when it comes out    my main gripe is that this isnt the day and age for movies such as these it lacks utter wokeness and other politics and it doesnt forcefeed the story its nuances and action the way most movies do nowadays its a slowburn of a movie and i fear most people will dislike it because of that    for me this is the best movie ive seen in a long time and if you like a good story that really stays with you as you try to see all the intricacies in it this is for you if you want a movie all about gunslinging this isnt for you
Oct 25 2021,positive,told only half the story
Oct 25 2021,positive,for fans of the book this is a welcome adaptation of frank herberts novel  for a universe as complex as herberts splitting the book into two movies was really the only way to do it justice  even if you have not read the book you can still follow most of the plot lines and the fast paced action keeps you entertained and wanting more right up until the end
Oct 25 2021,negative,like any poorly done blockbuster it is nothing but loud bass sounds over voices you will never hear or understand unless subtitles are on the scifi mini series in 2000s outshines this by miles the suspense scenes were not at all suspenseful it felt like a poorly directed high school play with cgi took all day to watch because i kept getting more entertained watching the birds outside that the movie itself shoot i have been more entertained watching the fireplace videos that this dross
Oct 25 2021,positive,this movie is a window into a fantastic universe of scifi and fantasy  unfortunately its a rather small window and how much i can really enjoy this really depends on the sequel getting green lit
Oct 25 2021,positive,this was an absolutely fantastic movie both me and my teen daughter were glued to our seats i love how theyve split the movie into two parts this is part 1 since there is so much content i would highly recommend the acting was superb
Oct 25 2021,positive,gorgeous hypnotic imagery maintains focus attention and excitement during the long exposition which is most of this first chapter the visual aspect of this movie is totally fresh and unique from the last three decades of cgi special effects in what feels like a short time the characters are well developed and understood however it would have been wonderful if villeneuve had taken scorseses route in the irishman and completed the story in one 34 hour movie its an epic tale and deserved to be treatedviewed as such
Oct 25 2021,positive,the musical score was awesome   unlike the original movie you could follow along in this version and understand exactly what was going on   there was not one dull moment in the whole movie and i was thoroughly entertained  i will admit i was very skeptical going into this movie and left 100 satisfied
Oct 25 2021,positive,go see this in the best theater you can find dolby cinema sound was incredible images astounding story was fantastic acting superb ill be going again
Oct 25 2021,positive,beautiful work of art looking forward to the second film
Oct 25 2021,positive,a beautiful cinematic experience  the pacing was a bit slow at times but the music score was outstanding  this remake has taken the original to a new level and done justice to a scifi classic
Oct 25 2021,positive,dune has finally been cracked after david lynchs curious adaptation it didnt look hopeful despite the fact that dune has been the root of many great scifi franchises and films  im looking at you george lucas  it just didnt seem to work warner bros themselves coined dune as being unfilmable  that is until denis villeneuve decided to take it on    i can imagine that for secondary audiences this will become one of those films where part way through you entirely lose track of the plot however youre kept in a trance by the alluring cinematography and glamorous special effects and timothée chalamet although theres much to unpack and a substantial amount of thinking required dune does not disappoint    dune begins with an earsplitting voiceover with it coming our first glance of zendaya as chani a member of the fremen we arrive on the planet caladan home of house atreides and birthplace of paul atreides timothée chalamet a prodigy with contiued visions of his future his father leto atreides oscar isaac is tasked with ruling arrakis a planet rich in a mysterious substance known as spice capable of extending human life the preceding rulers of the planet house harkonnens arent happy about this and will do anything they can to make house atreides time on arrakis as miserable as possible    not only does dune feature a spectacular main cast but we also see some familiar faces in the supporting cast rebecca ferguson is jessica atreides wife of leto atreides a dominant woman ready to put anything on the line to aid her son jason momoa and josh brolin are duncan idaho and gurney halleck respectively both powerful warriors and close friends of house atreides house harkonnens consists of stellan skarsgård dave bautista and david dastmalchian all of whom sport frightening bald heads    although dune does rely rather heavily on visual effects theyre done terrifically aided by remarkable cinematography get to the cinema now you wont want to miss this
Oct 25 2021,positive,visually stunning with some great performances the story is a bit heavy but its nice to be spoon fed garbage worth a watch
Oct 25 2021,positive,this is a solid version of the book with some great acting in it   the special effects and cgi werent overwhelming and did not take away from the story  the last half hour of the movie felt like it dragged out a bit and i wish they would have compressed that and taken the movie further than they did
Oct 25 2021,positive,i wish i knew it was a part 1 as i felt let down by the lack of conclusion aside from that it would be 5star film for me
Oct 25 2021,positive,i didnt read the book so i went into this expecting it to stand on its own i pretty much understood the story but as the title frame states its part i dune is genuinely spectacular the wonder of its cgi is that it doesnt like a fantasy version of our world it looks like the real version of an imaginary one its interspersed with scenes shot in remote corners of the world that have rough spectacular landscapes for a great effect the villains are numerous and villainous the good guys are virtuous regular space cowboys    chalamet is not a convincing hero playing it more as a bewildered boy who doesnt really want to join the family business its hard to see him rising to heroism like i said its part i so he didnt have to zendayas talent seems to be always appearing adolescent regardless of age lucky for both of these unfortunately cast persons the other roles are strong particularly the supporting good guys     i expect ill skip part ii and subsequent the bad guys already won once and they want it back you know where this is going future installments will require valor and leadership from the leads and these two dont project that for me
Oct 25 2021,neutral,after reading so many positive reviews i thought i had seen a different movie ive read dune twice and the sequels once so i have a good understanding of the story and the characters but the movie did nothing to convey either  it seems that villeneuve decided to substitute special effects for plot and character development the cgi is pretty good however the script needs more substance to tie it all together the characters do not have established personalities to show motivation for the things they do nor do they have believable reactions to the things going on around them  walking out of the theatre i overheard several people saying that it was a couple of hours of special effects with no plot i agree
Oct 25 2021,positive,one of the best films ive ever seen amazing sfx excellent pacingediting superb sound good acting holds true to novel  this is all i ask for in a film it was fun to watch
Oct 25 2021,positive,amazing most of it couldnt be better
Oct 25 2021,positive,i am a fan of the 1984 release version  that said this version will make it i hope if only to see the next 2 parts  the cast seems to be well selected for the known actors the new ones i am on the fence  this movie got slow in a couple of places however the storm scene and the mechanical dragon fly was probably the greatest at least for me  its a shame that the movies profitability was undercut by releasing it to hbo the same day as the big screen release  i have always gone to the theater to view a film and then decide whether to supplement it by purchasing a disk or recording   streaming imho is ruining the movie industry  i await part 2  bjs
Oct 25 2021,positive,underwhelming  mumbling and poor story telling deprive the viewer of a great story  great effects just turn up the lights
Oct 25 2021,positive,this was the dune movie treatment that the original novel deserved
Oct 25 2021,positive,great movie must watch
Oct 25 2021,positive,good visuals key casting good job
Oct 25 2021,positive,it was just beautifully done
Oct 25 2021,positive,having read the book decades ago it took a while for me to warm up to this film however  i did find it to be a good representation of the world frank herbert created  anyone who has not read the books however may be lost this violates the cardinal rule that says see the movie then read the book  read first in this instance
Oct 25 2021,positive,choreography was pretty awesome and i like the journey of the whole deserted prince finding his way back to become a leader only thing i would say is that i personally didnt give out the reactions that some might expected to get because at some scenes of the movie i would get like an adrenaline to want more action but it went from violence to just plain calm in surroundings
Oct 25 2021,positive,amazing film obviously fantastic cinematography devastating score and a perfectly evolving plot
Oct 25 2021,positive,dune was definitely worth watching in the theater it was such a great adaptation the acting and action sequences were excellent and it renewed my respect for jessica  i read the book about 2 decades ago but i was still able to follow the plot easily
Oct 25 2021,positive,let me put it this way not a single person left the movie at any point to run to the bathroom there was no idle chatter or futzing on phones everyone was transfixed for the entire two and a half hours dune is beautifully done and teleports you to another world having been a long time fan of the book and having seen the lynch movie and syfy series its clear that this is head and shoulders beyond what was done before my disappointments with things dropped from the story largely because they cant translate easily into the medium were minor and the cast really was perfect for their roles i strongly recommend seeing it in the theater on the big screen the spectacle deserves it
Oct 25 2021,positive,the special effects as well as the fine acting and story make it a superb movie
Oct 25 2021,positive,the scale and visual spectacle alone make this dune a must see add in a well adapted screen play and strong acting from the entire cast and you end up with the most exciting scifi franchise launch in a long long time one of the films greatest achievements is the thoroughness of its world building on par with the lotr trilogy its almost as if the pieces of the book that did not make it onto the screen are still happening just outside of frame what prevents me from going all in on this dune is that i felt there were pacing issues that a lesser emphasis on the imagery would have allowed more time to fully form dunes complex political and social systems as well those house atreides itself and therefore given us more connection to its down fall ultimately this is successfully papered over by chalamets captivating acting which never misses a beat and carries our attention ever deeper into the the world of villeneuves dune however this still leaves us with a dune in which the focus is so fully on paul that we wish we could see more of the world just out of frame
Oct 25 2021,positive,loved it so much i ordered the books because i cant wait for part 2
Oct 25 2021,positive,it really captures the feeling of the book great soundmixing and score cool tech overall great experience
Oct 25 2021,positive,i think to vindicate the film there needs to be a sequel so much of the length is packed with rising action we dont get a true climax but a false peak that shows us where the real one may lie hoping dune 2 doesnt take 5 years to make
Oct 25 2021,positive,the attention to detail is awesome and every major important point was ticked off in a way that told the deeper story and still made good cinema for me this rates up there with the translation of lotr from book to big screen a difficult task for simple stories and a huge accomplishment for for a story as complex as dune well done
Oct 25 2021,positive,by far the best adaptation of the source material so far well acted and had an epic scale definitely need to see the movie again
Oct 25 2021,positive,movie rating   910
Oct 25 2021,positive,really well done epic scale and proportion right by the book cant wait for part teo
Oct 25 2021,negative,boring very boring
Oct 25 2021,positive,amazing i cant wait for part 2
Oct 25 2021,positive,movie was good the imax sound was overbearing the sound volume is up too high this is odd coming from someone that likes loud music
Oct 25 2021,positive,beautiful cinematography
Oct 25 2021,positive,i did see the old movie many years ago which was ok but i really liked the style and feeling of this modern dune almost a clear dark star wars wibe excellent
Oct 25 2021,positive,visually stunning soundtrack was a bit over the top as a fan of the book it was cool but i dont know how much nonfans will be able to comprehend
Oct 25 2021,positive,the movie is awesome 2nd time seeing it in the theater however i preferred digital projection and dts over imax the images were darker in the imax version
Oct 25 2021,positive,absolutely fantastic movie stunning visuals great cast who give wonderful performances terrific score and amazing special effects
Oct 25 2021,positive,like a glorious epic beautiful evocative dream worst part is having to wait years for a yettobe greenlit sequel
Oct 25 2021,positive,almost everything id hoped for though some details were missing  perhaps theyll explain more in part 2 or maybe leave some details on the political backstory out entirely  the sound was amazing but overwhelmed the dialogue at times  definitely worth the imax ticket price
Oct 25 2021,positive,this is one of the few movies that completely lived up to my expectations and then some the scale of this movie along with the allstar cast is truly astonishing timothée chalamets performance solidifies him as one of the best actors of this generation and denis is solidified as one of the best directors in the last decade
Oct 25 2021,positive,this is the dune ive been waiting for excellent cast awesome sets great locations
Oct 25 2021,positive,denis villeneuve is my new favorite scifi movie man he knocks it out of the park every time this movie is gorgeous amazing acting the costumes and sets were spectacular i cannot wait for the second half and i really really really want the alien franchise to end up in this mans hands pleaseeeee
Oct 25 2021,positive,it was rather faithful they had a rather long bit at the beginning showing the actual imperial decree which was ok it missed a couple of major plot points it seems they completely skipped over the banquet with kynes completely phased over the suspicion of lady jessica plot otherwise it was decent nice visuals loved the spacers guild highliner it looked ominous and amazing one thing i wish they explained that wouldve been good for newer audiences to know is why they didnt really use any ranged weapons we saw a couple with the dart gun but a newer dune fan might not understand the holtzman effect and how the dynamic between lasgun shields and worms work i am looking forward to part 2 though
Oct 25 2021,positive,great movie was true to the book and made it easy for those who dont know the book to still know what is going on  only complaints was that the lighting in some scenes were too dark lighting wise and the music was too loud to hear the actors in a couple scenes but loved the movie
Oct 25 2021,positive,i robbed myself of an amazing experience by not watching it on the big screen 
Oct 25 2021,positive,exceeded all my highest expectations  casting and acting were incredible visuals and effects were amazing  definitely must see in a big screen theater
Oct 25 2021,positive,film is primarily monochromatic but visually interesting and impactful  great sound effects  story line closely follows 1998 movie and 2000 scifi miniseries  however new actors provide a fresh look into the characters of dune  will see again and already waiting for sequel
Oct 25 2021,positive,amazing visuals and the most brilliantly restrained effects massive objects passing in silence deadly lasers with a single thin filament the shield effect showing the danger with a simple color change  amazingly creative detailed costumes varied use of language spoken and signed    overall brilliant while setting itself far apart from the flashy aesthetics of star wars and frequent blue sky beams of marvel    love this film so much not making the sequel would be an unforgivable crime against society
Oct 25 2021,positive,villenueves adaptation of dune has proven to be a visually and audibly stunning creation true to its source material in all the important ways and some that viewers may find unfavorable as a fan of the original book i was pleasantly surprised to see so many details big and small captured in way that prior attempts to create the dune film had failed at not unlike the book this part one to which we will hopefully receive the sequel is quite slowgoing and not an immediately engaging section this being the case it will likely stand to lose the interest of the unfamiliar or the prefers fast action viewer overall the content of the film is serving its source material justice and doing so in a manner that is breathtaking to the applicable senses albeit taking the long and nearly verbatim to the book way to get there
Oct 25 2021,positive,yes its well done amazing cast of actors true to the book which i read in 2014 looking forward to the sequel and wish i had his hair 
Oct 25 2021,positive,befitting of its title as the next star wars or lord of the rings dunes scope and magnitude is breathtakingly epic sweeping the viewer up in a world of intrigue and spectacle    fans of the book and newcomers alike will find themselves captivated by the vision brought to life by villeneuve able to appreciate what small alteration were made to offer a more coherent visual experience
Oct 25 2021,positive,story is interesting the acting is top notch the visuals are amazing i hope they take their time making part 2 so as to not rush and mess up what they have started
Oct 25 2021,positive,uhh that was amazing we saw it in a dolby room and that made a world of difference when the worm rolls in our seats didnt vibrate but shook us plus the movie was beautifully acted gorgeously shot and the story and characters were epic has to be seen in cinemas no doubt about it
Oct 25 2021,positive,it takes the first 1 and 12 to really get good the first half is kind of confusing but it starts to make more sense half way through you can tell it was a book first because of all of the exposition that is needed the entire first half i am interested in the sequel if they choose to make one
Oct 25 2021,positive,cant wait for part 2 it shouldve been filmed at the same time as part 1 the worm was badass
Oct 25 2021,positive,a very good representation of the book im really looking forward to part 2
Oct 25 2021,positive,awesome and followed the book very well  exceeded expectations
Oct 25 2021,negative,dont believe the hype from movie critics if they give thumbs up dont waste 11 admission  dont waste 212 hours of your life like i did dont even watch it on tnt when its free on tv either thats how bad it is you have been warned
Oct 25 2021,positive,absolutely beautiful movie with an incredible score watch it in imax or at least a cinema
Oct 25 2021,positive,denis villeneuves dune is an ambitious thoughtprovoking and sweeping scifi epic that showcases sparkling stars that align when beauty of middle eastern culture isnt buried beneath dusty wars in faraway galaxies with his tenth feature villeneuve runs sharp blades across post 911 mythologies by drawing rich analogies with centuriesold islam history of one of the worlds most misunderstood countries its villeneuves first attempt to reinventa classic book from an islamic perspective on the bigscreen but he pulls it off seamlessly using captivating cinematography villeneuve draws viewers into space odyssey a heroic heir takes to save his planets resourcerich spice commodity villeneuves decision to shoot the film in reallife locations across the middle east is risky but it pays off tremendously inspired by david leans lawrence of arabia villeneuve effectively employs authentic arab locales to create rich cultural authenticity seldom seen in scifi movies villeneuve showcases immense control over action sequences production design and music crafting a memorable cinematic experience villeneuves screenplay is also sensational and effectively uses a dreamflashback structure to convey a messiahs journey its hard to not praise phenomenal cast performances timothee chalamet delivers his finest performance to date as paul altreides with mesmerizing expressions he captures anger determination and selfdoubts of an inquisitive family heir that seeks to savehis resourcerich planet rebecca ferguson  is also remarkable in the role of a tormented mother that puts her life on the line to protect her son the final standout in the cast is oscar isaac as a duke that doubts his sons heroism he brings paternal affections to the movie although dune is undeniably an unforgettable scifi epic ultimately it isnt a flawless film its dustily paced and loses momentum towards the end moreover the film builds to a headscratching ending that seems intended solely to setup a sequel nevertheless fans of the celebrated novel will enjoy dune and so will moviegoers seeking thoughtprovoking entertainment as rebel alliances thatve often underestimated powers of invader empire foreigners its high time hollywood awakened to force of one of the worlds most alienated countries by opening planet of apes pod doors to muslim communities even when their victories over terminatored fatherly adversaries have been considered flukes since inception of 911 ideologies
Oct 25 2021,positive,beautiful epic scifi  must see if you are a fan of the book  if you havent read the book still amazing
Oct 25 2021,positive,so good i recommend
Oct 25 2021,positive,amazing effects great acting just a tad too long
Oct 25 2021,positive,i like how faithful this version is of the book  the characters were spoton  the landscape was perfect  i went with someone who had never read the books  had only seen the 80s movie  he got a little lost with some of the plot  i think reading the book first would be helpful
Oct 25 2021,positive,despite the wonderful effects costumes and art direction this version of dune is littered with slow pacing wooden acting and unnecessary scenes that should have been cut like the 30 min action sequence featuring jason momoma which was not in the book and was not needed for the story to progress also this is possibly the worst score hans zimmer has ever created there is no stand out theme its a mix of sound effects and meditational with a dash of electronic bag pipes  what in shai huluds name was he thinking it all makes for an interesting but very flawed movie
Oct 25 2021,positive,great cinema photography
Oct 25 2021,positive,denis villeneuve is such a visionary director and he was able to bring frank herberts ambitious tale to life in a way we have never seen this is truly epic filmmaking with the type of scale and scope that the source material truly deserves crossing all fingers eyes and toes that part two gets green lit
Oct 25 2021,positive,very true to the book and visually fantastic
Oct 25 2021,positive,no idea it was part one
Oct 25 2021,positive,i am a fan of the book series i liked how it was truer to the books i think the more you are a fan of the books the more of a fan of the movie youre likely to be
Oct 25 2021,positive,so good i am very impressed very interested the whole movie    told the story very well
Oct 25 2021,positive,awesome  cant wait for chapter 2
Oct 25 2021,positive,a perfect book adaptation if you have read the books this goes above and beyond anything you could imagine as a visual representation of the subject matter i cant speak to the experience if you havent read the books but that may be a rougher experience i wholeheartedly recommend reading the books first at least the first one before watching this an absolute visual and auditory treat a mustwatch for anyone who has read and enjoyed frank herberts works
Oct 25 2021,positive,absolutely incredible amazing adaptation unbelievable cinematography
Oct 25 2021,positive,the visuals tone and environment were all spot on  you could feel the weight on young paul as the film reached it climax  let the search for part 2 begin so we can get closer to seeing it
Oct 25 2021,negative,i liked the film but it was boring for me  nearly felt sleep at second half  its overrated  might give it a second watch
Oct 25 2021,positive,faithful adaptation of the book
Oct 25 2021,positive,this instills so much faith that part 2 will be even better that it retroactively makes part 1 monumental itself for being such a good setup
Oct 25 2021,positive,beautiful worldbuilding very true to the novel
Oct 25 2021,positive,i know the critics loved it but for me it was okay i was in my mid20s when i saw the david lynch version in the theaters i was a teenager when i read the book despite its flaws and shortcomings i liked the 1984 version this one is a little bit bombastic with the blaring music and overwhelming sets i think the story and the characters get lost in the greater scope of the worldbuilding i was expecting to be wowed but instead i was mildly satisfied
Oct 25 2021,positive,epic movie worthy of a visit to the theatre to see it on the big screen
Oct 25 2021,positive,fantastic cinematographysound and visual was great alongside spending more time on chatacter development on the main protagonist
Oct 25 2021,positive,the script is very tight and must be really focused to understand it all but its not too challenging the visual and soundtracks were all top notch
Oct 25 2021,positive,where do i start wow masterpiece ive been looking forward to seeing thisever since i read the book thirtyfive years ago    ive read the book four times when i was young the book was way too deep for me it took a second and third time before i started to mine the brilliance in the story it also took experience as a reader to understand the pacing and the characterizations    the idea of adapting something this dense into a movie or a couple of movies takes real vision this is the definitive version of dune the movie    when i heard that my favorite living director was going to take the reigns of this productions i couldnt think of a better helmsman then i started seeing the casting choices the cinematographer and then the person who was going to write the score everyone is at the top of their game    i have been in talks with my friends that have not read the booksbut decided to go see the movie first then afterwards read the book and almost every one of them has thoroughly enjoyed the movie the only complaint that i heard from one was that they had not known that this was just part one of a two parter but that did not disuade them from wanting to read the book    and in some ways now the book will make more sense for a lot of people from the start denis has a way of translating difficult ideas into visual dynamism    now that weve seen it i cannot have ever truly believed that someone could take the text and visualize it as perfectly as he has the tone is perfect the idea of spending more time on caladan was brilliant to build the foundation of the battles to comeby seeing them deposed from the safe and stable planet and placed in charge of a brutal planet then allowing the harkonnens to decimate them where they stood an extermination    the acting is amazing timothy chalamet does an amazing job of being niaeve but also capable to show the boy but to see the god below the surface he plays that juxtaposition perfectly the still tent scene is a oscar worthy performance    rebecca ferguson is able show her vulnerability but also her fierceness oscar isaac as a father doing his best but put in a no win situation    stilgar played by javiar bardemwas almost unrecognizable the gravitas that he brought to his character the aloofness in front of the atriedies but the calmness and security when he was with his people the fremen    also chani being played by such a talented actress in zendaya just her look alone sets the stage for the events that transpire from here onward in the next few films if we are blessed with a part 2 and then dune messiah    hans zimmers score is amazing so evocative of the primal world and maudibs place within this raw world just listening to the score was a treat    i do hope that this movie is financially successful for we truly deserve a part twoto allow a further installments of this vision    there were numerous times that i started crying it was almost a religious experiencewhich it should befor that is the story itself the idea that the confluence of all the planning and the coming together of everything to change the worldand hes right here making his first steps ugh so good    this is already a classic film the gold standard i would go so far as to say the platinum standard such perfection in cinema
Oct 25 2021,positive,dune transports us to another time and place yet we recognize its inevitable complexity
Oct 25 2021,positive,a bit slow at start but great adaptation
Oct 25 2021,positive,i liked the movie actually but theres way too much dialogue than action but i still liked it 
Oct 25 2021,negative,25 hours of absolute boring garbage that doesnt even end
Oct 25 2021,negative,extremely mad audio mixing hard to hear dialogue and piercing loud score might have been not as boring if you shortened it and allowed us to hear the dialogue
Oct 25 2021,positive,dont judge a book by the first half of it  by paul sidharta    i can say that i am not a dune fan and i havent read the book nor will i read it one day but i remember vividly playing a dune pc game a long time ago around the 90s and how it was fantastic to allow the gamers to play each house ive been playing the game as the duke of atreides and the harkonnens baron and the games objective was simple control arrakis and crush the other houses i ended up playing the game several days straight without going out of my room    and then i remember david lynchs dune as i grew a bit older and i thought the visualization was excellent the characters were colorful however i was finding it a bit too caricatural for my liking and i was confused following the storyline    fast forward around 25 years later     as i grew more and more passionate about movies storytelling scriptwriting and directing i have my list of favorite films director sometimes i need to see who the director of the film is before i see one  sicario was my first experience of dennis way of storytelling and it was evoking exciting and in my own words intimidating but the one that swept me away was the arrival i love the story twist the production value the set design and the buildup of the characters    to cut a long story short dennis is now among the top film directors i guarantee will follow and watch his movies    would that make this review a bias one    its like you are reading a classic book and everyone is raving about it  finally after a long wait you find a delightful long weekend and you are planning to gobble it in one go such a pageturner you can stop visualizing each scene and you forget to eat to take a bath you immerse in it    but then life takes over and at half of the book you have no choice to put down that book    this experience is how i feel about the movie    do i hate the book no of course not  will i look forward to finishing it hell yes  will i share my experience with the people about the book well perhaps maybe i will wait until i finish it    back to dune part one 2021  i refrain from judging the film because i know it is not the ending     i genuinely enjoy the grand scale and how dennis put effort into each character and their purposes in the story     the starstudded casts are also a treat to watch their performance on every scene    every aspect of design set architecture spaceships wardrobe makeup fantastic music score and sound effect were excellent and looked well thoughtthrough    i can see denniss passion in every second of the film and how every person hundreds of names on the credit title helped him make his visualization come through    thats why in french the word director is translated as realisateur  and obviously he is among the best    do i hate the film no of course not i love it  will i wait for the second part of the story hell yes    i hope warner bros is smart enough to start the production of the other half of the story right away    it is heartbreaking to discover dennis willing to wait on how commercially successful the first half of the story will be in order for him to get a green light and direct or make a reality of the second part of it    i just cant wait to see part two i know it will be fantastic  because this one is almost perfect
Oct 25 2021,positive,this movie has a problem it does not go into many of the details about the politics of dune or the importance of the bene gesserit but as a fan of the books man this movie is good great casting specially oscar isaac rebecca ferguson and mr chalamet i hope we get to see part two
Oct 25 2021,positive,loved how long the movie was stated off a bit confusing because i havent read the books or seen other dune movies but it turned out pretty good awaiting the second
Oct 25 2021,positive,beautiful interpretation of an epic saga stunning visuals with such a heavy book as source material i feel like denis villeneuve created a faithful representation of the characters location and events looking forward to part 2 and then the hbo mini series of the follow up books
Oct 25 2021,positive,i really enjoyed how well they followed the plot and what changes they made to the story of dune to make it more understandable to the audience they even made some use of the show dont tell method of storytelling though they do occasionally ruin it by showing and then telling  there are 3 questionable choices i would mention and this will include minor spoilers  firstly there is the fact that they changed the sex of dr kynes i question it because kynes sex was an important way to setup the negative aspects of his character he was a father that was never around including at the birth of his own daughter he was more devoted to his mission and to educating people than he ever was to his family i think there are many other characters that could be changed basically any of the court members of paul atreides could be gender swapped and it would lack that negative effect on the characterization for some it might even add depth to their characters  the second part is how spiritual and fremen they made kynes this is because kynes is kinda meant to stand somewhat apart from the fremen in hisher specific role shehe is meant to be a leader coming from the outside and adapting to their ways while still definitely being an outsider  the final thing is that towards the end of the movie they change how leeto fights and why it looks like he is playing with his opponent originally leeto dodges and defends at full speed while slowing at the last moment on his attacks this is because he is used to fighting with shields they changed this to be about him never having taken a life this makes leeto more sympathetic to people which may end up being a positive but it does move it away from the original character who was fairly hard to truly understand    but all in all if they keep this up this will be a truly amazing series of movies and this first installment is breathtaking
Oct 25 2021,positive,i have never read the books but i have seen the david lynch film from the 80s but came into this with a completely open mind   i loved this film given its 25hrs the pacing was good and it goes very quickly visually its stunning and using practical affects rather than all cgi really adds to the world building the different planets feel real   the musicscore is not for everyone it does go with the visuals but there is no real themessoundtrack which in my opinion if there was would make this film 5 stars  acting and performances were all excellent there wasnt a weak link  if we had it on streaming in the uk i would be watching is again as there is so much to take in  personally i found the story easy to follow and you buy into the world that has been built at no point did it feel pretentious i for one hope the sequel is greenlit soon as it will be a cinematic shame if we do not see the continuation of this story
Oct 25 2021,positive,i honestly wasnt sure what to expect with this dunes been  weird as a franchise i think everyone knows the movie with sting which i suppose worked for its time the miniseries at least gave things room to grow then theres this     this is an exceptional adaptation     even if you just like visuals if you want to see concept art brought into a movie and not look out of place look at this its gorgeous the baron looks great yes even when floating around thats easy to make look silly or meh but this was an interesting and well executed bit of design and costuming     i can see some people thinking its a little jumpy with pauls visions and the like but the fact he has visions is mentioned so its not pulled out of nowhere     all in all i really really liked this movie  so why the four stars instead of five one thing i saw it in theaters and its the first time ive had a movie soundtrack feel like it was physically trying to beat me up throughout the movie not an occasional loud sound but very overbearing with music and effects volume throughout the sound design and composition is fine this is apparently not the case if you watch it streaming so im hoping they get a better mix or something out to theaters before the run ends i want this to do well  but id say for now watch it streaming and itll be much more pleasant
Oct 25 2021,neutral,sci fi movie dune was a disappointment   very slow movie  way too serious  not a fun movie to watch   sci fi needs to be more entertaining and fun to watch  marvel and dc know how to do it   boring movie  ill pass on dune ii
Oct 25 2021,positive,dune was fantastic  the only issue i have with it is the indeterminate amount of time before i get to see part ii  i hope they greenlight it and get moving  dune part i was faithful to the source material and engrossing  visually stunning well acted and good pacing more please
Oct 25 2021,negative,i say this with the greatest of affection for the directors previous work that dune is a movie constructed by exec producers using the directors visual style i sense that the choices he made were controlled by well meaning execs seeking high roi this shows in the movie and is dissipating to be honest  if you broke down the movie to the essential elements youd find an exposition dump every ten minutes action scenes that are copy cats from modern action movies safe parameters with character development commonly found in candy sucking movies its a sincere shame seeing the high ratings has nothing to do with the real integrity of this movies cinematic ambitions it falls on its face  one cant blame modern cinema goers with the current viewing patterns associated to netflix and short attention spans born from social media overuse we are seeing execs feeling motivated to deliver to that audience in leu of delivering something for the ages this is not a timeless movie sadly  and it should have been with such a wonderful director at the helm
Oct 25 2021,positive,very good way better than the previous installments excellent performances by everybody from timothee chalamet to oscar issac to josh brolin to jason momoa excellent visuals good action sequences but can be better especially group action sequences mix up some close combat sequences with blades between groups with close range firing merge individual force fields and have armies clash on the ground with unit levelbattalion level force fields looks like a lot of hard work went into this overall enjoyable movie
Oct 25 2021,positive,made with emotion and told the story with great visual seen twice already
Oct 25 2021,positive,awesome alot like the book
Oct 25 2021,positive,one of the best sci fi movies ever
Oct 25 2021,negative,what a snooze fest dennis villenevue works hard to recapture the lightning he found in arrival and especially blade runner  and fails the costumes are there the music is on point the direction and cinematography are solid but really other than the crisper images and better fx  you might as well watch the original by david lynch          im a glutton for punishment so i will rewatch this and maybe it will get better  but upon first watch this feels like some expensive made for tv bullshit     boring story awful script and a sensational cast that phoned in their performances trash through and through  the technical aspects earn the half  star
Oct 25 2021,negative,it was boring and a movie which lacked plot almost as if it was trying cover up the lack of plot by great visuals
Oct 25 2021,positive,insanely great cinematography is mind blowing music of this movie is magical
Oct 25 2021,positive,big fan of dune going way back many did not like the first adaptation because they didnt feel it did justice to frank herberts work i did like it despite its flaws however tadaptation is superior obviously owing to better technology techniques  and the hindsight of the first movie it was better at following herberts vision better casting and fitting the actor to the character and for that i give it 5 stars
Oct 25 2021,negative,stillborn  great art great cgi but humans lacked spice with wooden performances and individual elements just didnt come together to produce a story that lives and breathes  completely unconvincing as paul calumet failed to rise to the occasion incapable of emotional complexity and only managing at best to look constipatedlike a high school sophomore trying to pull off death of a salesman   skarsgard and aquaman were by far the most interesting cast members but neither got enough screen time for the movie to benefit  it looks like they shot live actors in a parking lot spent most of the budget pasting them into a cgi environment and slapped some dutyfree transcendental synth music from soundcloud over everything  not unwatchable but not epic enough to be dune
Oct 25 2021,positive,this is the best movie ive seen in many years to experience this film on an imax screen is to truly appreciate the scale and beauty of its world dune is a mustsee for any fan of science fiction epic sprawling cinema or both
Oct 25 2021,positive,i went into this movie having no knowledge of what to expect ive never seen the old dune movie and ive never read the book i came out of this thinking this movie was excellent its not a super actionpacked star wars or marvel flick so if thats what youre looking for this is not it this movie is a dark atmospheric visual masterpiece that burns slow but keeps your attention the entire time i always prefer movies that primarily convey things visually and keep the exposition to a minimum so i really enjoyed this if i do have one complaint it is that this movie kept the dialogue to such a minimal level that even someone like me would have preferred just a little more of the macro exposition and fleshing out of the characters but in my opinion its much better to be on the minimal side of exposition than the maximum side where i feel like my intelligence is being insulted really great job and i am very interested in seeing dune part ii
Oct 25 2021,positive,the movie was real good but i hated the abrupt way it ended
Oct 25 2021,negative,having read the books seen the david lynch version countless times watched the scifi channel mini series i must say this film was a complete let down  i suffered through it to see what great new aspects and opportunities to showcase more of the background of the herbertsphere these novels were based on  but not a bean    there is absolutely nothing new the characters are weak rushed and just dont fit the parts  atrocious acting and no feeling at all  its a total pigs ear of an affair and has done nothing to improve what was already there in the lynch version despite that being heavily cut    there was missed opportunity considering that part 2 was a given to explore some of the concepts the technology the differences between the houses and to look at the air of mystery surrounding the bene gesserit sisterhood  charlotte rampling could of been great had she been able to play up a bit more on the dark side  they could of worked in things like why the baron floated what was all that black gunk the baron bathed in and all these nuances that will just not make any sense to newcomers    chalomet was a bit of a weedy character and not suited  he just could not carry the role convincingly neither could rebecca ferguson  momoa seems to be cropping up everywhere in bit parts and is predictable  i just cant take him seriously  isaac was a bit plastic and brought nothing unlike the original jürgen prochnow who was commanding and believable  it would of been better having some unknowns who could act rather than these frequent faces like isaac who is in everything these days  and thats another problem that makes it not credible  you cant watch this without the saturation of momoa and isaac in loads of recent films and that just ruins it    so apart from weak characters loads of missed opportunities some wokeness thrown in for good measure and basically a painful rehash of the lynch film that was stretched out for 2½ hours it was totally underwhelming film and i am not even going to bother with the second part  a complete disappointment and a wasted opportunity
Oct 25 2021,positive,fan of the original super stoked how grand this one was and im excited to see if part two is just as good i was entertained for the whole 2 12 hours
Oct 25 2021,positive,absolutely visually breathtaking and surprisingly faithful adaptation of the first half of the book   major favs production design sense of immersion prevalence of the grey areas within the books themes and characters minor quips sound is great but does cancel out some bits of dialogue wouldve liked to have seen the roles of the antagonists more fleshed out  now gimme that second half and well see if this thing works as a whole
Oct 25 2021,positive,it was an average but very well made film too much of it was shot like a perfume advert timbo and all the cast were good but mummy cried too much
Oct 25 2021,positive,cinematic with breathtaking landscapes as any denis villeneuve film should be chalamet is kind of spaced out and disconnected for the first half of the movie but i quite liked his performance in the second half rebecca ferguson is awesome as she always is im glad denis is trying to do the novel justice because i personally think george lucas stole quite a bit from frank herbert
Oct 25 2021,positive,glorious perfection mani really dont know what to say except this movie just raised the bar  every bit of this movie had me
Oct 25 2021,positive,it is hard to imagine how this movie could be a better adaptation  of the novel it is not just the best adaptation of dune it is the best adaptation to date of any science fiction novel and one of the top ten adaptation of novels to film period    the novel itself is one of the great classics of science fantasy intricate in plot layered thematically and detailed in characterization the author frank herbert was not one for unadulterated happy endings and this movie is on track for the conclusion of mixed emotions in the presumed sequel which they simply have to make    not everyone will like it and some may have trouble following it but it is destined to be beloved by fans any flaws you spot were part of the novel and likely inherent in the chosen one genre which frankly is problematic but it is spectacular and i cant not note that jason momoa is perfect as fan favorite duncan idaho
Oct 25 2021,positive,though it deviates a bit from the original book this deviation is needed due to the huge amount of internal dialog and exposition that filled its 412 pages in this case the first 200 some odd it would be near impossible to explain all the nuances of this universe within a reasonable time frame so understandable changes were made with that said the movie is visually stunning beautifully filmed and wonderfully acted at the time of this review october 24th it has also earned 230 million at the box office has only been out for three days in the us and china and it still has yet to be shown in a few large markets such as australia prompting a rather promising chance at part two being greenlit which it desperately needs
Oct 25 2021,positive,it can be considered as a part that puts the storyline of the movie well concisely in some chapters so that the movie does not stretch too long but it also helps the back of the movie that releases the script a bit long and asks for minus 1 points with the overall ending cut it is considered a good opening chapter
Oct 25 2021,positive,dune 2021 is amazing move of the year casting and acting  fantastic the direction is spoton the dialogue the pacing the music the special effects the camerawork the overall feel and atmospherics of the movie it is on on on on plus the special effects were not overdone its got just the right mix of real footage plus the digital artists you can tell they took care to strike the perfect balance you can utterly destroy a movie like this with too much cgi and greenscreens thank the fates they had the sense not to do that    dune 2021 is giving me the same feels as did the first lord of the rings and we know how good that trilogy was cannot wait for installment two im a big fan of this director and the entire team if you want to make good scfi movies this entire crew should be preserved and be making additional films
Oct 25 2021,positive,this movie was so beautiful and lovingly made every scene is a visual treat its what the lord of the rings movies did for fantasy but for scifi its incredible
Oct 25 2021,positive,i feel as though it did justice to the book it left out key parts and didnt pay enough attention to the importance of moisture and water but i enjoyed it you can only for so much into the movies
Oct 25 2021,positive,better than any marvel or dc movie ive ever seen never been so excited about a franchise in my life
Oct 25 2021,positive,a couple of scenes were not needed and thanos needed a proper kill and batista needed to duel jason mamoa
Oct 25 2021,positive,im not familiar with the book or the dune universe but i found myself in awe at how well thought out every element of the film was from the casting to the costuming cinematography the sound the effects the lighting and the direction all added to the feel of the piece and no element felt less important than the other what i really am amazed at is this seems to be 2 hours of setting up the real story  and i wasnt bothered by that at all do not see this film at home first make sure you see it in a theater with great sound and screen capabilities
Oct 25 2021,positive,i was worried at the remake would be insulting or annoying because i loved the original when i saw and felt watching this movie was excitement and enthusiasm for more well he was very well done the acting was excellent i cannot wait for part two
Oct 25 2021,positive,true to the book  great flick
Oct 25 2021,positive,must watch this movie defies all the stigma truly a work of art
Oct 25 2021,positive,an experience this is the way movies are meant to be watched
Oct 25 2021,positive,grandiose spectacular a true experience on the big screen more unfinished
Oct 25 2021,positive,awe inspiring visually stunning a vivid harsh world of epic scope and scale so happy to see something like this being made in our time a passion project that delivers and lets people hope for more installments to come
Oct 25 2021,negative,boring lack of character development apart from the digital effects which arent super exciting in 2021 it wasnt really something id watch again
Oct 25 2021,positive,visually stunning epic i felt completely immersed try seeing it in imax but with hbo max also is a good experience
Oct 25 2021,negative,slow too dark somewhat boring incomplete 
Oct 25 2021,positive,nice movie a little slow beat but the plot is awesome i cant expect to watch the development of this saga
Oct 25 2021,negative,it was not epic like the originali yawned during the movie
Oct 25 2021,positive,absolutely loved it beautiful cinematics and excellent characters
Oct 25 2021,positive,we truly enjoyed the movie looking forward for part 2
Oct 25 2021,positive,a little slow moving at first but absolutely necessary amazing cinematics and sound and the effects were equally stunning
Oct 25 2021,positive,truly epic visuals  sound one of those rare cases where the movie is better than the book
Oct 25 2021,positive,although the story isnt as strong as in the book the atmosphere more than makes up for it my movie of 2021
Oct 25 2021,positive,eyes were glued to the screen the entire time loved it
Oct 25 2021,positive,this was one of the best movies i have seen in a long time yes some parts were a little slow but i understand they had to build a world for people who are unfamiliar with the original story
Oct 25 2021,positive,an amazing adaptation of the book the epic story was given room to breathe casting all around was perfect the visuals were absolutely top notch
Oct 25 2021,positive,the atmosphere and story telling is awesome however may be a little slow and confusing for people that have not read the book it amazingly stays faithful to its source material
Oct 25 2021,positive,very faithful to the novel and artistically quite reminiscent to the 1984 david lynch great scoring great big sand worms great big harkonnens a tremendous work of art
Oct 25 2021,positive,very true to the book writing acting sets costumes all at least met my expectations i cant wait for part 2    probably the point where i was really convinced was when paul is taken to meet the bene gesserit mother its a crucial scene in the book and it was pulled off perfectly    after the last awful try to bring this to the big screen written by lynch but ruined by de laurentiis i was guardedly hopeful did not disappoint
Oct 25 2021,negative,the characters were unappealing and bland making me feel nothing for them i didnt like the tone of the movie because there wasnt a single lighthearted scene in it i dont have a problem with a dark movie but for the audience to feel the impact of the dark themes it also needs some lighthearted scenes eyes get used to the darkness just like you get used to the dark tone after a while which makes it really boring the last hour had me yawning and waiting for the movie to end it even got me checking my phone which never happens when im in the movie theater     the themes in the movie were explained very vaguely i wasnt the only one who was always a bit confused on what was happening on screen the movie didnt give me any reason to care for the war and characters either     the visuals were amazing and the action at the end of the movie wasnt too bad it was overall just a boring movie i think that they couldve done a better job
Oct 25 2021,positive,visuals and music are top notch and must see in imax
Oct 25 2021,positive,first time ever seeing dune havent watched the old or read the books  what an amazing world building experience  beautiful  artistic  left me wanting more cant wait for part 2
Oct 25 2021,positive,not bad but not a movie i would enjoy watching over and over again
Oct 25 2021,positive,awesome but left a little wanting
Oct 25 2021,positive,the photography and score were amazing the lore was communicated in a way that a person who hasnt read the book could grasp it and get immersed i think there will be a big following whos first exposure to dune is this movie the scenes where gaius helen mohiam arrives and tests paul were spectacular
Oct 25 2021,positive,just finished watching dune and i could only describe it in one word  epic
Oct 25 2021,positive,the costumes special effects and cinematography are magnificent the cast was great the story was a bit slow but it was a nice setup for the next movie
Oct 25 2021,positive,the storytelling visuals and musical score were simply incredible as a fan of the books an absolute mustsee
Oct 25 2021,negative,worst movie ive seen this year
Oct 25 2021,negative,so boring it is what you would call a dragger 
Oct 25 2021,positive,an absolute monster a faithful interpretation of the classic novel denis villeneuves passion for the project is evident in a myriad of examples a rare example of the magic of cinema in todays age i was brought to tears at the outright spectacle of it all    i also wouldnt put too much stock into the crass 12  1 star reviews here this is a thinking mans film back to marvel you go if you dont like it
Oct 25 2021,negative,no plot and superrrrrrr boring
Oct 25 2021,positive,the best movie ive seen this year the length of the movie was long enough to explain the world and character build i didnt feel like i was in the theater that long and honestly could have sat there longer to found out whats next this is one of the few gems to come out of hollywood in recent time 
Oct 25 2021,positive,i loved this movie  because of all the actors cinematography music sets computergenerated images landscapes directors imagination and passion costumes large scope i loved the book so this brought it to life
Oct 25 2021,positive,a cinema event for the ages soulful wondrous faithful to the source material and astonishingly epic
Oct 25 2021,positive,in one scene you literally watch a helicopter flying for 10 minutes with no reprieve these overlong unimportant action shots take 60 minutes of potentially good film into 150 minutes of trying to stay awake
Oct 25 2021,positive,great movie and great visuals
Oct 25 2021,positive,im not familiar with the dune story so i came into it not knowing anything about the story line  i loved this movie and literally applauded at the end of it  im the type that doesnt need an action packed from start to finish experience  just give me a good story good characters good acting i love a movie with good cinematography good character development and a compelling plot that i can immerse myself into the characters   this movie had all that  its kind of like interstellar was for me  a grand cinematic experience that had a compelling story to tell
Oct 25 2021,positive,i mean wow stunning visuals amazing cast awesome story i have no complaints for this film it was truly a work of art
Oct 25 2021,negative,there are only a handful of movies i have wanted to walk out on this one was one of those there are so many ways that this was a terrible movie that i will probably miss some however let me start by saying i read the dune books before the original movie came out in 1984 i believe having that background caused me to not find anything about this movie to be novel or unique in its storyline unlike my friend who was completely unfamiliar with dune and frank herbert    as to this movie i questioned the casting of timothee chalamet from way back when it was announced what a terrible casting job the same could be said for duncan idahos jason momoa who does not have very strong acting chops vladamir and raban harkonnen are either poorly cast or suffer from such terrible dialogue that it just seems that way    to that the writing in this movie was ridiculous and the dialogue was poorly delivered andor directed this entire movie lacked any genuine feel and seemed like actors reading lines and the cinematography and music were way over the top every minute there was a big crescendo and some big landscape image that was supposed to give the movie some kind of epic feel the problem was that this was constant and when that is the case the movie lacks flow and contrast and ceases to be dynamic    lastly they dont tell you up front that this movie is part 1 so the original movie in 1984 complete with the vocabulary list they handed out in the theater was perhaps 45 minutes too short at 2h 17m this movie at 2h 35m was far too long for having covered up only up to the point that paul and jessica are embraced by the fremen they could have used that time to teach us more about the origin of the mentats or dr yuehs imperial conditioning we also did not get to meet feydrautha played by sting in the original assume they complete the original dune movie in just two parts and the second half is as long as part one if that is the case they will have used almost 3hrs more to tell the same story as was told in 1984 but with no additional story plot or character development    this movie was a huge disappointment and the scores ive seen are equally shocking i can only guess that most of those high scores are from those unfamiliar with dune and that find the body shields ornithopters and frank herbert other ideas as new and refreshing
Oct 25 2021,positive,this movie is one of those rare instances where the movie improves significantly upon the famous but slow moving book  although the book fills in some details if you have not read the book dont bother  just see the movie which is much better
Oct 25 2021,positive,awesome adaptation great cast and visual effects i am very invested in the sequel warner bros we need a release date
Oct 25 2021,positive,a cinematic experience unlike any other
Oct 25 2021,positive,i  enjoyed it even though i didnt understand what was going on  it was like watching a serbocroatian movie without subtitles  i suspect everybody who worked on the movie had read the book 8 or 10 times and forgot that some people in the audience might not have read it even once  but it was captivating visually so i rate it  high   i suppose theres a part 2 to finish the story
Oct 25 2021,positive,spectacular frank herberts story is brought to life and made me believe in the dune universe this movie is exceptional and my only criticism is that it ended and the sequel dune part two is not filming yet
Oct 25 2021,positive,the visuals are great and the characters and actors are great but i dont know if someone who is not aware of the material would get the story 100  when it was over it left me wanting more which is probably the best compliment i can give  there could be so much more to come and i hope they have the resolve to see it through
Oct 25 2021,negative,fantastic cast that was entirely wasted no emotion no attachment no payoff the film was garbage 
Oct 25 2021,neutral,i feel like i watched a pilot for a tv show im really going to like and the pilot was 25 hours long absolutely wonderful visuals but this story was missing an overall a conflictresolution that was satisfying like the big moment resolution was missing and is being purposely saved for a sequel atleast give me some resolution to feel good about in this near 3 hour film
Oct 25 2021,positive,wow definitely see in imax should win oscar for sound 
Oct 25 2021,negative,decent at best the 1980s version had much better acting everything about this movie felt lazy it just screamed  remake for the money didnt feel like they really wanted to improve on it at all that along with the fact that it dosnt even tell the whole story just ruins it do yourself a favor and watch the old version instead
Oct 25 2021,positive,this movie is a good setup to the upcoming movies in this franchise great visuals interesting story a little on the long side but given the books were around 800 pages id say its worth the watch if you like scifi timothee and zendaya youll like this movie
Oct 25 2021,positive,phenomenal cannot wait for part two
Oct 25 2021,positive,going in with no expectations it was pretty dang good im sure it missed key elements of the story etc but it drew me in and had a feel of more classic intergalactic governance movies that people love versus the goofy special effects wet dreams typically found today it felt like a real future and a real effed up government casting was pretty excellent although i frankly found jason momoa a bit difficult to take seriously looking forward to part 2
Oct 25 2021,positive,loved loved loved it it was beautifully done
Oct 25 2021,positive,cant wait for the second part
Oct 25 2021,negative,what a waste of a chance to make a good movie  why cut away when the tooth was crushed and the poison gas spreads  this movie sucked  doesnt hold a candle to the original
Oct 25 2021,positive,enjoyed the movie the intriguing actionfilled dynastic politics feels like waterdowned game of thrones in space only instead of dragons we have worms instead of starks and lannister we have atreides and harkonnen     the movie boasts a starstudded cast has great visuals and a tightly written plot but it still lacks an ending for such a grand movie it didnt have a climax scene or awe and shock factor    also i do feel that it could have easily been a miniseries exploring the many side characters instead of just brushing over them while the movie is spectacular to look at it is kind of boring at times this feels like a prologue to a series or multiseries movies and if so it does the job amazingly
Oct 25 2021,positive,it was very close to the book  the effects were outstanding  the characters matched the acts perfectly  we enjoyed it and cant wait for the next one
Oct 25 2021,positive,i saw dune at home last night and i havent stopped thinking about it the film was stunning right from the beginning and i wanted to offer support to the risks villeneuve took in this type of storytelling he gave this story a vast space in which he allowed it to simply exist and allowed the audience to experience a future unlike anything ive ever seen at times it truly felt like a vision of a world that is so far beyond my imagination that i could barely fathom what was going on and i loved it i felt like an ape seeing new york city for the first time  amazed scared confused unable to take my eyes off it    hollywood filmmaking has so many conventional ideas about how to tell stories that get recycled over and over in predictable ways they use an array of tropes to lead viewers by the hand from place to place so that the story is mostly obvious it makes movies digestable to a mass market audience but it just feels dull to me its like watching random movies from the 50s that all have the same generic sense of drama and follow the same general story beats    dune seemed to eschew all of this it treats the audience like paul himself  thrown into a dangerous story thats already in motion scraping bits of comprehension where it can be found struggling to grasp everything thats unfolding you dont necessarily know who every single person is or what every single piece of technology is doing or where every faction comes from or exactly how they interact i adore this type of world building its like youre dropped into a livedin world that really exists and wasnt just conjured up like an amuseument park for your satisfaction    the visual storytelling was unparalleled the movie just radiates mood and style and it contributes to a feeling of otherness i almost lack a word for this its like this distant future that has a distinct feeling about it in the same way as you might get from immersing yourself in the medieval section of a museum their social mores their aesthetic their way of communicating their beliefs theyre all so far removed from modernness that the mood itself becomes a setting i didnt need to be told what every little thing was to have an instinctive feeling about it all of their peculiar technology the abilities of the bene gesserit the motives driving each character and faction  it all seemed to be calculated in a perfect way so that i could get enough understanding to not be totally lost    i know that many book readers are undoubtedly disappointed to see bits they loved not included i know that feeling from other films  series where i have read the books yet a film is a film it isnt  cant be  the novel its more of a shadow cast by it villeneuve made a film that felt overwhelmingly shakespearean to me it was the story of a young scion of a great family that was led to their demise by betrayal serving the megalomania of a paranoid ruler leading him to a destiny he was forced into thats the essence of what i got from it and i loved how classic and simple it is at the core of this turbulent world youre thrown into it was like a raft i could cling to in a narrative sea that wanted to drown me everywhere i looked and allowed me to appreciate the weird majesty of it all    look i know im being a bit overly flowery in my praise of this movie but it was a profoundly awesome experience the sound design was superb the concepts unfurled with this perfect balance of mystery and explanation the journey was incredibly memorable i thought it was perhaps one of the best setups of a story ive ever seen it got me completely hooked and invested in the next film    i completely understand why many others will find this boring or slow or otherwise falling short of some arbitrary mark they set themselves but i appreciate this movie for what it is its a singular vision that i will always remember like star wars a new hope or 2001 a space odyssey the 84 dune was interesting in its own regard but this was in an entirely different galaxy of achievement in my eyes i cant wait to watch it again and hope im able to catch it in imax one of these days
Oct 25 2021,positive,i saw it on hbo max and im so impressed that im going for another viewing at the theater    i havent rewatched a movie since avatar 
Oct 25 2021,negative,very slow moving have popcorn and soda ready all the time or you will fall asleep a lot the director could have edited the full hour of unneeded scenes
Oct 25 2021,positive,it was casted well acted well written well had the best scoring and sound effects ive heard since blade runner 2049 and i loved it
Oct 25 2021,positive,stop abruptly but everything i was looking for
Oct 25 2021,negative,difficult story line
Oct 25 2021,negative,a couldbe good story told absolutely wrong this film could have been good if it had been one hour shorter but the abuse of slomo dream sequences and a neverending drone one note soundtrack makes it unbearable  similar to blade runner 2049 and all of zack snyders comic book films this movie takes itself way too seriously making sure there is not one smile in the audience for over two and a half hours in the cinema i was in at least 3 groups of people left midscreening
Oct 25 2021,positive,a visually stunning film with some good acting performances but also an otiose film which fails to present actions scenes and a remarkable climax and 3rd act
Oct 25 2021,positive,i was blown away by this movie  it was gorgeous and grand  it really took its time with the source material and didnt try to rush  the cast was amazing especially lady jessica  other sci fi these days often gets bogged down with huge battles and too much cgi but this had an introspective spiritual quality to it that was fascinating  im so excited for part 2
Oct 25 2021,positive,drop what youre doing and see this movie
Oct 25 2021,positive,my wife and i absolutely loved it sweeping scale great acting and action and so much depth to the worlds and lore bring on part 2
Oct 25 2021,positive,enjoyed it  true enough to story
Oct 25 2021,positive,faithful to the book and visually stunning
Oct 25 2021,positive,beautiful film some parts could be a little slow but rarely have i seen a movie so engrossing scifi at its best
Oct 25 2021,positive,the visuals were stunning seems rushed to try to fit in too much in a short period
Oct 25 2021,negative,felt so long and complicated i watched it with 5 people and no one cared or remember much of anything at the end 
Oct 25 2021,positive,the best muslim representation in a hollywood movie ive ever seen very islamic themes even the term mahdi deep mystical movie about the liberator of the oppressed
Oct 25 2021,positive,so good i had to see it twice
Oct 25 2021,positive,i loved sharing the dune story with my kiddos theyre hooked my grandpa would have loved this moving
Oct 25 2021,positive,great actors great visual effects but i really wish i wouldve known a bit more about the movie before i watched it and i really wish i knew that this is just part 1 of the story so the movie felt really incomplete and the ending was horrible and i was disappointed because zendaya only had 5 minutes of screen time in the 2 hour and 35 minute movie the trailer made it look as if she was a main character
Oct 25 2021,positive,stunning visuals captivating storyline superb remake of the original everything you want in a movie and more with an incredible cast
Oct 25 2021,positive,a beautiful adaptation of an iconic scifi epic
Oct 25 2021,positive,spoilers  its difficult to spoil a book published 56 years ago that spawned a previous movie and at least two cable tv miniseries but i want to be fair to firsttime watchers unaware of dune    in no particular order    the bad   the mothers character lady jessica is made waaaay too sympathetic for the audience she was selfish and powerhungry   she defied her order of witches the bene gesserit by giving birth to a son   she only gave birth to a son to ensure it was her bloodline to fulfill the prophecy of the first male witch of the order   since she was only a concubine of duke atredies she also wanted her bloodline to reign we get none of this from the movie   whats so special about the spice mélange did i hear you ask  hell if you know because there was zero made clear about its importance in the movie   the spice allows instantaneous travel across the universe by folding space an important detail not emphasized or wellexplained   the spice only exists on arrakis   the potency of royal and political intrigue was watered down to insignificance   a musical score and can make or break a movie  this score broke the movie  there are no memorable music cues thus making this movie unworthy of seeing as a theater experience   baron harkonnen played by skarsgård is portrayed as a mean fat guy  the character was a sadistic deviant of the highest order but were given an angry guy who floats around and eats a lot  this was an immense missed opportunity   lack of emphasis on whats so special about lady jessicas and pauls fighting abilities its important to the plot and yet is not conveyed   the movie is essentially to be continued yet i feel no excitement to see what follows because of my aforementioned analysis this is a 25 hour experience and everything ive mentioned and more could easily have been contained and conveyed in that time span    the good   cinematography is about as good as it gets there are masters of their craft at the helm and it shows   lighting    overall atmosphere      good special effects   some wellthoughtout concepts with aircraft for example that must operate in a sandy desert environment     costumes were hit or miss but ill place this under good because it was mostly hit   military armor was adequate   freemen still suits were good   other costumes bland but made a minor statement    i am not one of those folks who will say its not as good as the book  it can never be nor should it be so  to bring a book from a written medium to a visual one means changes have to be made  the two mediums communicate their messages using different languages  and im okay with that    overall this is not a bad movie just not a great one  a slightly above average affair but not worth a moviegoing to experience  watch it on cable streaming or bluray when available
Oct 25 2021,positive,fastest 2 hrs and 35 minutes at a movie i have ever spent  the only thing bad about this movie is that they have not started the chapter 2 yet to finish off the story
Oct 25 2021,positive,every bit of 2 12 hours visually stunning but think i would have enjoyed this film way more at home pacing makes for torturous  theatre experience
Oct 25 2021,positive,incredible  was screaming at the screen when it ended within the last few minutes i was literally saying to myself i could watch four more hours of this and please god dont let it end here its like i watched this amazing pilot to a tv show that covered so much ground and got me so hooked and then it ended so yeah im gonna need that sequel asap in fact i hope they make an entire franchise of this i feel like i just got a taste of what this storyworld can offer
Oct 25 2021,positive,overall i do like this in the end but its long and at some points boring the visual effects are great for 2021 it started out good but went way farther than it needed too
Oct 25 2021,negative,i guess this was  a different way of telling this story which is my all time favorite epic scifi story of all time i liked the david lynchs version better the newer version was not all that sorry im gonna guess theres a sequel you had great actors in it although you left me hangin
Oct 25 2021,negative,i thought this was a very dull movie i didnt feel invested in what was happening nor did i care for all of the hype i was hearing about this film i am very disappointed seems like all of the positive reviews were from people who had something to gain from the films high marks dont waste your time with this
Oct 25 2021,positive,book fan awesome adaptation  going to see it again next week 
Oct 25 2021,positive,a beautifully done movie full of world building its a well presented science fantasy this is however only part 1
Oct 25 2021,positive,liked the movie terrible theater experience
Oct 25 2021,negative,first off im not that much into scifi films recall a bit of the 1981 version of this film and thought why not there are occasional films that are scifi and decent not solely banking on the visuals but im afraid that this is one of those films at that the computer animation isnt any different than other films from the last 35 years i personally liked the new version of blade runner vs this additionally i liked the mad max film that came out a few years ago which was visually great too it just a relief that this film was on hbo max because i would have been finding another film to go watch within the theatre
Oct 25 2021,positive,was what i expected cold and stiff but treated to a titanic and vast spectacle if you like unnecessarily vast buildings and structures this film is pornography to your eyes needs to be seen at the cinema in imax definitely is a part 1 and not a standalone feature needs a sequel
Oct 25 2021,positive,literally so much lore and story to coveri cant wait to see 2nd part really hope this movie does well
Oct 25 2021,negative,once again hollywood misses the point of herberts work entirely  this dragging snoozefest is overdesigned overdirected and more selfindulgent than eyes wide shut  does chalamet have the ability to express well anything  heres a hint if a movie says its the next star wars or lotr that should be a huge warning sign  when a directorproducer sets out to make the next big thing they will usually fail as they did with dune  if you read the books this adaptation should make you wish you were eaten by shaihulud  the 15 starts are for jason mamoa and josh brolin
Oct 25 2021,positive,absolutely beautiful  the visuals and score are etched in my memory
Oct 25 2021,positive,denis reminded the world why we go to cinemas 
Oct 25 2021,positive,simply fantastic breathtaking visuals and soundtrack brilliant casting for the most part and so so faithful to the book an impressively wellexecuted adaptation of a sprawling and challenging text
Oct 25 2021,positive,it was a bit confusing at first and then i started to like it more and more looking forward to the next one this movie feels like its gonna be one of those fever trilogies
Oct 25 2021,positive,i loved it i wish they filmed it simultaneously as a trilogy to give time to all the original themes ive been waiting a long time for an original scifi thriller that focused on the right things that make a scifi movie great
Oct 25 2021,positive,best sci fi movie in 2021
Oct 25 2021,positive,a perfect scifilm the acting was superb although long the movie was perfectly paced with no unneeded scenes i truly hope that part two will retain the director because this was brilliant 
Oct 25 2021,positive,such a good movie cant wait for part two
Oct 25 2021,negative,a huge villeneuve fan but this isnt it bombastic paced poorly and with weak characterizations the spectacle was good for 15 minutes and i started to wish for better movies that this was aspiring to lawrence of arabia apocalypse now once upon a time in the west and his own movies like blade runner 2049 arrival incendies not sure why this is getting decent critical and audience scores there is a difference between slow burn and boring the biggest due appointment of the year lynchs movie was a mess but at least that had some fun
Oct 25 2021,positive,cant wait for part 2 phenomenal perfect pacing
Oct 25 2021,positive,amazing visuals that are slightly bogged by its mildly confusing dialogue and storyline
Oct 25 2021,positive,they got it rightvery good movie cant wait to see the next installment
Oct 25 2021,positive,visually stunning  everything was fantastic  i cannot wait for part 2
Oct 25 2021,negative,as someone who loved the books the 1984 version and adored the 2000 scifi channel miniseries  this was the most  slow boring  bad acted version of the three so many plot point skipped character gender changed none of the characters in this version are likable or believable  another example of computer special effects being used instead of good acting and coherent script hollywood its time to clean house and get some actually talented people
Oct 25 2021,negative,confusingjust a bad movie
Oct 25 2021,positive,the film was just visually stunning the score was brilliant it felt genuinely alien it is true a piece of cinematic art  there is a lot of material in the books and the film didnt over do it it hit the critical points spot on  the studio needs to make part 2 asap  if not it would be a travesty  get on it
Oct 25 2021,positive,excellent movie it truly keeps you wanting more as you learn about the universe it takes place in the characters in the movie clearly understand their roles and give life to the production
Oct 25 2021,positive,beautiful cgi felt true to the book where the previous movie was not up to the scale of the story
Oct 25 2021,negative,so so so so so so boring pacing was terrible jumping all over the place
Oct 25 2021,positive,finally a very well made dune movie very well worth the watch
Oct 25 2021,positive,i surely hope the greenlighting of dune part two is not based entirely on box office numbers  especially since warner bros foolishly decided to release part one both in theaters and via hbo max we opted to see it in the theater then again the next day on hbo max and i can tell you the experience in the theater vastly outweighed watching it at home on tv nobodys reading this particular review but jut in case you are please go see dune in the theater were seriously considering going back to the theater just for the experience and to hear the sardukar throat singing in dolby surround sound which is about as frightinginteresting as the annihilation music    the movie itself is brilliant dune and no time to die are pretty much a tie for the 2021 immersion award  i found myself getting lost within both pictures you feel like youre a part of the story dunes world building is so much grander than the 1984 version  and considering this movie spent 2 hours and 35 minutes to tell about the first 1 hour and 8 minutes worth of the 1984 version theres a lot more room for everyone to move around every scene propels the story forward naturally and deliberately it is a scifi story though so you might have thoughts like well why arent spice melange harvesters built so they can fly away and not have to wait for distant carryalls to rescue them from imminent worm digestion to that i might say its a movie shut the fuck up or maybe thats just the equipment they had since they were left with really lousy equipment in fact i like both responses    i havent seen the french dispatch yet thats tomorrows movie but so far dune boasts the best casting for a movie in 2021 im not very familiar with timothée chalamets previous work but he was born to play paul atreides zendaya makes a stellar chani from the little screen time we get of her in pt 1 i cant imagine a better choice for gurney halleck than josh brolin  hes perfect ive never given much thought to the character of stilgar until i watched javier bardem fill his stillsuit  holy crap what a presence rebecca ferguson oscar isaac stellan skarsgård jason momoa sharon duncanbrewster stephen mckinley henderson chen chang charlotte rampling david dastmalchian and babs olusanmokun are all fantastic in their roles and were expertly cast shit even charlie rawes who i recognized as the jealous scary and huge londoner who chases coach beard all over season 2 episode 9 of ted lasso was great in his brief yet violent scene as a harkonnen jerk the only questionable role was dave bautista as the beast rabban he has acting chops ive seen them in guardians movies spectre where he said only one word and especially in blade runner 2049 the understated sadness of his sapper punctuated by the characters brutality really set the tone for that movie and i wish we had gotten more of that bautista than what we got in dune    the ships are inventive the battles are intense the fighting is otherworldly and the political intrigue is fascinating    get past how harkonnen is pronounced and that dr lietkynes is not a white guy but a black woman gone are irulans cold dead narration the ridiculous internal thoughts and monologues of each character and weirding modules that use sound as a weapon from the 1984 lynch version this dune is a serious movie and it finally lives up to the source material    i look forward to meeting princess irulan padishah emporer shaddam iv alia atreides and especially feydrautha harkonnen in part two i also look forward to certain parentages revelations and events sure to come in part two i cannot believe the second part hasnt even been greenlit yet hurry up with that warner bros    if dreams are messages from the deep then i deeply hope we get pt 2 by 2023
Oct 25 2021,positive,may very well be the start of something special
Oct 25 2021,positive,photography is truly inspiring  as was the acting frank herbert would be applauding himself were he able to view this film i found the acting to be nuanced and the casting very fine best seen on a big screen
Oct 25 2021,positive,loved the soundtrack very cinematic stayed mostly true to the book
Oct 25 2021,positive,it looks like they tried to be fairly true to the books but some of the changes were a little strange production value was very good
Oct 25 2021,positive,imax definitely the way to go awesome
Oct 25 2021,positive,good stuff worth seeing on the big screen
Oct 25 2021,positive,great story and special effects  not sure why they didnt finish the first book
Oct 25 2021,positive,wow yes good need more movies like this
Oct 25 2021,positive,great start speculating on how many more in the series loved the casting this dune fan was really impressed with how well they followed the story line  and the minor liberties taken moved the plot along or helped folks who havent read dune a dozen times to follow
Oct 25 2021,negative,plot is slow boring and very predictable the king is betrayed by one of his close servants why you guessed it because his wife was abducted lame and predictable also this is the kind of movie were in the future only spaceships have technology the rest of things none according to this movie still man to man combat with a sword seriously fking dumb not even today theres a man to man combat with a knfe
Oct 25 2021,positive,incredible epic story and soundtrack
Oct 25 2021,positive,if you go into this film expecting to see a full story with a beginning middle and end then expect to leave somewhat disappointed within the context of this being part one of two this film does just enough to get you invested in the characters  and story while displaying some of the most beautiful and massive visuals ever created the score matches the visuals in beauty and scale as well     while by no means a perfect film it does so much right that its hard to walk away without revisiting memories of the experience definitely a must see for anyone who still isnt over how bad the last jedi was
Oct 25 2021,positive,i expected a big loud allstar extravaganza with tons of eyepopping cg and thats exactly what i got what i didnt get was a compelling story with characters i feel invested in maybe the sequels will deliver both but im not betting on it for most of the first 90 minutes i was alternately bored with the overly ponderous mood and sluggish pacing or annoyed with being too often left to guess whats going on yet another pumping churning driving soundtrack from hans zimmer though so if youre a fan like me theres that
Oct 25 2021,positive,great sound very slow building plot that has a lot of epic moments but overall it feels lifeless
Oct 25 2021,positive,i loved the cinematography
Oct 25 2021,positive,gorgeous adaptation of frank huberts dune denis followed through as promised cannot wait for part two
Oct 25 2021,negative,im certain for book readers this film was a holy grail as a movie watcher it did not resonate with me
Oct 25 2021,negative,this movie was drawn out too long i was confused and bored most of the time my dad and husband loved it though so could be just me after 1 hour i couldnt stand to watch another 15 hours i ubered home thats how much i didnt like it haha
Oct 25 2021,positive,see this on the biggest screen you can an astounding film one of the best science fiction films ever
Oct 25 2021,positive,finally an artistic blockbuster made by artists and the result is fantastic  even if the story is way ahead of our used to scifi stories the acting the visuals and soundmusic is worth the time in the dark theater  loved it will see it again and again there are visuals i will never forget
Oct 25 2021,positive,fantastic cast and effects  i felt transported to a different world  i cant wait to watch it again to try to catch stuff i missed  hold on tight and enjoy the ride
Oct 25 2021,positive,very true to the original movie
Oct 25 2021,positive,crazy movie ive never read the books nor have i seen the original movie but i love the cast including timothee chalmet rebecca ferguson jason momoa zendaya oscar issac dave bautista and others it did kinda drag in some parts but the vast richness of the movie and the set up for the next chapters make up for it i loved the music setting action scenes and story cant wait for part 2 soon whenever that will be released 
Oct 25 2021,positive,with beautiful imagery yet without any engaging characters and snail like pacing dune is large and epic yet still feels so hollow and empty despite its promise of bigger and better things in its uncertain future
Oct 25 2021,positive,i am a big fan of the original dune and although this is actually really good there was nothing indicating that this was only part one and based on research it looks like they havent even started the 2nd half  that means this is only half a movie  although this is good i find it hard to recommend it since there is nothing to look forward to
Oct 25 2021,positive,havent seen anything so great since star wars or lord of the rings cant wait for the next one just wow 
Oct 25 2021,negative,boring seems like theyre trying to just set up for the next one but in the process made me lose all interest very slow barely any action could barely understand what people were saying zendaya is on the poster but dont expect to really see her until the end
Oct 25 2021,positive,cant wait for part 2
Oct 25 2021,positive,great visuals solid acting an excellent adaptation of the source only downside is that the run time is a bit long
Oct 25 2021,positive,beautiful in every respect light years better than the previous incarnations all the better if you are familiar with the source material but not necessary to enjoy the film
Oct 25 2021,positive,epic but to be continued
Oct 25 2021,positive,a phenomenal movie visually stunning best viewed on big tvs 50 it is definitely a lot of build up to the rest of the series but it still stands very well on its own the design was great acting was really really good plot is interesting but you have to pay attention my only complaint is that some lines are hard to hear this issue is few and far between i did watch it at home for the first time it may be easier to hear some of the lines in the theatre    45 i want to see where the rest of the story leads
Oct 25 2021,positive,i cant think of how they could have made this better  so pleased with everything they did in the movie i did read the book btw    btw leave it to idiots like the new yorker to trash the movie  completely out of touch with reality  more reason that the rt score that is upfront is the audience score not the fullofthemselves professional reviewers
Oct 25 2021,positive,what any fan of the books could have hoped for
Oct 25 2021,negative,rip off of star wars never saw a movie that was to slow but at the same time i couldnt keep up the visuals and camera angles are beautiful but the only good
Oct 25 2021,positive,i love the original and this one did not disappoint me  just wished they would have advertised that this is part 1  i need the next movie to come out asap
Oct 25 2021,positive,thought it was funny that aliens from whenever and wherever use the same unit of measure that we do  kilometers  guess that makes the metric system universal
Oct 25 2021,positive,very beautiful visuals but was just kind of slow dull and boring to me
Oct 25 2021,positive,epic scale im going to be really upset if this story doesnt get finished
Oct 25 2021,negative,i would have given dune four stars but it was only half a movie so it only gets two dont go to this movie if you want to see a complete story it just stops right in the middle no resolution no explanation it just ends what a waste
Oct 25 2021,positive,dune itched what star wars hasnt been able to over the past decade
Oct 25 2021,positive,excellent i didnt fall asleep that says a lot since the reviews said the 1st hour was slow the first half of the move had some great character development helped with the awesome visuals 
Oct 25 2021,positive,stunning cinematography engrossing story relatable protagonists    1010 cannot wait for the continuation of the story
Oct 25 2021,positive,dune 1984 i had not read dune so i like this version  dune 2021 having since read dune and i like this new movie much more than the old version  it made more sense than the 84 version which looking back was a bit ridiculous  its not a perfect movie but its a much better representation of the book and the pacing does signal the expectation of more movies but im ok with that
Oct 25 2021,positive,started off kind of slow and confusing but most good movies do because then it got great amazing performances from all of the cast and the visuals are phenomenal
Oct 25 2021,negative,it was a terrible movie way too slow there were too many things left unexplained too many visions and daydreaming weak death scenes too much fake honor too much silence and orchestra music only one real action scene and what was the purpose of zendaya or jason mamoas roles after 2hrs and 35 min of fighting my sleep while watching this i still dont know what the movie was about lol 
Oct 25 2021,positive,love it big fan of the books although its been years since i read them and i sort of liked the old movie this one is exceptional the cinematography is beautiful and the special effects are great and its well cast ill likely see it again the theater and cant wait for part ii
Oct 25 2021,positive,outstanding a faithful adaptation while still bringing in its own moments and changes the visuals are incredible the sound design was immersive the thopter blades shaking my seats were incredible and the worms visual design was varied interesting and unique the acting was excellent some moments of tension were told almost entirely in facial expressions and it was excellent i absolutely look forward to a conclusionpart 2 i would love to see this team take on the whole series i recommend seeing this one in theatres i have the ability to see it at home but watched it in cinema first and may watch it again at home
Oct 25 2021,positive,stunning visuals and great character development cantwait for part 2
Oct 25 2021,positive,it is a film with an opening scene that in general people who do not know anything about dune will not understand about the film but on the contrary it has an excellent soundtrack and some magnificent special effects without a doubt a very good film i hope that a sequel comes out
Oct 25 2021,negative,didnt know it was part 1 of 2  very disappointed  will be better able to judge when the second part is released  i will recommend to everyone i know to wait for both parts to be released
Oct 25 2021,positive,i read the novel saw the 1984 movie and saw it also with people who had no clue we all enjoyed it they pay homage to the set piece that is the planet but propelled the story along youre left wanting more but appreciating the world they have setup
Oct 25 2021,positive,the movie was terrific very authentic and stays true to the vision of the book and 10 times better than the original movie the visuals are incredible and i really hope that it earns enough money to warrant a part 2
Oct 25 2021,positive,does a nice job of setting up the rest of the dune story even if some details were off you can never translate a great book onto the screen
Oct 25 2021,positive,i cant remember a flaw the last scene combined with that score was perfection
Oct 25 2021,positive,while a visual feast the lead is bland and sadly unengaging id more likely rewatch lynchs madness or the children of dune miniseries than see this again
Oct 25 2021,positive,tottaly worth it i loved the slow pace of the movie and how the story was told the build of it was perfect    and the sound of this movie was one of a kind
Oct 25 2021,positive,i loved everything about it i really hope part 2 gets made
Oct 25 2021,positive,overall amazing movie visually stunning my only complaint is the sound editing it may of been the imax theater but some of the dialog was hard to hear at times hopefully denis villeneuve is on board for the 2nd movie 
Oct 25 2021,positive,in answer to your question yes go see this movie
Oct 25 2021,positive,well made movie great story nothing wasteful in this presentation of an epic story  watched first on hbo then wanted to see it at imax
Oct 25 2021,positive,this is an excellent show but the fate of part 2 is uncertain if you agree with me rate this movie highly so others will go and see it and part 2 will happen
Oct 25 2021,positive,it was great i loved it
Oct 25 2021,positive,the imagery was exceptional and even as someone who did not read the books i was completely enthralled in the story     amazing
Oct 25 2021,positive,this is an excellent show but the fate of part 2 is uncertain if you agree with me rate this movie highly so others will go and see it and part 2 will happen
Oct 25 2021,positive,transcendent brilliant masterpiece most immersive cinema experience ive had since fellowship of the ring 20 years ago cinematography music special effects acting all a my friends i went with who hadnt read the book were also enthralled by it its not marvel its not star wars dune is its own beast if you go into it with the attitude of wanting to experience something youve never experienced before i dont see how this isnt a feast for any cinema lover if you like michael bay movies you wont like this
Oct 25 2021,positive,my reactions were this is epic loud superb sets some of the best visual effects i have seen  i knew almost nothing about dune going in except futuristic and sandworms and now i am clamoring for part 2 which i hear isnt even greenlit yet  i guess i will have to read the book to find out how everything ends  the score is so unique it is hard to describe  i cant imagine this movie doesnt take oscars home for soundtrack score and effects  and probably costuming and makeup as well  the acting was very good too and the story which is intense is elaborate but i think i understood most of it and am seeking out more online to fill what i dont understand
Oct 25 2021,positive,if youve read the books it is the best trip towards understanding  exceptional
Oct 25 2021,positive,this movie was incredible the acting visuals cinematography sets costumes and score were among the best i have ever seen in any film you have to pay attention to catch everything in a good way it does a great job adapting a book that is very difficult to adapt to film it sets up brilliantly for part 2 and i cannot wait
Oct 25 2021,positive,it is a crime to see this on your tv and think you saw the movie villeneuve completely captured the essence of the book you cannot sense the magnitude of herberts vision from your couch
Oct 25 2021,positive,freaking amazing on all fronts   can the next movie come out right now please   if every person in this movie doesnt get best leadingsupporting actoractress ill be mad as hell
Oct 25 2021,positive,it was absolutely amazing and i hate that we have to wait so long till part 2 warner brothers make sure there is a part 2 please
Oct 25 2021,positive,its been said dune is an unfilmable novel yet villeneuve did better than any other filmmaker could have he enhanced the cinematic elements of the story while including vital points from the book excellent casting breathtaking visuals beautiful score give denis the greenlight for part 2 now
Oct 25 2021,negative,its just very slow and boring story is dull and isnt good at all
Oct 25 2021,positive,great movie i felt the first telling said it very well though
Oct 25 2021,positive,the cast worked well together and was animated the scenes rendered well the sound overall was too loud yet i had trouble hearing some of the dialogue the plot in part one pretty well followed the book   sadly the power went out at the theater as the baron was eating prior to questioning duke leto thus we audience were cut short on the ending of part one was issued a readmission ticket which i hope to use in the next few days
Oct 25 2021,positive,i have loved dune the novel for 40 years and was worried that this film version would be another failed attempt i couldnt have been more surprised and happy to see a beautiful sweeping movie with breathtaking cinematography that so captures the essence of herberts novel my wife and i went to watch it in imax and it was truly awe inspiring thank you denis villeneuve
Oct 25 2021,positive,such a long movie started getting restless and tired overall 610
Oct 25 2021,negative,dry and boring the same as his blade runner 2045  nothing about it stands out or stays with you i feel sorry for those that never read the books and see this version
Oct 25 2021,positive,i love the time taken to set up this epic story the relationship between paul and his parents is excellent i am in awe of the grand scale of what paul is up againist the big and the small and the power they both possess over each other a great film
Oct 25 2021,positive,graphics actors storyline dope  wife loved it too
Oct 25 2021,positive,i have read all 5 books and lets just say this movie does the herberts vision justice wonderfully done it has a dark vibe to it and i really liked it cant wait for part 2

Oct 25 2021,negative,its like the original movie in the 1980s this movie was boring slow and does not make me want to sit through more doom sequels which im sure there will be this is supposed to be science fiction but it is really just a mess
Oct 25 2021,positive,for me it was a bit difficult to follow  did keep you on your toes as to what was gonna happen  good set up for a follow up movie
Oct 25 2021,positive,great movie although its sad to see they havent green lit a part2 yet
Oct 25 2021,negative,it seemed very ambitious early on and i just couldnt get into the story  nice visuals of the desert and javier bardem was excellent but by then i was pinching myself to stay awake
Oct 25 2021,positive,i loved dune it followed the book so closely and was so well done i cant wait until part 2 comes out
Oct 25 2021,negative,horrible we left earlier almost fell asleep the guy next to me chewing popcorn obnoxiously was more entertaining
Oct 25 2021,positive,they finally did it justice i thought the acting was great though some of the characters could have been developed more like the original did imo the imagery was amazing the baron was suitably disturbing i loved the new dr kynes the worms were excellentvery well done overall
Oct 25 2021,positive,great watch part 2 cant come soon enough
Oct 25 2021,positive,this is an absolute masterpiece  the cinematography the sound design the acting everything was spot on  no stranger to the original this one far surpasses it and kept me on the edge of my seat
Oct 25 2021,positive,the characters are unique somehow you will see the other side of star wars
Oct 25 2021,positive,very good movie  lets hope there will be 2ed movie to finish it

Oct 25 2021,positive,unbelievable amazing depiction of the movie
Oct 25 2021,positive,better than the 1985 movie except weve got to wait for part 2
Oct 25 2021,negative,great visual and cinematography but lack of story and slow pace action are underwhelming overall its boring
Oct 25 2021,positive,dune was an amazing film it has been so long since i have seen a movie that left me so excited once leaving the theater the world building was fantastic and made me want to learn more i have never stepped my toes into the waters of the dune universe but after seeing this movie i intend to drive  head first the absolute scale of the universe was huge the scenes were tense the action was beautiful and the acting wonderful i cannot state how much fun this film was and how highly i recommend it
Oct 25 2021,positive,a beast of a film denis villeneuves outdoes himself by creating a complex and coherent world that could potentially be the next franchise of blockbuster films
Oct 25 2021,positive,i hope this makes enough money to get the sequel made i loved it great visuals and interpretation
Oct 25 2021,positive,this was the best movie i watched since the pandemic started and it was so much like the book but still much better than i expected i will certainly watch it again soon
Oct 25 2021,positive,great character development
Oct 25 2021,positive,excellent film took 12 star off because it wasnt as good as some in similar genre many areas were better than others but some were not as good not giving any details go see in imax 100 
Oct 25 2021,positive,amazing movie when was the last time the movie was as good as the book let alone a beloved book like dune  highly recommended

Oct 25 2021,positive,best cinematic version of dune by far
Oct 25 2021,positive,familiar themes but well executed
Oct 25 2021,positive,pure cinema with hypnotic visuals and a haunting soundtrack that show the story rather than overly relying on exposition  the most faithful adaptation overall weaving the books cerebral and timely themes into a compelling pulp scifi film  worth seeing in a theater for the sprawling desert sea vistas and massive sets alone
Oct 25 2021,positive,go see this in the theater so we get a sequel
Oct 25 2021,positive,almost perfect i waited for decades for a version worthy of the book and this one delivered as i hoped for even the little details changed from the book were acceptable in the movie version a true artistic masterpiece i cannot wait for the second part 
Oct 25 2021,positive,dune is a spectacular film with stunning visuals and a story that hardly ever gets lost in its 150minute runtime what makes this film so great is how clear the story is many epics have very complicated stories with overcrowding of heterogeneous elements that hinder the viewing experience yet dune has these complex underlying tones which never make the narrative structure feel cluttered screenwriters jon spaihts denis villeneuve and eric roth do a remarkable job creating the world of dune through some stellar writing the trio also made the film end at the right place in the story it leaves enough adventure for the second film and does not leave the story in the first installment in a weird position the visuals in dune are breathtaking the film achieves this visual status that creates this miraculous vibe throughout the whole duration of the movie director of photography greig fraser deserves several more movies after his work here as of now fraser only has the batman in the future that is guaranteed to change after his cinematography on dune denis villeneuve is a solid director and was the right choice for a film like this villeneuve creates this tone that is grand and dramatic yet still lighthearted at times the cast of dune is one of the most influential highlights of the movie as no actor tarnishes the film timothée chalamet is phenomenal in the leading role not once did his acting appear dry or emotionless rebecca ferguson was stellar as lady jessica the emotion she packed into her performance was so well done oscar isaac was quite monotone throughout his performance but he never brought down any scene where it distracted from what was happening in the plot josh brolin had a lot of excellent line delivery and was very strong when saying relevant lines for instance there is a line where gurney halleck talks about mood and brolin delivers it perfectly sharon duncanbrewster was very strong in the role of dr lietkynes while her character in the film did not end up in a great position duncanbrewster made all the scenes she was in a lot more interesting stellan skarsgård was also particularly strong even with all the prosthetics on his face acting in prosthetics is hard but skarsgård did not disappoint jason momoa added some character to a lot of the scenes as many were very melancholy momoa and chalamet were both great standouts when making the film still feel joyous at times lastly javier bardem and zendaya made such strong impressions in the few scenes they are present the editing is the only aspect of the movie that i would say is hindering dune there are a few scenes where the editing is a bit choppy and sometimes the flow between sequences is not perfect however the score from hans zimmer is strong pauls dream is comprehensive as it helps set the mood for arrakis however a minor nitpick with the score would be that some tracks needed more consistency so the whole soundtrack would connect dune is a phenomenal film that consists of showstopping visuals and a marvelous cast with timothée chalamet and rebecca ferguson taking the reins of much of the movie there is no way the film gets boring or dragged out while there are trivial things like the editing and minor explanation problems dune hides those aspects with its impressive cinematography dune faithfully lives up to the epic nature that it promises read more reviews like this at postcreditreviewscom
Oct 25 2021,positive,amazing story telling amazing cast cant wait till the next chapter
Oct 25 2021,positive,it only makes up half of the first book but dune is a spectacle and further exemplifies why we need theaters
Oct 25 2021,positive,a slow burn for sure and most definitely half of the story it says part one but it is one of the most beautifully shot movies ive seen in awhile and all of the performances are top tier villenueve is fantastic as always and really did an incredible job of adapting the novel
Oct 25 2021,positive,not a bad adaptation from the book visually remarkable
Oct 25 2021,positive,movie was visually stunning characters were very compelling cant wait for part two
Oct 25 2021,positive,it was a different take on the dune saga not a bad one but not one i would watch again ill need to see the second part to make a full opinion
Oct 25 2021,positive,dreams are messages from the deep    just let the small negatives out of the way first some parts were a bit slow and characters murmured a lot so i couldnt hear some lines also its quite a bit of info into the universe    now thats done i first want to say that dune part i was a cinematic masterpiece almost every single scene was handled masterfully with cinematography that blessed my eyes never have i seen the desert this beautiful and dreamy it was so breathtaking that i might suffocate     not only that the unbelievable scores from hans zimmer created an immersive atmosphere i have been listening to pauls dream and ripples in the sand for about 3 months now and i just could not get tired of them they sounded just as good and even better in the theater     the characters looked amazing as well the suits that oscar isaac and timothee chamalet wore were so classy as well as the other designs there were an absurd amount of close ups of characters face and each one of them was beautiful especially the fremen with their blue eyes    since this was only part i the plot wasnt complete but it showed great potential for an actionpacked cinematic party  as said by denis villeneuve     overall probably the best looking film i have seen in a long long time please watch it in imax the imax that i watched in was a bit ghetto to absorb all the beauty 9510
Oct 25 2021,positive,almost the exact story and script to the first movie but very good however i think younger audiences will not understand it also a little disappointed that it is s 2 parter
Oct 25 2021,positive,loved this movie great beginning good character development cants wait for the next installment
Oct 25 2021,positive,absolutely loved the storytelling and the acting in this gorgeous film are incredible must see for all scifi fans and beyond
Oct 25 2021,neutral,  2021 action adventure drama  pg13  25 out of 5 stars    dune has long been considered an unfilmable work and honestly after watching this i may have to agree to be fair ive never seen the 1984 version by david lynch although i do own it so i need to get on that previously the film was in preproduction by the director alejandro jodorowsky this was such an infamous achievement that an entire documentary has been made just on the work he had put into a film that was never made    in the leadup to this new version many comparisons to star wars have been made in the marketing as far as i can tell the closest to star wars that this comes is that its in space has aliens and involves spice other than that this is very much a creature of its own and a derivative work at that director denis villeneuve blade runner 2049 sicario built this world packed full of many compelling images and yet in my opinion forgot to include any substance i feel like part of this could be since he spends most of the two hours and thirtyfiveminute runtime building these worlds i get the importance of this but in a film that is the first of a proposed trilogy of films he has to remember that hooking the audience is more critical than creating another world in the future    i gave this a 255 because thats where i felt after the film i didnt love it and i didnt hate it i left feeling that i was in the middle of the road without much understanding of where to go from there i will still watch the following two films because i feel invested however i doubt ill fall for villeneuves marketing the next time he was quoted as saying watching dune on a tv is like driving a speedboat in your bathtub im a huge fan of movie theaters and while this did offer some spectacular visuals i dont feel that it was as important as i thought to watch it on the big screen im not saying you shouldnt but i also dont think most will appreciate it to that extent    overall id say the film had a great score vast and impressive set pieces a lot of filler and little substance it is a 2 hour and 35minute film that felt all four hours while watching it so as you can see i was left not being sure how to best rate it my experience wasnt the greatest but i can see the potential and am excited at the thought of what this universe can be     as always please dont take my word for it i only share my feelings and thoughts on these films if you love something that i hated then your opinion on it is valid if you hated a movie i loved again you are entitled to that opinion ive said it before and ill repeat it my favorite part of film is that two people can watch it and have two entirely different experiences    for the fun of it i rewatched villeneuves blade runner 2049 as part of my project watching all of the films set in the alienpredator universe yes blade runner is there check out my social media to find out how i adore this film it had so much heart and just the right amount of nostalgia from the original blade runner film    im very much looking forward to last night in soho although i feel that it may not be able to live up to what ive built it up in my mind    where to watch  available on hbo max and in theaters now    for more reviews and my new youtube channel please visit linktreeoverlyhonestmoviereviews    im always happy to hear from my readers please say hi or send me any questions about all things movies    dune timotheechalamet frankherbert timoth dunemovie callmebyyourname inktober cmbyn littlewomen ladybird denisvilleneuve arrakis beautifulboy zendaya theking scifi timothee thefrenchdispatch hotsummernights echalamet duna chalamet tchalamet jasonmomoa timotheechalametedit liltimmytim timmy missstevens art
Oct 25 2021,positive,if you have never read the book or seen the original movie this will be boring visually entertaining but the whole thing could have been summed up in 30 minutes they drew this movie out way too long
Oct 25 2021,positive,part 1 was fine if a little slow part 2 is really going to determine whether part 1 was worth watching mightve been a little more effective if it ended on a harder cliffhanger if you saw the original or read the book that spot could have been had not too much further into the story
Oct 25 2021,positive,masterfully shot powerfully acted and highly ambitious denis villeneuves adaption of frank herberts classic novel is an adaptation done right dune is a sci fi epic to end all sci fi epics 
Oct 25 2021,positive,only thing i disliked was i did not know it was a twopart movie
Oct 25 2021,positive,great visual story telling ive read the book but i feel like those who havent would still love this movie
Oct 25 2021,positive,loved it villaneuves genius continues to be his pacing not just his incredible ability to invent new soundscapes worlds and people for us to be immersed in which we all know hes very gifted at his genius at dancing back and forth between showing  telling at exactly the right moments keeps the viewer engrossed then appropriately perplexed then theres a satisfying revelation or tease towards one then youre engrossed again and around we go this is masterful direction at its finest i was fully ready to hunker down for another 3 hours when the credits rolled     another thing he did and did better than almost anyone else i can think of in the last 20 years  is he led us with the wouldbe messianic figure in his gradual selfawakening rather than pacing us ahead of him as the viewer thats very very hard to do i hate to be too on the nose but villaneuve was nearly shakespearian in his invocation of an apprehensive hero that the audience joins in his apprehension and selfdoubt this is no neo wherein were all winking at each other in wait no offense to one of my favorite scifi movies even those who know what will happen  know pauls fate will be paced alongside pauls understated disbelief and reservations as he becomes more and more selfaware to be honest even at the end of the film i still wondered what he thought of himself and thats great filmmaking cannot wait for the next one
Oct 25 2021,positive,outstanding an absolute masterpiece  i remember seeing the one from 84 and was very underwhelmed by it as a teen but this remake is a visual and storytelling epic one of the best sci fi i seen in a long time i cant wait for part 2
Oct 25 2021,positive,i really went into this not expecting to like it its subtle draw and character portrayal hooked me into watching it from a fresh point of view it really was a very good interpretation of the source materialcant wait for part two
Oct 25 2021,positive,its somewhat slow moving deliberately i think but its faithful to the books and must better than david lynchs version the cast is outstanding and cinematography spectacular definitely worth seeing on the big screen
Oct 25 2021,positive,overall a visually dazzling film that can sometimes be hard to follow due to the elements that only exist in this particular world the pacing is good as well as the acting and story true sci fi fans will love this but if you are not into sci fi you may be lost in much of the dialogue and dense layers of the story
Oct 25 2021,positive,liked the story line development and the acting
Oct 25 2021,positive,it engages your senses while it touches your heart a gripping film that is epic in every respect yes it ends in the middle of the story but id rather be left wanting more than hoping it would end
Oct 25 2021,negative,the first movie ive had to order coffee in a theater to help stay awake movie was far too slow the best part was when mimoa died
Oct 25 2021,positive,part 1 of an unfinished masterpiece
Oct 25 2021,positive,didnt really live up to the expectations
Oct 25 2021,positive,dune was a good film  the only thing is that it is a multi part film and i didnt find out until attending the film
Oct 25 2021,positive,there is so much to say first off see it in the theater if you can its worth it i applaud denis villanueves vision  ambition its a big movie it took me a little while to warm up to timothy chalamet sp but once i did i thought he was fabulous having read the book i had no concept of how they would get all that on screen but they made some really smart cinematic choices if you like scifi if you enjoyed star wars or avatar go see dune first chance you get
Oct 25 2021,positive,great and highly recommend for anyone imax is best for viewing by far
Oct 25 2021,neutral,visual engaging and ambitiously beautiful dunes weak and messy story doesnt allow this movie to reach its full potential theres moments you feel amazed and others you feel bored specially when it looks like a mere powerpoint with beautiful pictures  except from stellan there isnt a single drop of good or impactful acting just a few replaceable heads on a suit and timothée chalamet dull and barf face acting makes it even more difficult to watch
Oct 25 2021,positive,incredible scale  a work of art
Oct 25 2021,positive,ive been a fan of herberts masterpiece since the 80s this movie far exceeded my wildest expectations a thousand stars are not enough for this movie
Oct 25 2021,negative,too long especially for just part 1
Oct 25 2021,positive,excellent  cannot wait for part 2  shown the way frank herbert would have wanted
Oct 25 2021,positive,i like the graphics it is going to be a great series good story and a fresh breath of something different
Oct 25 2021,positive,amazing movie the only thing i didnt like was that it ended seriously though they need to make more movies to finish the story exceeded my expectations
Oct 25 2021,positive,its big and goodlooking  scenery set design ornithopters  and really wellcast chalamet masters the look of a byronic hero but neither he nor anyone else has much to say i still have a place in my heart for the colorful madness of the david lynch version they better make a sequel and it better challenge the white savior myth  esp with all the islamic references that are straight from the book
Oct 25 2021,positive,spectacular adaptation of the original book epic visuals and great mood setting soundtrack hopefully they make part 2 i really hope this sets up a whole new universe and multiple movie series
Oct 25 2021,positive,close to perfect movie impressive cast beautiful music original and loyal depictions from the book loved each minute
Oct 25 2021,positive,this isnt dune per se its only the first portion  half third who knows i wish id known that going in the way they cut it off building building building then cut it off with no climax its the movie version of blue balls dont get me wrong its really well done however calling this dune and saying theyre hoping to do a sequel all going well is frustrating
Oct 25 2021,negative,i was so hopeful this new version would redeem the debacle from my youth that so horribly depicted this literary masterpiece on the big screen  somehow the failure vortex sucked the new filmmakers into what had been made prior and had them exacerbate the trauma of watching it by extension to two films    i would so love to slap the everliving shit out of them for principles sake privileged arrogant tarts should not be allowed access to art
Oct 25 2021,positive,likes this a lot cant wait to see part 2
Oct 25 2021,positive,phenomenal it has been a decade since i have seen something so well done  my 11 year old daughter didnt  want it to endand neither did i fastest 25 hour movie i have ever seen first theater experience since covid and wow what a show please make part 2 3 4
Oct 25 2021,positive,a lot of hype but doesnt stand out as anything special  its only part one but isnt a difficult story to follow at this point so didnt need to be so long
Oct 25 2021,positive,very well done cinematography saw in xd format so was epic and its size nice to see it more back to some of the context of the book cant wait for part two
Oct 25 2021,positive,i cannot iversell this movie it is the best boomrofilm epic weve had in ages  if not the single best this is a peter jacksons lord of the rings level epic and will be this generations great series
Oct 25 2021,positive,great special effects and cinematography good acting and an intriguing story line that made this two and a half hour movie just fly by and leave you wanting more
Oct 25 2021,positive,its an embodiment of magnificence a work of pure art  i could not express how entertained i am by this masterpiece of work  it gave an experience that we all were longing for too long  thank you thank you thank you to every single creature that contributed to the making of this gift
Oct 25 2021,positive,an epic with stunning cinematography and a powerful cast
Oct 25 2021,positive,loved it sound design perfect acting is excellent bravo denis villeneuve
Oct 25 2021,positive,incredible   must see at an imax
Oct 25 2021,positive,not a bad film you are a little lost as there is so much baggage  background from the book simplified also it is only part one if you arent already a fan of dune stay a trip and collect the whole series in a few years
Oct 25 2021,positive,the movie is very good  i loved the cinematography special effects scenery and the brooding moodiness of the film  i had seen the 1984 dune and had an idea of what to expect  this version is sooo much better
Oct 24 2021,positive,while its only the first part hopefully there will be a sequel based on a vast book it is definitely everything that frank herbert probably wouldve wanted as denis villeneuve does a lot in not just worldbuilding and setting up themes but also bring a lot of depth to the characters as well as others to come
Oct 24 2021,positive,what a beautiful and tastefully done adaptation of the book the artistry in this film is clear
Oct 24 2021,positive,what an amazing movie from start to finish extremely beautiful and the sounds and music coming from the theater speakers blew me away what a performance
Oct 24 2021,positive,as powerful as it is compelling dune part 1 opens the audiences eyes to its massive and deep new world at precisely the right pace to build into the scope of its characters and storys magnitude
Oct 24 2021,positive,great but i had already read the book
Oct 24 2021,positive,as someone who has read the book i thought this was an absolute wonderful adaptation it captured most of the plot points in the book while adding to the scale and imagination most readers experienced in the book
Oct 24 2021,positive,boring i left after an hour 1984 film version and books both a lot better
Oct 24 2021,positive,the setting and world building are amazing for a new start to something more i hope this movie succeeds and we can get a conclusion to this story
Oct 24 2021,positive,having never seen or read any of the other dune adaptations i can safely say that denis villeneuves 2021 adaptation of dune is exactly what i expected and what i expected was good  the cinematography is gorgeous the designs ill have a quality that is both familiar and foreign at the same time the acting from everyone onscreen is great and hans zimmers score is just as engrossing as it always is  its just that almost everything i expected to be bad about the film was just as bad as i thought it would be the pacing is way too slow at times as charming as the actors were the characters that they were portraying were bland as hell and it tricked the audience within the first minute of the film surprising them with the knowledge that this was a part one instantly setting their expectations lower knowing theyd only see at least half of a story  its still a good film overall dont get me wrong but its not perfect and i dont think its the masterpiece that most fans of the original book are anticipating it to be and as for normal moviegoersits a surprise part one really
Oct 24 2021,positive,one of the best scifi movies ive ever seen dune starts a little slow as it sets up frank herberts dynamic and complicated universe however it quickly finds its lightningfast pace and never looks back the performances from dunes starstudded cast and hans zimmers tremendous score do an amazing job entrenching the audience in this story this movie is a mustsee for anyone even semiinterested in the scifi genre my main recommendation see it on the biggest screen possible
Oct 24 2021,negative,the best thing that can be said is that it met the very very low bar of being better than the last dune movie  that being said the pace was slow and familiarity with the book was the only thing that allowed comprehension of the important nuances of the plot   friends who saw it and had not read the book felt very lost due to lack of backstory     special effects are better than average    finally the first clue i had that this was intended to be a multipart and who knows how many they plan was a very subtle pare one shown once on the title frame
Oct 24 2021,positive,it is visually very stunning and the story is intriguing  the problem with this movie was pacing  i felt like inbetween it was stalling for time so they could justify a part two
Oct 24 2021,positive,i triumph an ode to frank herbert and hardcore fans i can understand the struggle of some viewers but the movie is hands down a masterpiece of a masterpiece
Oct 24 2021,positive,good movie i like how it didnt try to over pack the story by adding this appending war into this film
Oct 24 2021,positive,filmmaking at its finest a true cinematic sci fi masterpiece
Oct 24 2021,positive,gorgeous  great cast and cant wait for part two
Oct 24 2021,positive,great movie cant wait for part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,excellent would have liked to know it was only 1 out of 3 parts  great special effects  very good acting
Oct 24 2021,positive,great scifi movie cant wait for part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,as a long dune fan i never thought anyone could bring herberts vision to the screen and the 1984 david lynch version doesnt count but denis villeneuve had delivered the casting is spoton and it is a sumptuous visual treat    my only issue is that its only half of the story so i will be eagerly awaiting part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,slow and tedious friends who read the books loved it the film should stand on its own without knowledge of the book this movie felt contrived
Oct 24 2021,neutral,it was a really good story line  too many dark fuzzy parts was very sad to see they havent even determined weather to do part 2 yet and if they do wont be out until 2023
Oct 24 2021,positive,a masterpiece visually impressive and a very good adaptation of the herberts story
Oct 24 2021,positive,excellent production and special effects and good performances  i do wish they wouldnt whisper so much however  overall  very entertaining and worth the watch
Oct 24 2021,positive,the best of the 3 attempts to adapt dune to the screen this effort comes closest to capturing herberts vision the acting and the visuals are terrific looking forward to part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,the only thing this movie left me wanting was more
Oct 24 2021,positive,this movie was made for 4dx total masterpiece only con is its a hard plot to follow if you dont have any prior exposure to dune
Oct 24 2021,positive,ive never read the book never saw the previous movie of dune but fully understood and grasp the movie great film though it did feel like it ended abruptly the visuals were stunning and i loved the score
Oct 24 2021,positive,great movie with outstanding movie score and costumes
Oct 24 2021,positive,im an great dune fan and this movie was just perfect in all de segments like audio designfigurine and script i cant wait for the part two
Oct 24 2021,positive,i like the production story line actirs
Oct 24 2021,positive,great cinematography followed the book for the most part
Oct 24 2021,positive,amazing sci fi epic some might say it is slow at times but you are able to get totally immersed in the dune universe great story and acting brilliant design i cannot wait for part 2 which i know will be action heavy great novel too
Oct 24 2021,neutral,there are better ways to waste your time and money but if you are absolutely bored and a fan of the main actor then maybe youll be able to endure this 
Oct 24 2021,positive,great adaptation visuals are fantastic and the casting is on point
Oct 24 2021,positive,great movie but didnt know it was only part 1
Oct 24 2021,negative,good cgi but this movie was awful slow and nonsensical 
Oct 24 2021,positive,visually stunning i enjoyed the pacing and the adaptation i know the reviews have been mixed but i believe in a world and generation of instant gratification a proper slow burn like this done masterfully is good for the soul
Oct 24 2021,positive,really keeps you invested and on your toes
Oct 24 2021,positive,i watched this movie after seeing a few initial negative reviews  as a fan of the original i was prepared to be disappointed  now after seeing the movie my biggest question is who were the fools who wrote the initial negative review  this movie in being remade deserved to be made in an epic scope and fashion  i believe this has been accomplished and i was completely immersed in the tale  even after having read the books albeit many years ago and watched the original several times  the actors portrayal of the characters was excellent bringing new scope and completeness to each of the main roles  the cinematography is outstanding  i really enjoyed the film  i would say that i loved it but since there is a part two in the future i feel as if ive had an excellent first date and i can see myself falling in love after a little more time together  i will be keeping my ear to the ground for a date of release in regard to the conclusion of this excellent story  i highly recommend the film
Oct 24 2021,positive,awesome movie loved the story
Oct 24 2021,negative,worst movie ive ever seen in 50 years on this earth horrible plot line weird side stories so so special effects 20 minutes in and couldnt wait for the movie to be over could have put more into the reason for mining the spice huge desert yet only one machine mining plenty of desert to go around how anyone gave this movie a higher rating is beyond me
Oct 24 2021,positive,this was awesome the only problem with it is that part 2 isnt even filming yet ugh need part 2 asap
Oct 24 2021,positive,denis villeneuve is one of the best directors nowadays and this is another masterpiece from him
Oct 24 2021,positive,finally brought to life the right way sickest part of movie is the music sounds like a language all its own zimmer the master all star cast looking forward to next episodes not all out action has to lay the story line 1st 45 start to me wont let me add half star
Oct 24 2021,positive,incredible story telling and cinematography a must see
Oct 24 2021,positive,premise ive read the book 3 times the movie is mesmerising like the pages of the book coming to life i felt that i wanted to watch it in slow motion to slow things down and absorb every detaili will be watching it again
Oct 24 2021,negative,if you havent read the book or seen the other 2 movies you will have no idea what is going on critical story elements and character background missing
Oct 24 2021,negative,honestly i found the movie to be more of an excuse for special effects was kind of bored the whole time
Oct 24 2021,positive,the movie is very dark and its hard to see otherwise it was great
Oct 24 2021,positive,a long epic and beautiful movie definitely not for everyone but i personally loved it
Oct 24 2021,positive,awesome cant wait for the next one
Oct 24 2021,positive,personally i thought the movie was as well done as it could be there were moments when certain unimportant scenes dragged on too long but aside from that great movie cannot wait for the next one
Oct 24 2021,positive,loved everything about this movie hauntingly beautiful visuals and amazing music i really liked the pacing of the story it wasnt rushed time was taken to give this epic story the telling that it deserves
Oct 24 2021,positive,i loved every minute of it yes it was a bit slow at points but there was character development great effects and mesmerizing desert scenes
Oct 24 2021,negative,the acting was wooden the direction formulaic and the special effects were not all that special
Oct 24 2021,positive,absolutely incredible take on the amazing novel much of what it leaves out is not missed while it stays surprisingly true to what is left    beyond that the production value is simply off the charts  virtually any still could be framed and proudly displayed and the audio is incredible    highly recommended
Oct 24 2021,positive,dune part one of however many movies this director wants to make was excellent it took the edgy dark house harkonen from the earlier film and book source material and gave it a reasonable if not militant bent house atriedes was the more noble house given to exploration for the purpose of installing a livable system for all i would assume was supposed to parallel many civilized settled citizenry then there was house ordos which to be honest i did not see represented much in this part one treatment of the story admittedly im no expert of the dune lore yet i left the cinema wanting more and loving what i got it has been a long time since i have been honestly excited for a story sure godzilla vs king kong was a cinematic smashfest that i loved it tapped into the 8 year old boy inside of me dune only the flip side left me exhausted overheated and longing for the rest of the story as paul harvey used to say if you know dune you know the parallels with today i say pay no attention to the parallels and just enjoy the cinema it has scope alright i finally think i found a reason to reserve a seat now
Oct 24 2021,positive,amazing beautifully filmed great acting  i loved every minute  the sound effects were amazing  totally worth the extra money for imax on this one i loved the duke
Oct 24 2021,positive,great plot settings soundtrack and characters only thing i didnt like was the difficulty of understanding their speech speech was gargled and it needed subtitles
Oct 24 2021,positive,overall awesome some places really really needed subtitles very much want to watch part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,i liked the storyline and the cinematography beautiful excited for the next one
Oct 24 2021,positive,incredible everyone go to the biggest screen you can find and watch this movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,as a reader of the book and fan of the original movie  this movie was amazing up until the point where they decided to split the movie it wasnt a clean break by any means but certainly leaves me wanting more for the horrible split i am deducting a half of star
Oct 24 2021,positive,loved it better than the 1984 version and not one eye roll
Oct 24 2021,positive,while it may be a lot to digest for the uninitiated it is well worth the effort
Oct 24 2021,positive,the director did a fantastic job of displaying the deep story of the book to the audience superb casting astounding visuals and utterly perfect execution job well done  jr
Oct 24 2021,positive,magnificent film one of the best of the years amazing visual effects cinematography directing and performances all throughout slow pace in the first act may lose a few of you but those who can maintain through the pace and understand the world will be satisfied on where the story is going
Oct 24 2021,negative,snore fest watched it twice just to make sure just what we need is another white savior the only actors that were allowed to do their job were josh brolin jason mamoa oscar issac stellan skarsgård javier bardem dave bautista and sharon duncanbrewster all the rest gave twodimensional cardboard performances in plain costumes with the worst background music ultimately did we really need another dune movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,great storytelling  stunning visuals  engaging and honest acting choices  i am so ready for part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,fastmoving looking forward to next one
Oct 24 2021,positive,dune is absolutely one of the best movies ive watched in years the adaptation is extremely faithful to the book and thats wonderful and unique  every audio visual work of the film is perfect and well done worthy of oscar duna deserves a sequel and maybe go even further with the other books    the lack of politics really sinned in dune as there is a lot of that in dune some cut scenes that were missed other than that the movie is perfect acting soundtrack script
Oct 24 2021,positive,dune 2021 is a good movie dont drink the koolaid its not great the acting is kinda emotionally dry its a little better than the 1984 version
Oct 24 2021,positive,best all around movie since jojo rabbit
Oct 24 2021,positive,the special effects were awesome and the storyline was true to the original story a must see
Oct 24 2021,neutral,visually fantastic isaacs brolin skarsgaard and bautista were great for their roles mixed on chalemet and fergesun im good about the gender switch of liet kynes not sure if aquadrogo was miscast or that he was just written poorly most of the script was written poorly dialogue atrocious the good actors couldnt make it work
Oct 24 2021,positive,highly recommend in 3d on a giant screen  its beautiful  asl a very good adaption of the text  great casting  they better hurry up with part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,cinematography visuals and cast were amazing however the pacing was just too slow the third and last acts got really boring but i really loved how beautifully the dessert was captured only worth watching in imax and in a dolby theater
Oct 24 2021,positive,fantastic best scifi movie in a long time wish they kept some parts from the book setting up a twist but it worked
Oct 24 2021,positive,everything about this movie is phenomenal the costume design is incredible the score builds massive swings in tension timothee chamlets brooding personality fits paul atreides perfectly and the rest of the cast shines as well so much care was put in to staying accurate to the books this movie is a masterpiece
Oct 24 2021,negative,i didnt read the book but still thought i might enjoy the movie i was wrong it was so long and slow and painful to watch if my other half hadnt wanted to stay i would have left 30 minutes in  the plot was confusing to the point to where i gave up trying to figure it out  despite being slow and lame the movie took itself very seriously like it was star wars or something its not
Oct 24 2021,positive,solid plot loved the special effects and of course all of the action
Oct 24 2021,positive,i thought it was a good movie the pacing is better than people said it was i felt connected to the characters the visual scope is incredible it felt like a new hope to me im excited for the pail atriedes saga
Oct 24 2021,positive,good effects photography actors  i didnt expect to have half of the story though this is just part 1    cinemark 19 in katy should have better sound 
Oct 24 2021,positive,unbelievable film across the board easily the best in 2021
Oct 24 2021,positive,outstanding modern interpretation of the greatest science fiction novel of all time  loved it  sound editing will win an oscar  cant wait for part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,true to the book without being a slave to it action tempered with character development and strong acting
Oct 24 2021,positive,every scene is gorgeous
Oct 24 2021,negative,boring drags on and on and is confusing even after reading the book  there is no heart and soul to the movie just a bunch of drawn out battle scenes  only go if you set your expectations low
Oct 24 2021,positive,better then the 84 release
Oct 24 2021,positive,so glad saw it on imax then went home again to watch it great story great effects 
Oct 24 2021,positive,um wow watched this on hbomax but this has to be absolutely stunning on a big screen its gorgeous to look at phenomenal cast im a dune newbie but watched it with a true fan my dad and we both loved it    it was surreal and cerebral with an absolutely epic feel to it within the first 10 minutes i felt like i was in an epic  akin to lotr sw or got but with dune there was none of the tedious rampup time that these classics had it builds things up with a mix of intrigue danger and wonder consider me a fan now
Oct 24 2021,positive,awesome  loved it  the books were at once vast and intimate and villeneuve captured this tonespiritpace beautifully  casting was spot on
Oct 24 2021,positive,me and family watched it on hbo and absolutely loved the movie a 
Oct 24 2021,positive,gorgeous movie cant wait to see more of this lore same director hopefully way more subtle and refreshing than star wars tbh love it made for the big screen
Oct 24 2021,positive,i liked the portrait of the beginnings of an epic tale but i was disappointed that it was the teaser for the next film
Oct 24 2021,negative,slow no meaning sucked
Oct 24 2021,negative,very slow and then it ends wast of time 
Oct 24 2021,positive,epic cant wait till part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,a stunning visual experience with amazing audio qualities chalamet and ferguson lead a cast of magnificent performances in this scifi epic a complex fascinating adventure one that will leave you eager for denis villeneuve to make part two
Oct 24 2021,positive,i am not sure about dune it is a visual treat from villeneuve first and foremost it is also long and quite clearly concealing its cards closest to its chest and saving better things for the sequels with no real knowledge of the source material the plot has few major problems if any it can afford to have lulls due to the projects scope and the necessity of the audience to bed into the films world hans zimmer undertaking a score that he felt a close personal connection to per his own words and a composer who i would put among the best working today did not always do it for me some of the bombastic sound effects although certainly otherworldly and unique distracted from events and camera shots in a strange disconnect nearly tumbling proceedings onto the concerning edge of ridiculous i liked the performances chalamet and ferguson dont exactly work as mother and son but both of them are good if lacking a few real standout moments as the two characters with the most time to shine oscar isaac is typically splendid and i would say that stellen skarsgards character is perfectly realised and suitably bloodcurdling a lot of wellknown actors are also in this and as one would surmise i had few complaints  villeneuve has delivered a singular cinematic experience deserving credit for ambition alone although it does not lack at all in other categories
Oct 24 2021,positive,wonderful thought it was better than the original cannot wait for part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,with its sheer spectacle and absolutely confident storytelling the film is a gift for both fans and general moviegoers there is so much to love here a grandiose story that is told with such dedication visual flair and craftsmanship
Oct 24 2021,positive,visually beautiful true to the story cant wait for the next film
Oct 24 2021,neutral,its better than david lynchs but even half the book still defeats what movies can do  yes yes its visually grand but villeneuve practices the bad habit of pointless action that grinds on for nothing and conveys nothing how long is paul going to spend crashing that bird  who is fighting whom during the big big battle  do i need a dune thats spends a third of its time looking like a middling james bond the sound track mistakes noise and mumbojumbo for mysticism  chalamet is certainly better than kyle maclachlan for paul jason momoa is fantastic as duncan idaho  hes a highlight  rebecca ferguson is as about as mysterious as a jv cheerleader  with ten episodes and the budget of game of thrones you might make a successful limited series from dune  otherwise please just stop
Oct 24 2021,positive,simply astonishing dune visualizes and evokes a sublime and thoughtful story in a fullyrealized universe the characters are portrayed beautifully and some even better than they were on the pageim looking at you timothee chalamet everybody played their roles to perfection rebecca ferguson as lady jessica was interesting and 3 dimensional jason momoa as duncan idaho was a charismatic and loveable soldier oscar isaac as the duke was staunch and conservative stellan skarsgaard as the barron was terrifying and glutinous i think you get the point that everyone was perfectly cast    the score was one to remember arguably the best hanz zimmer has ever crafted sometimes its bombastic and epic in others its strange and eerie but it always hold a sense of gravitous that is not easily conjured     did i mention the special effects were out of this world dennis had a vision and the cinematographers costume designers and visual effects crew were in on it too dune has been referred to as the unfilmmable scifi epicdennis and crew wanted to change that and they did     some will say that the endpoint didnt feel like an actual ending but more of an intermission for the sequel and while i understand where theyre coming from i believe the writers and dennis did the best they could to end part 1 how they thought it shouldve ended     this is a masterpiece dont let anyone tell you otherwise this is the science fiction epic of a life timenot star wars this will be a movie that we talk about and reference to for years to come    this is dune this is a masterpiece and it should be treated as such
Oct 24 2021,positive,fantastic this was a faithful representation of the book the only downside was that they stopped in the middle of the first book i would have gladly stayed another 2 and a half hours for the finish
Oct 24 2021,positive,excellent cinematography and a fairly consistent rendition from what i remember from the book  it could have used a bit more character development but i did not feel it was at all soulless like another review i read
Oct 24 2021,positive,maybe not enough character development to really care whats happening to our protagonist but beautifully shot and decently paced driving score too with nonstandard instrumentation and vocals  great effort put in to make this seem like a whole other world
Oct 24 2021,negative,long slow confusing such a weak story we were losing our minds and tempted to walk out
Oct 24 2021,positive,as others have said slow building but if you are familiar with the material worth it 
Oct 24 2021,negative,boring afso long my bf fell asleepdont go
Oct 24 2021,negative,this movie dragged on   i fell asleep for 30 minutes  missed nothing   at the very begining of the movie they flash part 1  i dont know  how many parts there are  but  there wasnt any  suspense or ending  just a set up for a contuniuation of this  movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,although a bit tedious at times dune is well worth a watch the cinematography and score drive the film as it is visually stunning and foreboding the films biggest downfall is that its meant to be told in two parts without a confirmed sequel it leaves the viewer with a story books aside left open ended far be it from me to discount the cinema but i opted to view the film on hbo max in my opinion the film wouldve been far less enjoyable in theatres the ability for the viewer to pause and go back is a godsend when watching a movie where some lines are near inaudible being able to utilize sub titles to assist with parts of the film where the dialogue is low is also a tremendous benefit
Oct 24 2021,positive,dune gives you everything the cinematic experience was meant for a visual masterpiece that immerses you in another world with a stellar cast and engaging story a beautiful epic that needs to be finished
Oct 24 2021,positive,a slow burn let yourself get immersed into the world of the movie and the masterful soundtrack cinematography directing acting and visuals this is denis at the peak of his craft passion oozes from every frame of this film im ecstatic for a part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,amazing instant classic
Oct 24 2021,positive,opening weekend i saw this twice both times in imax finally justice had been done with this masterpiece the cast was stupendouswith everyone contributing just enough as appropriate no overacting powerful score by hans zimmer epic scope and cinematography seems simple but i was so impressed with how reallooming the ornithopter design is now i reallyreallyreally hope part 2 gets greenlit
Oct 24 2021,positive,good long enjoyed it
Oct 24 2021,negative,its just copy and paste of other movies ive seen
Oct 24 2021,positive,great film and great visuals
Oct 24 2021,positive,majestic and visually stunning the film does well in capturing the mood and subtleties of the dune universe but the middling scripting and uneven acting detract from what will define this new legacy meant to erase the memory of the david lynch debacle admittedly i was hoping for something more along the lines of game of thrones with a high language in harmony with frank herberts social commentary and exposition of political subterfuge the beautifully crafted visuals gritty cityscapes and intricate machinery of the dune world set upon a poignant hans zimmer sound track at least make up significant ground lost by the poor writing    the screenplay uses herberts eloquence sparingly and effectively but for those who know the novel it is glaringly clear when additional dialogue or narrative voice overs are interjected to fill the inbetween spaces with hollywood filler the film is a reminder that poorly read millennials will speak for the future of 10000 ad creating such jarring colloquialisms as when the protagonist paul asks his mother jessica before entering into the desert surf you good forgetting to add dude to the end of the sentence then as they emerge from the storm jessica a high courtier to the duke leto exclaims that was insane also forgetting to add dude many moments leave us wishing that things were just left unsaid for example when paul explains its all your fault i am a freak we get it and you dont need to belabor the point rick james    given the weakness of the writing the director wisely chooses to let the visuals do the heavy lifting but this strains timothée chalamet and rebecca ferguson to use their screen presence to carry the gravitas of the film they are not equipped to do leading to over acting at key pointseg jessicas half smile when told paul could be the kwisatz haderach confusing the audience for a second as to whether she is an eminent member of the bene gesserit with intricate selfcontrol over their emotional presence or a freshman who just found out she was selected to the sorority of her choice after a long rush week     the producers insightfully chose scenes well suited to the screen and limited the film to covering only the first third of the novel avoiding the challenges that david lynch faced in trying to tell the whole story at once converting the first dune novel into a multipart series provides more breathing room and profitability similar to how pierce brown retracted the movie rights to red rising in favor of a more thoughtfully developed television series yet the pacing of the film is too slow not because of the limited material but because the director chose to use voice overs to jump start the narrative so more time could be spent on overly long shots of space ships flying around thoughtful dialog could have been paired with these scenes to develop the characters or push the narrative forward but this was unfortunately absent for much of the film     fans and studio execs need not worry that this will be an ignominious flop with the laughable pixilated body shields the 1984 dune but the film is far from being a revolution in cinema that dune represented for science fiction
Oct 24 2021,positive,there were some slow parts but over all it was a great movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,spectacular movie with amazing sound design does the book justice
Oct 24 2021,positive,good for scifi buffs  character and plot development moves pretty fast might be good to read a some background material on the movie 1st  some dialogue is hard the hear  looking forward to part 2
Oct 24 2021,negative,shit movie hard to follow what exactly is going on from start to finish  nothing really happens in the movie
Oct 24 2021,neutral,two and a half hours for half of a movie its just pointless
Oct 24 2021,positive,amazing cinematography storytelling and music fantastic cast and boy that story 
Oct 24 2021,positive,amazing visuals the size and scope of the technology and creatures were stunning the ship designs were jaw dropping i definitely enjoyed seeing this come to life on the big screen truly epic in scale
Oct 24 2021,positive,i think this was a good start to something great  dune has a talented cast that really helps bring the characters and world into existence  mostly great acting and the action sequences kept me at the edge of my seat  i admittedly havent seen the old adaptation or read the books  i went into it without being spoiled in any way so a lot of the big plot twists etc all came as a surprise to me  i would and will recommend this movie
Oct 24 2021,negative,i had no idea what was going on i only went to see zendaya
Oct 24 2021,positive,coolest scifi movie ive seen in long time suspense action supernatural amazing cinematography and score the coolest tech spaceships acting and spiritual powers we want to go back and watch again lol
Oct 24 2021,positive,i liked very much that it was authentically consistent with the book  having this spread over two parts is also good because it gives the film enough time to develop the story in its complexity again following the books lead
Oct 24 2021,positive,yes it could have been more psychedelic and i continue to be slightly annoyed by villeneuves obsession with imagery that is too clean orderly and monocolor for my taste even the dirt and grime in his films are spotless but the books wonderful weirdness is still there and i was pleasantly surprised to see the heavy word building and exposition was neither too watered down nor so tedious the movie came to a screeching halt even time they had to explain what was going on
Oct 24 2021,negative,the volume was too low for my tv i had to turn it off
Oct 24 2021,positive,part one of two and its fantastic it provides plenty of substance and leaves you wanting more
Oct 24 2021,positive,not bad if definitely watch a sequel
Oct 24 2021,negative,very boring about 2 hours to long dont waste your money
Oct 24 2021,positive,they have to make part two or this is terrible
Oct 24 2021,positive,a movie you must see in the theater  a tv screen doesnt do it justice fyi  i also saw it on hbo max
Oct 24 2021,positive,absolutely amazing this movie is nearly 2 12 hours long and you will want to hit the restroom before entering the theater because you will not want to leave the movie is captivating
Oct 24 2021,positive,loved it they have to make part ii now yeah it couldve done with more color more visual stimulation there but would that have been true to the novel lord knows the anal uberobsessive fans of the book would call them on that not that they wont call them on this that  the other anyway hey its a book its not your life or your possession jeez   i really like the choices made by villaneue the producers production design staff costume designers camera people the editor art direction and of course the writing as well its certainly a world all its own they created on the screen in my mind   seems some critics expected something else have not read the novel so they seem to not get why the tone and energy vibe of the movie is what it is but it worked exceptionally well for me   chalamet is one of the most fascinating actors working at the moment i was excited when i first saw he would play the lead here and he didnt disappoint not that he has yet for me rebecca ferguson is wonderful too shes a great presence with palpable strength and skill as an actor oscar isaac was made for this role conveying the sense of father husband and leader with equal authenticity momoa continues to grow and improve also quite good are the always reliable stellan skarsgård duncanbrewster and charlotte rampling as a potent reverend mother great choice there  so now its the wait no doubt at least two years for part ii thankfully theres always plenty of fine movies to get me by till then 41 stars
Oct 24 2021,positive,i thought the movie was great i saw some of the mainstream reviews but i disagree with their perspective and feelings about the music  i felt it did much better than the original movie on setting up the political discord the freemen perspective and why all this happens i also believe they did an awesome job of picking the actors they chose  so looking forward to part 2
Oct 24 2021,negative,im not a scifi fantasy fani tried going along with the movie it just did not work for mei thought special effects were repetitiouscould have shaves 12 hour off the movieand please dont hand me this best picture nonsense there are a lot of good movies on the way that will easily compete  for best pictureso much sand bring a canteen of water
Oct 24 2021,positive,i cancelled my ticket in a abundance of cautionhopefully after nov 4 here in la county the theaters will start asking for proof of vaccination for covid until then im not comfortable in a theater setting
Oct 24 2021,positive,easily the best audiovisual experience ever in a movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,i really enjoyed it i was afraid of it being too conceptual a well spoken dialogue accompaniment starts the story and moves it along i felt like everything was given equal weight characters and design costume designs for the different alien races was easy to distinguish i liked the character of paul atriedes i was excited to see heavy hitters like stellan skarsgard as the baron jason mamoa as duncan idaho and oscar issac as the duke leto atriedes josh brolin plays sort of a part that didnt have the impact for me i thought it could i loved that the sand worms are only glimpses and you dont see anything that gives away its design i thought it flowed almost like a roman drama to me with betrayals unexpected aly and obviously the idea of paul being the savior of the people of this planet and people no one cared for compelling enough for me to want to see movie 2
Oct 24 2021,negative,tooo long story line was bland not good at all
Oct 24 2021,positive,grim story visuals outstanding acting is mostly good but is very secondary to the events and the world the world is very much a character in this film villeneuve doesnt skimp on visuals of the desert and very large set pieces it is very well done but i did not really care about paul and if i dont care about the central character i dont know if i care enough that a sequel will be done and i do want a sequel because i really like wellmade movies like this i like bigscreen movies with big drama a lot
Oct 24 2021,positive,i came to this movie knowing nothing with my husband whos a huge fan of the book and film from the 80s i am now a super fan everything about this movie was so well done the score the fight scenes the subterfuge the special effects the movie was so compelling that it did not feel like 25 hours had even passed its insane to think that this was just the world building intro film most of the time those are generally boring with a lot of character introductions this accomplished a successful launch of what is absolutely going to be one of the best scifi franchises in history
Oct 24 2021,positive,precise deliberate visually stunning these are the aspects of denis villeneuves films that come to mind when i think on his filmography dune is no different everything about this film is top notch every shot seems perfectly framed a work of cinematic art only complaint i have is the almost complete lack of levity
Oct 24 2021,positive,it was only half the movie actually disappointed was really looking forward to the movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,fantastic movie and true to the book  will watch it again for sure
Oct 24 2021,positive,the movie is what a book adaptation should be  its visually stunning and the acting is superb i saw the movie on imax which was worth it for the desert scenes
Oct 24 2021,positive,this was the most thorough telling of the dune saga i have seen the plot and action were beautifully portrayed the acting was solid and you can feel the moods set forth by the writing very palpable film
Oct 24 2021,positive,loved the movie acting wasgreat special effects were awesome without overpowering the story sand worms terrifying just as they should be cant wait for part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,i thought dune was great  it followed the book well and was easy to understand by any firsttimers to the dune universe  i cant wait for part two
Oct 24 2021,positive,i think villeneuve did an excellent job bringing dune to the silver screen im probably in the minority wishing the movie had been a tad longer to better flesh out some secondary characters but otherwise it was actually better than i expected given the difficult source material  many have criticized the ending of this first part but i think it was forced on the director by the studio decision to not finance both parts of the movie at once given the severalyear production pause he had to stop at a point where his younger actors could age a bit without it looking jarring in the resulting film
Oct 24 2021,positive,too long and boring
Oct 24 2021,positive,stunning denis villeneuve is pitchperfect at every level
Oct 24 2021,positive,better than the original not much action good special effects and acting better than the original
Oct 24 2021,positive,visually stunning world building is amazing politics the same very much enjoyed and look forward to seeing more
Oct 24 2021,positive,dune is excellent the story simplify the book and make it clearer for the movie yes it doesnt loose time on the navigator stuff but dv did use the witches clan in this story which i think clarifies a lot of things regarding paul his mother and the political factions there are great epic scenes in this movie the main battle is great but doesnt turned into a cgi fest the sand worm are really done well the way they present paul visions is intriguing for the watcher the music of hanz is superb and the sounds effect in theatres are a blast to listen to i though there were some colourized scenes that had some poor choice of settings i give it 88 a superior dune adaptation and better rhythm then blade runner 2049 dont miss out on it this is way easier then reading the books but could serve has a great introduction
Oct 24 2021,positive,far superior to the original movie better presentation better acting and better cinematography part one ended in a good place love javier bardem jason momoa oscar issac and josh brolin
Oct 24 2021,positive,omg freaking awesome  too bad we have to wait for the next one uhhhh
Oct 24 2021,positive,amazing storyamazing cast  a great experience
Oct 24 2021,positive,i was really good so glad it was faithful to the book as good as a movie can be anyway good job
Oct 24 2021,positive,good movie visually stunning but very much part one  feel a bit cheated
Oct 24 2021,positive,grand epic look forward to part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,i mean its dune you are either gonna love it or not keeps the main thrust of the story moving forward and while cutting a lot of great stuff still manages to get the story going the biggest question for me is if they are going to make part 2 if not then its a visually stunning half of a story
Oct 24 2021,positive,great cast but slow  should have finished it all in one movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,great acting and special effects compelling storyline
Oct 24 2021,positive,the job that denise do to adapt this universe is really impresive the world building is amazing hope to see more of this
Oct 24 2021,positive,easily the most visually compelling entry into the world of dune while deftly parsing the complex plot and characters from frank herberts original novel denis villeneuve has demonstrated again that he is a master of consistent narrative through the visor of shifting perspective given the limited screen time between paul and his mentors for instance we nonetheless get a sense for how they see him and why we might share their opinion this was a feature of sicario arrival and blade runner 2049 but brought into sharp focus with paul atreides of dune villeneuve continues to prove he is amongst the most talented makers in cinema
Oct 24 2021,positive,stunningly beautiful  great storytelling wo the use of extraneous epilogue or voice over narration i wasnt sure id buy timothee chalamet as paul but he was perfect 
Oct 24 2021,positive,no bookmovie is flawless but this comes pretty close
Oct 24 2021,positive,an incredible movie with matching action acting and true scifi wonder
Oct 24 2021,positive,this is an excellent first part in a two or three part story the risk youre taking is that theres no assurance of those additional parts being made  so viewer beware as a standalone film itd be as if lord of the rings stopped at fellowship of the ring
Oct 24 2021,positive,very entertaining movie looking forward to part two
Oct 24 2021,positive,the visuals and sound design make this a must see in theaters
Oct 24 2021,positive,true to the book didnt move too fast  got into their thoughts and plots the way the book did majestic big screen worthy film could have used a bit more insight into the harkonens and the emperor minor complaints about certain actors but thats normal overall really good  hate that itll be a really long wait for the next one shame on warner bros for that
Oct 24 2021,positive,amazing film definitely glad i chose to watch it in theaters instead of watching it on hbo max definitely movie that needs to be experienced in theaters
Oct 24 2021,positive,thank all the gods they didnt take this overthetop woke i thought it was fantastic you probably have to know whats going on in this version as you cant hear every thought that pops into their heads like the original also much less 80s rock guitar which maybe isnt a good thing and no oiled up sting still great
Oct 24 2021,positive,one of the best book adaptations out there must watch
Oct 24 2021,positive,slow to set the story obviously with any scifi theres a lot of worldhistory building but it was beautiful to watch the acting was great i was excited to watch this with the trailer that came out being a big asimov fan i was not disappointed in the least super excited for the sequels and for the next episode of foundation
Oct 24 2021,positive,very abrupt ending loved the details and think that the 2nd part will be a hit
Oct 24 2021,positive,movie was great and very happy its part one so they dont cram the story up but some of the 3d was bizarre and lots of whispering with very very loud background noise so often could not hear what people were saying
Oct 24 2021,negative,dune is long and boring
Oct 24 2021,positive,god created arrakis to test the faithful denis villeneuve directed dune to reward them some will try to compare dune to star wars or lord of the rings dune is neither of those dune is not a simple tale of good vs evil this is a grown up look at the heroes journey and the exploitation of resources and people no matter what the ads say dune is not the next star wars and i am thankful for it
Oct 24 2021,positive,had very high expectations going in and was delivered an even higher level of cinema do yourself a favor and see this in the theaterimax if you can
Oct 24 2021,positive,great start to a new franchise
Oct 24 2021,positive,i wished i had seen this movie in imax instead of my tv i really really liked the visual it is  amazing   but found some of the characters hard to keep up with it helped to be able to look up the actual actors so you could say of yea thats josh not jason etc
Oct 24 2021,positive,slow start but finished strong looking forward to the next one
Oct 24 2021,positive,dune was an amazing viewing experience
Oct 24 2021,positive,the visual spectacle and uniformly good performances keep things interesting but the story never gathers enough momentum to justify the epic scale and pace  its ultimately proof that source material as rich and complex as dune is probably unfilmable at least not within the confines of two theatrical movies  a limited series wouldve served the narrative better
Oct 24 2021,positive,as someone who has never read the books and saw the 84 version as a garbage 80s movie this was epic everything i wanted it to be and has introduced me to a world that i intend to dive into     highlights were the acting timothee chalamet rebecca ferguson jason momoa and oscar issac all came with their agame and made me fall for the family dynamic and house atradies as a whole further the action was amazing but not overdone every action sequence felt like it belonged and the movie definitely didnt rely on it the music and cinematography could not have been better and even if you dont love the story youll stay for the audio and visual experience highly recommend seeing it in the theaters       overall a
Oct 24 2021,positive,epic story wonderfully told
Oct 24 2021,positive,gorgeous to look at and beautifully acted its a completely immersive movie experience and i was ready to watch it again as soon as the credits began to roll cant wait for part 2
Oct 24 2021,negative,literally nothing happens
Oct 24 2021,positive,movie was great but it wasnt advertised as only being part one so i was disappointed the movie ended where it did looking forward to part two
Oct 24 2021,positive,while denis is known for epic wide angle flyby shots accompanied by powerful synthetic music both things i love in moderation he overused this technique in dune part one so much so that he ended up sacrificing much needed story structure  the amount of content that was discarded for the sake of visuals has hurt the overall narrative
Oct 24 2021,positive,gorgeous intelligent the touches on caladan at the leaving the clarity to imperial politics the sere monochromatic city arrakeen the scale of the ships  the cast is so resonant with the story the clarity of the story the patience of the telling the detail are a marvel to rein in the epic so as to tell pauls story is an act of directorial nerve
Oct 24 2021,positive,graphic were awesome
Oct 24 2021,positive,epic stunningly beautiful with a great story and characters well acted stunning cinematography impressive production and sound design with a sweeping score everything you could have hoped for and more best appreciated on a big screen with a state of the art sound system dont miss it and wb you better finish this gem with a sequel
Oct 24 2021,positive,much better than the first version lots of detail but having read the book it was easy for me to follow i was surprised that the audience loved it it remains a masterpiece scifi
Oct 24 2021,positive,this was honestly the best movie i have ever seen in my entire life the scale the beauty the film score and the story are unlike anything i have seen before so epic
Oct 24 2021,positive,as true to the book as could be done visually impressive
Oct 24 2021,positive,a massive masterpiece of storytelling digital art and sound design this film and series will stand the test of time 
Oct 24 2021,neutral,it was epic but nothing more not much character development skipped keep character development scenes and too much of the same score
Oct 24 2021,positive,they somehow filmed my imagination when i first read the book
Oct 24 2021,positive,very true to the book excellent acting and music score great experience and im looking forward to future installments
Oct 24 2021,positive,fantastic  the acting was incredible  anyone who knows the story knows that much of the dialogue is internal this cast was easily able to translate that through action and expressions  cant wait for the sequel
Oct 24 2021,positive,this was the first movie i was willing to see in a theater in a while and this film did not disappoint   i have been waiting for a movie such as this that has a visual experience that suits the big screen
Oct 24 2021,positive,the best thing in theaters right now villeneuve has made a masterpiece the only thing wrong with it is that its half the story you will leave the theater wanting way more
Oct 24 2021,positive,very well done with more details and effects than the original cant wait for the rest of the story in the next movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,perfectly cast very cinematic
Oct 24 2021,positive,for being only half a movie it grabbed me everything you want a scifi epic to be
Oct 24 2021,negative,frank herberts 1965 scifi masterpiece is as intricately woven with complex relationships between characters as it is with lore and imagined physical detail  any undertaking to bring frank herberts dune to film is a daunting undertaking  david lynch was barely able to pull it off with his 1984 attempt even by standards of fans who had read the novel beforehand  denis villeneuves much vaunted two part version of dune the third cinematic run at the scifi tome dissipatedly falls flat on two counts    the film part one begins with its first hour as a regurgitation of the lynch version almost verbatim and shotbyshot in some instances  this may not be a bad thing for those that have not seen the lynch version or read the book  as villeneuves dune plods on it gets lost in the space between the complex lore of herberts dune universe and an attempt to be concise and approachable  i cant help but imagine for someone that had not experienced any of the prior versions that they would find it difficult to follow  for me someone that has experienced many of the prior versions i found it half handed and uninteresting    many of the key characters performance in dune are delivered two dimensionally  new comer timothe chalamets delivery of paul atreides just cant seem to draw me into the galactic power and spiritual struggle that is beginning to unfold  even veteran bad guy actor stellan skarsgrds portrayal of baron vladimir harkonnen falls flat  baron vladimir harkonnen one of the most vial and corrupt characters in the history of scifi should repulse mortify outrage anger  instead villeneuve gives us a morbidly obese guy that cant support his own body weight and talks with his mouth full  josh brolins roll as gurney halleck is reduced to merely more than a cameo  veterans rebecca ferguson and benicio del toro give solid performances and save the film  honorable mention for jason momoa as he makes the transition from super hero to super soldier    special effects are great top shelf of course expect nothing less from a villeneuve scifi film  shaihulud sand worm gives its greatest performance to date    im a big villeneuve fan  after his blade runner 2049 my expectations were high very high  but once again frank herberts sands of arrakis proved to be fatal to nonfermen
Oct 24 2021,positive,visually stunning well acted a saga of epic proportions
Oct 24 2021,positive,love the movie felt they took some liberty but they said true to the story  special effects were great and the acting was amazing  strongly recommend seeing it in theaters the sound system and big screen makes a big difference
Oct 24 2021,positive,saw it on hbomax last night great captivating movie with good story line and fantastic screen play stunning visuals almost reminded me of the mandalorian but with much better casting great work by rebecca ferguson as lady jessica javier bardem sitlgar needed more screen time in dune i think that would be fixed in the second movie   storyline is complex and compressed for 230hr screen time if some audience felt sleepy cause they were looking for a braindead action film they should rather go watch jungle cruise by the rock and emily blunt takenvii or some dumb horror movie with no story
Oct 24 2021,positive,as someone who read the book it was a 5 star movie the visuals are absolutely incredible and they absolutely nailed the tone clearly made by a fan who wanted to stay true to the source material    for those who havent read the book i expect the first third of the movie will be very confusing so ill leave off half a star
Oct 24 2021,positive,beautiful worlds strong acting performances and good score however the plot drags and is often overly dramatic it often feels like there has been more effort in trying to amaze with sound and sight than in writing an interesting script that brings the viewer into that world
Oct 24 2021,positive,love the books loved the movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,spectacular all way round
Oct 24 2021,positive,while it is a film with few flaws i really liked it for a variety of reasons it is gorgeously shot and a visuallypleasuring experience with great cast members and acting when javier bardem showed up on screen along with josh brolin i couldnt help but smile especially since i also love no country for old men plus the sound effects were awesome and left me wanting more of it i am looking forward to part 2 since it left me in a curious state and i enjoyed being introduced to this unique sciif world
Oct 24 2021,positive,ive read all the books and seen the 80s film and this movie is exactly what i was hoping for as a huge fan of the series even if you dont know anything about the world of dune i bet youll like this if you like scifi
Oct 24 2021,positive,ive heard horror stories of the 1984 movie and got to watch the scifi miniseries taking my husband to see this was the best decision the visuals and pacing felt right the story felt more fleshed out than the miniseries and it ended at the right moment my husband and i loved this we really had fun and hope to see more in the future excellent work
Oct 24 2021,positive,visually stunning the music and sound design was entrancing its a great dune adaptation unfortunately since a lot of storytelling happens in the characters thoughts in the book not being able to hear the characters thoughts in a story like this is a bit of a drawback which is understandable it didnt ruin the movie it just made the narrative feel weak saw it twice in theaters will probably watch it again soon on hbo max
Oct 24 2021,positive,dune is an astonishing achievement in scifi cinema everyone in the cast plays their role incredibly well timothée chalamet kills it in the lead role rebecca ferguson josh brolin oscar isaac and jason momoa also stood out in their roles on a technical level this film was truly masterful it looked absolutely gorgeous the visuals were top notch and hans zimmers score was perfect im a sucker for heady scifi so it makes a lot of sense that i was very invested in what was happening while this is certainly a part one the ending wasnt dissatisfying i have not read the books and im happy to say i didnt have trouble following the lore it didnt feel dumbed down but it was accessible enough for the average viewer to follow overall this was everything i wanted and more denis villeneuve knocks it out of the park yet again i cant wait for part two 
Oct 24 2021,positive,loved it great special effects music filming and acting  cant wait for part 2
Oct 24 2021,neutral,soooo long and boring  no climax just flat
Oct 24 2021,positive,in a world were most science fiction content has to fall off the pages of a comic book it is refreshing to see some studios taking a chance with this challenging literary  classic warner brothers with denis villeneuve have made the long wait worth while  this is an incredible marvelous  production with stunning visuals some fellow critics found the film to be slow but we are not viewing mortal kombat for its 235 length i was completely enthralled thought out the movie and surprised at its abrupt ending the only drawbacks were its pg13 rating and that its a two part epic that means i am going to have to wait again with trepidation for the conclusion of this masterpiece
Oct 24 2021,positive,i truly believe this movie can be enjoyed anywhere a good film can fully realized in any format but ive seen this three times once on hbo max once in a normal theater and now in imax and imax truly brings the immersion factor to a maximum it looks immaculate denis and his cinematographer really understood the assignment and hans zimmers score never sounds better than when it comes booming through the massive speakers and of course when you get those sequences that were filmed with imax cameras and you get to see the world unfold from floor to ceiling on the massive screen it feels larger than life all the crew behind the movie made me feel like herberts novel came to life but imax may be the best way to feel transported to another world for a truly immersive and remarkable experience the movie itself is excellent and will feel even better when we get part two to build on it
Oct 24 2021,positive,amazing movie  looking forward to part 2 
Oct 24 2021,positive,fantastic movie stunning visuals and music cant wait for part 2 
Oct 24 2021,negative,omgway to complex but enjoyed the actors and the scenery
Oct 24 2021,positive,phenomenal cinematography deep complex plot  transcendent story line
Oct 24 2021,positive,excited to see the second part
Oct 24 2021,neutral,if like me youre a fan of the 1984 version with the elaborate costumes and sets you will be disappointed with the 2022 version the storyline is very slow in the beginning and ends very abruptly in at the end with no payoff  the movie stays relatively true to frank herberts novel at least in part one i will go see part two not because i loved part one but because i already invested my time and the price of a ticket for part one
Oct 24 2021,positive,everything in the movie is apsolutley fenomenal
Oct 24 2021,positive,this movie taught me how overrated starwars actually is i say this as a huge star wars nerd    absolutely gorgeous movie with lots of innovative takes on the sciencefiction genre  amazing world building and great actors already looking forward to the continuation of the story   1010 would watch again anytime
Oct 24 2021,positive,great movie maybe the best sci fi ever
Oct 24 2021,positive,i liked how this remake focus on the relationship between paul and the people around himwhat each person meant to him  it is a doubleedged sword  because of the relationships i felt it made the story much slower than the original version
Oct 24 2021,positive,wayyyy slower than i was expecting and a little tricky to follow it 
Oct 24 2021,neutral,even thought this movie has decent visuals and interesting soundtrack it is boring and characters are left undeveloped costumes and set decorations are well made but feel derivative and ultimately uninspiring the movie is watchable but there is no drama no innovation and no memorable events i would be surprised if they make part 2
Oct 24 2021,negative,wow 20 or 30 years later and it still just as bad  completely clueless as to the plot line the spice apparently is the most important thing in the universe but they keep blowing up the plant and they have weapons that can fire all kinds of explosives but choose to fight with knives this is a mediocre story and a mediocre movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,mesmerisingly beautiful and masterfully built to reflect humanities nature crafting an unforgettable experience dennis villeneuve managed to construct a truly unique world based on frank herberts timeless work
Oct 24 2021,positive,great story just wished they would have finished the story with back to back part 1 2 without a delay 2020 has created a new meaning to binge watching
Oct 24 2021,positive,the best cinematography of the dune efforts to date undecided on the screenplay the angle of making it more of an emotive angst filled journey for paul actually works somewhat when viewed solely as the story of paul attreidesat least so far dune is a classic because of its depth much like lord of the rings and its nearly impossible to capture enough details of the story in 3 films much less 1 or 2 lotr did very well in 3 though a bunch of great book content was lostchanged and fans were satisfied with where movie 1 ended so far the politics and the character development of dune is nil in this version but it is pretty well acted with mostly very good acting choices the limited action was well doneclean shaven jason momoa particularly was impressive in his fight scenes it will need to be finally judged when its sequel arrives  i believe dune fans will find weakness there simply isnt any depth for characters besides paul no introspection no flashbacks to paint emotional pictures or make us care about them or their intentions but big plot points are there the scenery is grand and well presented a slightly more visually horrific baron would be nice but we may see more of that in part 2 3 stars is what it deserves so far because the plot point it ended on and the lack of chapter finality of that point leave this as more of an incomplete than a grade but i do want to see how it plays out  by comparison rewatching the 1984 version is almost painful now david lynch was always unconventional and it really made an already difficult and at times confusing story worse not betterplus its visual effects needed to be these but technology hadnt arrived yet and it shows but lynch made a movie nobody wants to see again even to see if they like it more this one i do wanna see the sequel so it has a chance to be the dune it sets out to be but we wont know for awhile
Oct 24 2021,positive,if you like scifi it doesnt get much better than this movies like this dont get made often enough definitely see it on the big screen preferably in imax if you can i cant say enough about this film
Oct 24 2021,positive,a very cool scifi film with a great story line that i hope will be resolved in part 2 i was unaware that this film was originally a book and it was a little hard to follow for the first part of the movie however things started to come together and it ended up making sense i felt some of the visions were a bit drawn out and that there was too many of them however the visuals and audio made this movie a true experience in the theater
Oct 24 2021,positive,dennis villeneuves dune will go down in history as one of the greatest scifi films ever made the stunning visuals immersive sound and powerful cast combine to bring frank herberts historic work alive on the big screen
Oct 24 2021,positive,yes the pacing was slow but man oh man do you lose yourself in this world its been said and said again the cinematography and soundtrack are so epic they basically drag you into the screen i recommend seeing it in theaters the bigger the screen the better i wish all sifi movies were like this smart and well made vs dumb and full of boring action
Oct 24 2021,negative,super slow moving part 1 of 2 and it could prob be condensed too many shots of walking and slow moving it was mumbled and low voiced so half the time couldnt understand what they were saying saw it in theaters wouldnt recommend
Oct 24 2021,negative,great visuals but ultimately a boring movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,i am not always a scifi fan but this movie was beautiful exciting tense and hopeful  casting was spot on throughout  it was ultimately a coming of age story with an incredible backdrop and complex plot that the director artfully navigates so you never feel lost
Oct 24 2021,negative,this hurt  i truly wanted to sink my teeth into the narrative and let it carry me but ive never had the patience to read the source material and every attempt to get there has just felt long and plodding it sounded like maybe this might be the one to break through but when an hour had passed and we were still establishing more planets and peoples my wife and i threw our hands up at the umpteenth title card  my wife summed up the first hour best i want the last two hours of my life back
Oct 24 2021,positive,though i was left very confused by the end even with all the exposition this movie provided i did find myself enjoying it most of the way through it has a lot of concepts that i really enjoyed  as ive learned about the source material ive learned that this is only about half of what the 1st book explored so i am 100 on board for part 2 of this it is a heavily relied story on space politics which i do believe is definitely not for everyone
Oct 24 2021,positive,hard to follow but i didnt know anything about the book or previous movies
Oct 24 2021,positive,as an imax experience its pretty impressive cinematography exellent score exellent acting top notch production realistic and authentichowever this version of dune isnt as special as it wants to be one is if a second movie isnt bank rolled it leaves everyone hanging and two it lacks any outside of the box concepts to be honest i think lynchs dune was way more entertaining 
Oct 24 2021,positive,my reason for giving it a full rating is that dune is my favorite movie of 2021 
Oct 24 2021,negative,slow and not entertaining great actors who seem bored
Oct 24 2021,positive,i enjoyed this movie  it is visually pleasing the acting was great the music story the action the set designs wardrobe and technology designsjust fantastic job all around  ive never read the source material so i cannot speak on how well the books were adapted to the big screen but this film made me want to read the books and the source material  hopefully the directorcastwriterscrew are green lit to do sequels because this has the potential to be more than just a cult classic and potentially overshadow some other space operas and franchises out there    i watched this on hbo max and i enjoyed it enough to make plans to watch this on the big screen because i want to make sure that this film gets the box office numbers to match    great job to everyone involved in this project
Oct 24 2021,positive,wow totally extraordinary and well done film i cant wait for part 2 
Oct 24 2021,negative,one of the worst movies ever
Oct 24 2021,positive,soooooo much better than the 1984 adaptation the visuals are topnotch the unwieldy worldbuilding is handled well without being too explainy and the acting is stellar across the board part 2 absolutely needs to happen and then we need some high quality hbo spinoffs for dune messiah through god emperor
Oct 24 2021,positive,very good movie disappointed that this was part 1 with part 2 in preproduction and not even confirmed
Oct 24 2021,positive,this movie was incredible some may find it hard to watch if they came expecting a marvel movie but this movie was so well done one of the best booktoscreen adaptations i have ever seen bring on part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,being a huge star wars fan this is hard but dune is wayyy better the cinematography music and character development are incredible saw it yesterday and still cant stop thinking about it see this movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,although the movie followed closely to the book it was a sleeper would have liked to have seen less flashback scenes and a little more action when there was action it was very short lived the costumes and concept were on point though
Oct 24 2021,positive,absolute pleasure to watch loved every second cant wait for more    i was so glad they didnt try to fit the whole book in one movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,this is what imax was made for  just stunning
Oct 24 2021,positive,experience in the theater was excellent especially the sound  compared the the 1984 version they were able to take more time developing each scene and that was nice of course they could only get through about half of the story in 2 12 hours not sure the whispering of the internal dialogue was that much better than what lynch did  they had better make part 2  i want to see the second act
Oct 24 2021,negative,it was too long the plot and character development was weak and its scenery and machinery were copies of older star wars props yah the young kid is some kind of messiah and i am sure that part 2 gets a little deeper into character development and hopefully over a much shorter time period but i dont think i will see part 2 if you read the book when you were young i am sure this movie means more to you than some one coming in from the start now it wasnt awful but if i had other things to do i wouyld have skipped it see the last duel much better
Oct 24 2021,positive,quickest two hours in a movie theatre in a long time for sure the last two years enjoyed the movie from start to finish
Oct 24 2021,positive,i watched the old version last night  the updated version today the  special effects and the actors was a real treat highly recommend watching hbo max or in the  theater
Oct 24 2021,negative,give me back my saturday night hours i do regret this slow burning boring film waiting for the excitement that never came dont waste your time like i did 
Oct 24 2021,positive,visual masterpiece superb acting and storytelling 
Oct 24 2021,positive,they stayed true to the book storyline it started out slow but then picked up the pace  cant wait to see what they do in part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,a stunning movie with an amazing combination of a beautiful score amazing visuals topnotch acting and a compelling chosen one story though the chosen one trope has been done thousands of times before there is something truly human about this movie that makes us all connect with it this movie series has the potential to be one of the greatest of all a must watch for all as there is something for everyone
Oct 24 2021,positive,if you are a fan of the books you should absolutely enjoy this adaptation i loved it but if might be helpful to know that it does not complete the 1st dune book i was getting tense watching it with an hour left i was like how are they going to cram it all in luckily they dont and if they do it in a way that we dont need it to continue but i really hope that they do
Oct 24 2021,positive,having read the books i can say that this is about as faithful of a retelling as youre ever going to get in its own right this is still a great movie and you really dont need to have read the books to understand whats going on the books have so much detail but the movie does a great job of giving it to you without things getting boring or slow id highly recommend
Oct 24 2021,negative,not worth the money to see if you are a fan of the original you are walking away mad as this is only the first half of the original movie the movie just movies too slow
Oct 24 2021,positive,i must point out that i neither read the book nor watched the first film incarnation of dune but i do live in a desert this current version is visually beautiful to behold and the lead actors do the best they can as plot explainers because this is basically all that is asked of them the complicated setup is fairly well presented in what is presumably the first half of a film duet yet the entire affair is emotionally inert lacking a single moment or character that engages the emotions and did they really have to throw a veil and a fishnet over charlotte ramplings face when awards are handed out only the technical crew will go home with the gold
Oct 24 2021,positive,a stunning movie  the visuals attention to visual scale lighting technologies languages the technoculture of the housesall put together and crafted with meticulous attention to detail there is so much visual detail that you cant catch the major visual items in one pass you have to watch this a few times from different angles  one of my biggest pet peeves in scifi movies is a lack of actual scientific attention to nonterrestrial detail ie camerons navi speaks in essentially an earthbased aboriginal style which which makes me groan whenever i hear it spoken in the avatar movie  the various languages devised in dune both spoken and nonspoken were built to illustrate a better understanding of what nonterrestrial languages might soundlike or looklike ie the introduction of the sardaukar shock troops is a great example of this in action  dune does an amazing job at keeping it smart even down to the smallest of details eg the moisture efficient desert mouse    this isnt a slow movie i mean gandhi 1982 that was a slow movie it moves at a perfect pace read the books and you will realize this was crafted with care  of course if you want super speed in the movie runtime then go watch star wars  another chief complaint i have about many highconcept scifi movies to much talking with grade school dialogue movies need to spend more time to visually explain what is occurring and dune does this extremely well    we watched it in a 3d format and the whole family came along and all of us walked out of that theater blown away from end to end including the highly connected 14 year old had his attention all the way through  we found the anthropological technocomplex of the entire movie to be fantastically illustrated  we cant wait to see part two
Oct 24 2021,positive,excellent acting beautiful scenery well cast and written in such a way as to fully immerse you into the different cultures you encounter throughout the film
Oct 24 2021,negative,i think they say in britain bloody rubbish yep thats this movie 
Oct 24 2021,positive,they did the book justice absolutely blew me away one of the best movies i have seen in  a long time
Oct 24 2021,positive,have read the book multiple times and watched the previous dune movie this one is like watching the original lord of the rings movie as it ends in the middle of the story and similarly is incomplete without a sequel somewhat disappointing look forward to the sequels
Oct 24 2021,positive,this film is phenomenal everything works in this film as a matter of fact this film transcends watching it becomes an experience the cinematography the score the acting the story the action everything goes above and beyond this demands to be seen and watched over and over again this film is amazing
Oct 24 2021,positive,great film really holds up with the book
Oct 24 2021,positive,i was shocked that hollywood got this movie so good its pitch perfect
Oct 24 2021,positive,i read the book  watched the david lynch movie multiple times      i expected much from denis villeneuve  and i did get that  the problem is that its not the much i was looking for  i think this film wants to not be the 1984 film so much that it constrains itself in the acting and story    the actors apart from jason momoa  who shines in this spend so much of their time brooding that you cant tell them apart  its only when the dialogue diverges from the book where one actually sees a glimmer of character   its like the lines are being recited rather than acted  competent but lacking depth      it is beautiful  the soundtrack will annoy your patience    but at its core its just bland  no spice to it
Oct 24 2021,positive,denis villeneuve achieved the impossible adapting the almostimpossible to film source material for the big screen and what a show it is while the film struggles a bit with its pacing i believe its writing and the casting for a few secondary roles it will certainly please both fans and initiated  an even more impossible task the adaptation of the most cerebral aspects of the books is in my opinion perfectly balanced for the big screen  it is still present but doesnt get heavy at all while as a fan i could have used more of it i understand these choices which were probably made to please wider audiences thus increasing the chances to see a part two  but it stayed loyal to the books all the strangeness and mystical mood is very well rendered too  through visions through the incredible sound track stunning and trippy at places visuals and acting i feel that this is as faithful to the books as it can be well except maybe a tad short even for half a story it could have used another half hour of runtime i would have loved to see the banquet with characters reading and political play and also i would have loved to see more of liet kynes  or dr kynes  with deeper explanations of arrakiss ecology and her plan for it nonetheless even if it felt a bit clunky at a very few places this is a cinematic masterpiece and will certainly be villeneuves magnum opus once completed im craving to see the directors cut of this movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,dune is a must watch for anyone who loves large world building and aestheticss in sci fi
Oct 24 2021,negative,not a fan of the firstone but at least it was not as slow as the new one  seems to drag and the action sequences are not worth the wait  the whispering is not done well had to have subtitles on to follow  feel asleep twice at least and finally turned off  liked the old sand worms as well
Oct 24 2021,positive,this was a very good movie it followed the book well cant wait for the next movie to come out
Oct 24 2021,positive,as a big fan of the book im so happy with this magnificent adaptation
Oct 24 2021,positive,denis u did it the dialogues are a bit stiff
Oct 24 2021,positive,exquisite craftmanship the music and sound design would make me go again and watch it with my eyes closed
Oct 24 2021,positive,what a film i felt transported to another world and completely lost track of time the only problem it has is that its half a story cant wait wait for dune part 2
Oct 24 2021,negative,it sucked the story was incoherent it had very little to with the books it took its name from
Oct 24 2021,negative,while visually stunning the boring characters long exposition dumps dull acting and slowww pace makes this movie more likely to put you to sleep then wow you i wish it had focused more on the political side then the characters because the characters were boring but a galactic empire with multiple family clans sounds perfect got a game of thrones style political scifi thriller but sadly as were adapting from a i assume better book were stuck with a boring chosen one narrative within a wider more interesting universe then was again i presume better explored in the book
Oct 24 2021,positive,great movie the world and transport were beautifully done and it nailed a few key scenes sure it left us wanting more but i always knew it was part one cant wait for part two
Oct 24 2021,positive,the cinematography storyline acting and most all the soundtrack were absolutely astonishing one of the best if not the best theater experiences i have ever had  denis villeneuve truly never misses
Oct 24 2021,positive,engrossing stunning visuals outstanding performances
Oct 24 2021,positive,dune was 2h 35m but it was only part i  its like is part ii tomorrow night  it has the same  recipe of scifi with pseudotaoism as star wars it is very entertaining and lives up to the hype
Oct 24 2021,positive,thought it was very well done authentic to the book for the most part some of the dialog was hard to hear but the movie itself was great  im a longtime dune fan so i was apprehensive but satisfied
Oct 24 2021,positive,dune is huge spectacular has a big scope great pacing stunning visuals compelling story and characterizations left me wanting to 1 see more and 2 rewatch it again and again just to taste after every new rewatch all the corners and details in the scenes that ive been missing    denis villeneuve is the director and wb is really lucky to have him on board for this massive story he perfectly nails the space opera political dramatic elements    with a simple narrative that flows smoothly like the spice in the desert dune 2021 sets a solid beginning for this immense journey ahead of us and deserves all the love and the praise
Oct 24 2021,negative,effects were great but it didnt seem like they told a story just a part of one there was a lot of missing detail from the original its seems i sat for almost 3 hours waiting for something that never happened hopefully part 2 wraps it all up id wait til part two comes out and watch them both not really into there choices for main actor especially when you have mamoa it looks like an attempt to save money
Oct 24 2021,positive,beautiful shot incredibly boring very drawn out dialogue and few action scenes only covers half the book part 2 should be better hopefullythis one was hard to stay awake to
Oct 24 2021,negative,moves so slow   the large battle between the houses holds no emotion  just a large amount of cgi  understand its just the first half but just abruptly ends in the weirdest spot
Oct 24 2021,positive,ive wanted to be a dune fan for decades now lynchs movie failed in so many ways where this one suceeded im in make part 2 beautiful visuals great cast amazing sound and art direction atmospheric and perfectly paced i want more glad i saw it in the theater planning to see it again in imax
Oct 24 2021,positive,knowing the books isnt a must but id recommend familiarizing yourself a little with the source material biggest thing that i felt i needed to know was that the seemingly human people in film from the different houses have unlocked abilities  not technologically driven but through the power of their minds their minds are elevated so much more than an our own and that is what enables the epic story being played out before you its so incredibly immersing and easily one of the most beautiful films ive ever seen you could freeze almost any frame and youd have a true work of art in front of you it may not be the immediate crowd pleaser some may expect but it definitely sets up for the rest of the story to unfold in a way that you will be 100 invested in what youre watching
Oct 24 2021,positive,they finally did it someone finally managed to get dune right  its on par with how well lotr was done
Oct 24 2021,positive,excellent movie cant wait for the second one 
Oct 24 2021,positive,unbelievably awesome
Oct 24 2021,negative,boring as heck beautiful film but doesnt out shadow the slow development and uninteresting character design big disappointment
Oct 24 2021,positive,the best beginning in a film franchise ive seen in a long time this is a good example of film becoming art
Oct 24 2021,positive,so very much presented as i imagined it when reading 4 times  love the dragonfly thopters
Oct 24 2021,positive,might be the prettiest looking movie ive seen
Oct 24 2021,positive,i did not know it was chapter 1  i thought it was much better than the first dune movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,exceptional acting directing cinematography storyline
Oct 24 2021,positive,this movie is a masterpiece from amazing sound and visuals to a riveting score and a great story it is very promising for a new franchise and omg the action is very good i give it an a
Oct 24 2021,negative,the movie was very slowpaced it took a half hour for a scene to develop that could have been done in five minutes  the speech in the beginning by soothsayer charlotte rampling was excruciatingly long  actors seemed to be speaking in dialogue filled with long dramatic pauses  also the sparse bleak sets had low production value and were uninteresting  the whole film was set in dull tones and put me to sleep  the special effects were poor given the huge budget for the movie  it seems like all the money was spent on the actors salaries  i counted an incredible 9 established actors all cashing in on this dud  finally the whole movie was leading up to the climax of the battle between the emporer and the fremens  but amazingly the battle never happened as it seems the movie hits its 25 hour mark and someone just said enough  the movie just ended setting up for the inevitable sequel which should never get made
Oct 24 2021,positive,visually exciting great cast i liked the book but wondered how it could translate as a movie i dont know that it could be done any better but it still left me feeling a little cold and disappointed also im really sick of sand now 
Oct 24 2021,negative,slow slow slow slow slow slow slow boring     my wife fell asleep i turned it off     the director is awful its not about the cinematography its about telling a story that keeps you engaged throughout the story and just because   the scene looks stunning it does not move the story along
Oct 24 2021,neutral,definitely not the epic saga it was touted to be the best way to sum it up is the inordinate amount of time the actors spend removing their lifesaving headgear at the most dangerous moments when youre not shaking your head wondering why the director is napping youll be tempted to take your own nap
Oct 24 2021,positive,from the beginning of the film it establishes a world that is eloquently fleshed out throughout the rest of the movie with plenty of bits of action to keep the watcher entertained
Oct 24 2021,positive,this is the best movie ive seen in many years highly recommend you experience it in the theater
Oct 24 2021,positive,one of the best movie ive seeing this year
Oct 24 2021,positive,from start to finish i was absolutely captivated one of my favorite movies in recent memory
Oct 24 2021,positive,the film brings herberts universe to life brilliantly entertaining stunning in its cinematography the cast is simply perfect for the characters with the baron looking magnificently grotesque and menacing the rich detail of the stories is still best enjoyed by reading the novels but i cant imagine any film doing a better job of bringing it to the big screen i want to see it again and cant wait for the sequel
Oct 24 2021,positive,i absolutely love the movie has been well worth the wait this movie is just amazing on all fronts all star cast every character has a moment to shine and standout everyone has a partvto play this movie does a great job of bringing the book to life the movie covers the first half of the first dune book and he does a great job of keeping it close to the just amazing special effects and visuals and is just splendidly amazing seeing on a imax screen i really cant wait to see how the next part will unfold because as far as the material that can be shown theres a lot of options available i think with dune we finally are going to see the original space epic of books become the saga that can be seen dominate the big screen for the next decade or 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,covers about 13 of the book dune and does an excellent job of bringing frank herberts written universe to life visuals  cgi are at times stunning think scale the complex relationships between house atriedes house harkonnen the bene gesserit the imperium the fremen and arrakis itself are outlined in sufficient detail that even those who have not read the book can follow the plot     too bad the banquet held to celebrate the atriedes takeover of arrakis wasnt included  but the overarching importance of water on this planet and liet kynes vision for a green  verdant arrakis are foreshadowed by the water droplets on the desert mouses ear the fremen name for this animal is mauddib and the plants seen in the deserted ecological testing station the eventual importance of the shield wall in the final battle for arrakis is also foreshadowed  at least for those who have read the book    overall have to give this 5 stars  sure hope the sequels there will have to be at least one if not two are as good or better
Oct 24 2021,negative,boring i fell asleep so many times they just added big names to get an audience i love me some zendaya timmy and drax but this movie was a snoozefest i felt like i was watching that sand video from jimmy neutron that students fell asleep too 
Oct 24 2021,positive,utterly engrossing i didnt want it to end
Oct 24 2021,positive,brilliant visuals incredible sound design engaging characters and an immersive world i hope we can continue to explore in a part two
Oct 24 2021,positive,very slow main problem however was narrative and the tedious violinhornvoice musing all at the same level    if you cant hear most of the dialogue above the racket you cant follow the plot    advice read the book first and then enjoy the spectacular visuals
Oct 24 2021,positive,it was fantastic i hope they make the second part soon going to be a nail biter wait
Oct 24 2021,positive,i think it was dishonest to not mention that the movie was a multiple part series  i still dont know how many parts there are  from where they left off i am guessing 3 parts for just the 1 book
Oct 24 2021,positive,an absolutely masterpiece im a dune books lover and i was not disappointed at all the book was transposed to film in the best possible way the director fully understood the essence of the story and the atmospheres photography and really fantastic soundtracks i cant wait to see the second part
Oct 24 2021,positive,cant wait to see the rest of the story
Oct 24 2021,negative,put down the zzzquil and melatonin dune is what you need of youre trying to getsome sleep long and slow with the same music that drones on and on and ontrust me its a snoozefest 
Oct 24 2021,positive,the movie was really well done in my opinion overall the graphics cinematography and acting were great it really pulls you into the universe of dune and makes you want to read the books     the only reason id say it isnt 5 stars is that the movie can be very confusing if you dont follow the plot well i think reading the books beforehand would help a ton
Oct 24 2021,positive,this movie is art its rare that a massive effectsfilled blockbuster to hit all the same beats and nuances that an arthouse film would and yet here we are stellar cast beat special effects ive seen so far and incredible cinematography does it feel like half the story yes because it is luckily part 2 has been greenlit so well have the second half in a couple years cant wait
Oct 24 2021,positive,putting frank herberts novel to screen is daunting to say the least this movie stuck true to the book while trimming parts of the story that were necessary for the screen visually stunning i cant wait to see how the story continues to be fleshed out in the next part im glad they decided to do the movie in two parts no way they could do the book justice in one movie truly amazing in imax
Oct 24 2021,positive,if i have one complaint if you havent read the books youre going to be disappoint in how the movie ended and be hoping that they do make a part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,amazing movie very loyal to the source material a cinematic master piece beautiful and does better than i thought possible this is a thoughtful movie with deep plots political intrigue and religion its not a mindless action scifi bring your mind and watch and immerse yourself in this universe this is only part 0ne only the begging such a vast universe lays beyond
Oct 24 2021,negative,awful good cinematography and score no script or character development painful to watch
Oct 24 2021,positive,seriously fing wow exceeded my wildest dreams i have been waiting for this forever this is an absolute masterpiece cinematography sound vision acting cgi love effects just wow wow wow wow wow all day long
Oct 24 2021,positive,absolutely loved it
Oct 24 2021,positive,well done beautiful imagery follows the book very closely
Oct 24 2021,positive,i liked the huge scope of things the interstellar politics was very interesting too super good cast that were all great to watch
Oct 24 2021,negative,had high expectations for this movie the pacing was slow and with the cast i was expecting a great movie non of the actors were used well very disappointed not sure if id want to see a part two after this one
Oct 24 2021,positive,you just have to see it the best sci fi film in an age
Oct 24 2021,positive,things i like   the visuals are spectacular the world is so imaginative futuristic chic and avantgarde in the classic quasidystopian style that villeneuve used for blade runner 2048 i particularly enjoyed the 1 floating light 2 spaceships 3 all the costumes 4 dukes palace 5 suits   hans zimmers score is epic   the cast is loaded here with chalamet zandaya momoa isaac bardem brolin etc the fact that so many get killed off midmovie is quiet the flex from villeneuve   stellan skarsgard stolen every scene as vladimir harkonnen   the use of mystery re jj abrams ted talk about the black box  hiding the full worm or how vladimir harkonnen floats everywhere adds a layer of intrigue to everything   aesthetically and sonically this movie feels built to my tastes     hmmmm   i dont think this movie works as a stand lone film it feels incomplete while im not a screenwriter i think a more satisfaction conclusion might have seen the siege on the palace occur in act three where paul and jessica narrowly escape that way it ends on a high note of them surviving but offers plenty of room to explore the rest of the planet and the fremen society   the use of dreams and visions did not do it for me with one exception everything in the visions came true making the film feel predictable even for someone who hasnt read the book   perhaps for the reasons i listened above but this film had no emotion impact for me i wanted it too i wanted to love this movie that said i was more captivated by the technical accomplishments than any emotional resonance of the plot     verdict  this gets a strong 7 and as of this review the best movie i have seen in 2021 it should rake the technical awards at the oscars and has the potential to become the next star wars
Oct 24 2021,positive,dune exceeded all my expectations taking a deep dive at once might be a path fettered with hurdles but once those names of whos who is set in stone in your mind within the first half an hour the rest of the film is a pleasure ride for cinema lovers it ticks all the right boxes in departments such as set design cinematography visual effects costumes makeup sound and most importantly the music which is hans zimmer at his best the story which is essentially to be concluded in the sequel throws light onto the protagonists evolution from a prince to a duke in exile on the lookout for vengeance justice and reclamation of whats lost to restore the order that his kingdom aspired to establish in the planet arakis it is a bildungsroman and timothee evolves with every scene he is in frankly he is revelation once again each and every scene of the film is elevated by the mastery of the man behind the scenes  dennis villeneuve who already holds an enviable resumé in hollywood and dune only adds to that list of starry films
Oct 24 2021,positive,very intense movie with good characters and a great storyline  if you are just looking for endless action sequences dont waste your time  if you want a movie that is visually pleasing and an on the edge of your seat developing storyline go watch it at the theater  remember this is just part 1 there is a lot of character and storyline development happening here
Oct 24 2021,negative,me and my family had a good nap during the movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,it is true to the novel which is great the cinematography is wonderful the fact that it has to tell the story early on slows it down so you have to be a fan to really appreciate part one well worth watching
Oct 24 2021,positive,really incredible direction cinematography and production design
Oct 24 2021,positive,dune is one of those select films that will live on to define a generation it will join the ranks of films like lord of the rings star wars blade runner all films that bring people together all incredible testaments to the power of film not only as a medium but as a cultural force  dune is an adaptation with the end goal of bringing herberts text to life rather than explaining it it has a great deal of respect for its source material far more so than the majority of adaptations made today this respect can be seen literally all around the board each and every tool is used to immerse you in the story  from a visual and scale the two are nearly one and the same standpoint the film is flawless every image is visceral powerful and jawdropping the sense of pure size it creates is one seldom found in film anymore others that come to mind are films such as lawrence of arabia 2001 aso the prince of egypt etc it truly pays homage not only to the books descriptive language but a bygone era of a fuller cinema the images strike you with potent colors and framing it invokes a largerthanlife feeling  i dont have much to say on a personal level i have virtually no complaints while i prefer arrival for its emotional value dune is certainly a worthy contender for villeneuves best film im docking a few points for some minor expository aspects where i think the book really shines aside from that theres nothing i can say against this film i know ill be rewatching it over and over again each time wishing it were the first  that said please dont watch this on a laptop or a phone experience it on the biggest screen with the loudest speakers you possibly can its worth your money  thanks for reading the book is still better
Oct 24 2021,positive,this is a modern masterpiece
Oct 24 2021,negative,beautiful cinematography but lost me in storyline i just didnt care this must be for people who read the book 
Oct 24 2021,positive,slow and unfinished great acting fun special effects and great soundtrack this bookstory is hard to put on the big screen lots of worktime spent on the back story hopefully part 2 will be made and focus more on the plot and things will speed up 
Oct 24 2021,positive,i only discovered this movie was part one when it started i can live with that but it would have been nice to know ahead of time  im also not pleased with how dark the picture was on screen when compared to the trailers on tv i had quite a bit of difficulty making things out at times maybe this is a cineplex odeon thing but it a consistent theme no matter the live action movie i go see at this theatre chain and very frustrating  the movie itself was very interesting more than enough to prevent me from leaving to use the latrine although i would have appreciated a bit more background on key players
Oct 24 2021,positive,overall a good movie its well acted and well casted my only complaint is the over reliance on the chosen one trope and visions that suck a lot of the tension from the film still will watch part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,denis villeneuves dune is an orgasmic audiovisual experience that will make you long to return to the world of arrakis some people may be bored by the films slow pace but it left me feeling appreciating the time it took to make the content of the dune universe feel digestable for those whove never read the books its truly an experience to behold the cast was great the score by the awesome hans zimmer was great and the costumeworld design felt real and tangible and i hope to hear that part two will be announced so that i can return to arrakis also known as dune
Oct 24 2021,positive,overall it was great there were scenes that took too long
Oct 24 2021,positive,one of the best science fiction movie ever denis villeneuve adaptation of dune is a masterpiece so far the best movie of 2021
Oct 24 2021,positive,obviously the special effects are even better than the first dune  i preferred all of the actors in this one with the exception of pauls mother jessica  i did not want the film to end
Oct 24 2021,positive,the movie was too dark and complicated hard to understand what was going on
Oct 24 2021,positive,great but didnt get far enough into the story  without at least one other release planned this might be a very disappointing tease  for those that know the books even just the first dune novel its almost a wonderful preview   feels like 14 of the story  i would prefer this be an hbo or other service streaming show  this would have made 4 great episodes of 10 or 12 for the book
Oct 24 2021,positive,excellent  cant wait for part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,i dont often give a 55 but dune is beautifully filmed and gorgeous to watch i kid you not the scale of world building is amazing to see it felt and looked real it is slow paced but has to be and has a little action l really had to listen to everything said to piece things together as i know nothing of this world casting is excellent and the soundtrack sooo good put all this together and the movie was epic in scale  i  i personally dont understand why this is released on streaming at the same time as cinema because it really should be watched on the biggest screen if you do watch it i hope you like it as much as i did   summary beautiful sifi
Oct 24 2021,positive,followed the book really well its a must see for sure
Oct 24 2021,positive,amazing leaves you waiting for more
Oct 24 2021,positive,incredible but you must see in the theater or even better imax
Oct 24 2021,positive,the scope and grand scale of it all makes you forgive the somewhat muddled storytelling at times the characters are great along with the acting takes itself very seriously and its a thinking mans blockbuster for sure but would benefit for being a bit more fun the ending is ridiculously abrupt with no resolution to anything thats set up in the 2hr 40min run time but im very excited to see a sequel in 34 yrs
Oct 24 2021,negative,while the movie was interesting it was very disappointing because the story was left unresolved there is no guarantee of a second movie yet so we are left with a story that has no closure we watched on hbo max but if i had to pay for a movie ticket i would have been pissed there are 6 books in the series if hollywood wanted to make more money on the franchise they could have expounded on the story and still finished this one
Oct 24 2021,positive,lets get one thing said this movie is spectacularly stunning visually and audibly       what a feast the first part being world building setting up the story for us to follow the characters are so interesting loved each one and looking forward to the ones to come in part 2     we went to the imax screening so worth it
Oct 24 2021,neutral,the cinematography special effects and music were amazing  but none of that could make up for the incredible slow pace lack of back story and character development  perhaps they feared using many of the story telling techniques that david lynch used in the 1984 dune to cover the gaps from the book to the big screen which somewhat worked back then   who knows  what i do know is that this version doesnt stand on its own  also although the movie had several big names in it they were not used to their maximum potential mis casted  underdeveloped  or both
Oct 24 2021,positive,excellent adoption of the book your immediately sucked into the world that is dune many major stars in this dennis did a great job bringing this to the screen cant wait for the 2nd part definitely see it on the big screen
Oct 24 2021,positive,amazing interpretation of the source material as a book fan it came very close to my imagination of dune beautiful and sounds terrific in imax acting is superb denis killed it
Oct 24 2021,neutral,pretty boring  grand sets and music  felt ready to leave after the 1st hour
Oct 24 2021,positive,dune is breathtaking the visuals and cinematography demand your attention the score by hans zimmer is true to form i had high expectations coming into this move and they were far exceeded i dont know how this movie doesnt win an oscar furthermore the way the movie was adapted from its source material made it very approachable for any audience member amazing
Oct 24 2021,positive,shaping up to be one of the greatest sifi film series of all timeif not the greatest i couldnt recommend this film more ill probably see it at least 2 more times in theater
Oct 24 2021,positive,true cinema most of the key pieces from the novel were addressed looking froward to part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,extremely well done  i read the dune trilogy and have been anxiously awaiting this film   as the last line in the movie stated this is only the beginning
Oct 24 2021,positive,absolutely incredible experience 
Oct 24 2021,positive,beautiful to watch and hear the plot seemed very true to the book as i remember it
Oct 24 2021,positive,the movie was hard to follow at times if i had not been familiar with the story line i probly would have been lost overall i enjoyed the movie and look forward to the sequels
Oct 24 2021,positive,great movie kept to the original story line with a fresh makeover
Oct 24 2021,positive,this movie might not be for everyone but it is an epic masterpiece
Oct 24 2021,negative,what was a good novel has been yet again decimated by the movie industry cgi isnt enough anymore every movie has cgi these days  how about some story plot and acting they had a good book to work with and still manage to flub it up dune is a complete waste of time and resources
Oct 24 2021,negative,boring characters  bad acting  beautiful but stupidly prolonged cinematic cut scenes with awkward poses and blank stares
Oct 24 2021,positive,a true masterpiece which feels fundemental and like a beginng of a long and beautiful story
Oct 24 2021,positive,dune is a truly once in a generation type of film the kind that comes because of a creators unending passion for the source material they are working with which allows for something special to be brought to the big screen
Oct 24 2021,positive,extremely well done so refreshing to have another epic scifi adventure story really hope they make the sequels quickly 
Oct 24 2021,positive,an immersive and cinematic masterpiece villenueve continues to direct absolutely stunning films which will define him for decades a perfect set up for part 2 this film is star wars for grown ups 
Oct 24 2021,positive,visuals and audio were spectacular but the storyline felt very dragged out and extremely slow i felt like the movie couldve been way shorter and i wish they had more action sequences i was a bit underwhelmed and disappointed
Oct 24 2021,positive,the best elements of the book are brought to the screen i cant wait for part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,sound was amazing  movie moved slowly but i will go to part two
Oct 24 2021,positive,saw the movie in imax saturday 23 october  theater was about half full  pretty good given the pandemic i guess    so look  im that guy who read the book for the first time when i was 15 years old im 60 now and have read it at least 10 times since it really is my favorite work of fiction ever and i know that i am not alone  dune is that kind of book    i loathed the 1984 attempt  it was insulting to the source material no other way to say it as a result i was very skeptical about the 2021 effort  that said denis villeneuve is a fantastic director and after being proved wrong about lotr which i thought would never work on screen i gave it a try      the movie as you know only covers the first half of the book and rather rushes it at that  as i watched i kept thinking man if you didnt read the book this would make zero sense but since i did read the book stuff fit i do wish denis had found  a way to explain a few things like the lack of computers which is serious theme in the book and maybe touch on the other houses of the landsraad and how they were part of the story but i know  a single movie is a small space for all that deeper stuff  if you havent read the book it is full of internal dialogue and every chapter starts with an excerpt of a historical document that references what what is going on  add to that the book has multiple appendices that really fleshes things out maybe therell be a directors cut that lasts 4 hours  who knows    so all that said the visuals were great  i particularly liked how the ornithopters were portrayed  very believable the casting was good  and while i really didnt like tim chalamet at first he grew on me in the role  my big problem was rebecca ferguson as the lady jessica  in the book jessica is hard woman  tough as hell very reserved and strong  not the weepy mommy we see in the movie she bugged me  jason issacs crushes it as the duke leto but he kind of crushes everything he does and even jason mamoa was quite good as the great duncan idaho  i really hope that we see this turn into an entire series of movies  a franchies  so wed see him again in dune messiah  zendaya as chani was fine she didnt get much screen time and would play a far bigger part in part two no doubt but she neither thrilled nor repelled me im not a big fan of pop stars as actors so forgive me for not loving her      yes  it ends abruptly yes  it skips over a pile of things that might confuse the snot out of you  if you really want to enjoy the movie either read the book which is huge but certainly worth it or find any number of cliffs notes on the internet to understand a few important things the holzman effect the bultlerian jihad what a suk doctor is and what a mentat is  all of that would help understand some of the more confusing bits    but i liked it ill see 2 should it get made
Oct 24 2021,neutral,i was really excited to see this movie with my teenage kids this past weekend however to my satisfaction i wasnt a fan of this one the plot of the movie was hard to follow if you havent already read the book  it had some slow action scenes lets just say this was 2 hours 35 minutes i will never get back  sorry if youre a fan of dune
Oct 24 2021,negative,the movie was boring until the fighting started way into the movie this movie   is so  overhyped
Oct 24 2021,positive,if you did not read the book you might be lost from time to time they changed one character from male to female which made no sense there was too much whispering so it was hard to follow the dialog
Oct 24 2021,positive,started out slow but then picked up on the action pretty awesome
Oct 24 2021,positive,i was worried that couldnt understand the plot as i didnt read the book but good job on their story telling part  they made it understandable by the audience    great composition and cg use amazing background music
Oct 24 2021,positive,visuals and storytelling were sublime
Oct 24 2021,positive,faithful to the book and the story line was easy to follow
Oct 24 2021,positive,this movie was huge well worth the imax ticket faithful to the source material without bogging down anywhere in its runtime looking forward to part two
Oct 24 2021,positive,took too long to get to the action slow movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,dune was really well done and faithful to the book which i read recently it had great sound music and cinematography the next one will be even better 
Oct 24 2021,positive,having read books and seen earlier productions id say this was a nearperfect film
Oct 24 2021,positive,ive read all the books so i could understand the slow beginning i thought it was excellent and very close to the first dune book i truly hope that the movie does well so there is a part 2 and beyond highest rating for this adaptation
Oct 24 2021,positive,epic and pretty true to the source material it is unfortunate that they havent even started filming part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,best adaptation of a science fiction classic see it on a big acreen
Oct 24 2021,neutral,a visually ravishing movie that unlike the original movie fails to portray alien worlds in any genuine way the aesthetic is too human too sterile too homogenous and imagery was far too repetitive  the harkonnens should have been filthy deprived and perverse but we had a fat man in a steam room or an oily bath the atreides owned a planet but lived in grey cells  the movie was not gritty enough and just like his other movies velleneuves attention to prop and costume detail is weak that bull statue  are we in spain or space  dune is the tenet of scifi slick but ultimately unfulfilling
Oct 24 2021,positive,remains to be seen whether the finale will hold the rest together treads lightly on religious material lines simplified from the book atmospheric blend between lynch  scifi version
Oct 24 2021,positive,such an amazing and beautiful film with a huge incredible cast gets me very excited for part 2 hoping it gets made and very soon as well
Oct 24 2021,positive,dune was fast paced and kept me engaged in the movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,i cant believe its here but now we wait five years for a sequel this movie is ridiculously awesome in tone scale sound and sight you might now believe the astounding beauty that this movie is and how it plants you right in the middle of this dense and rich story i highly recommend seeing it in the biggest and loudest theater you can find after years of cookie cutter marvel movies its great to have a franchise that is fresh and you can feel the stakes and if you havent read the book then youre in for a big ride because dune the movie doesnt disappoint but going further we really get dune part 2 and dune messiah and dennis can deliver like he did with this first installment we need to brace ourselves
Oct 24 2021,negative,no doubts the sound and image are amazing but there is no character development nor motivation for a 2 hr 30 min movie there is no time for character motivations the intrigue you dont feel carried by the story thinks append for some reason and people react  long story short boring
Oct 24 2021,positive,finally an epic scifi movie we want to see
Oct 24 2021,positive,i have seen dune at the cinema twice now once at the bfi imax in london   this must be what it felt like to watch lawrence of arabia for the first time on the big screen this is why we go to the cinema to be astounded to wonder and to be moved several scenes stood out for me and what became very clear on my second viewing was how you could actually see the thought process of the characters  outstanding performances stunning visuals what a masterpiece to denis villeneuve the cast and the whole crew thank you and bravo bravo
Oct 24 2021,positive,the visuals and background were amazing but i didnt really like the movie because of its slow paced screenplay and i felt it was similar to star wars the casting and their performance were pretty good
Oct 24 2021,positive,did i just witness a masterpiece akin to peter jacksons lotr trilogy it was refreshing to get transported back to my youth when i would imagine what these places and characters were like to not have to go watch a film and have the world outside the theatre dragged in behind me was refreshing all of the characters appear to have been excellently cast everything about this film is intense and jarring making you feel you too are in this fight but it was when the sardaukar were introduced that i felt something i had never felt watching a film before dread real freaking dread this is a work of art and ranks among the best films i have ever scene the way music and sound was used sometimes subtle sometimes like a battle axe to your gut the cinematography was gorgeous the sets everything this was the dune that felt right i dont even know what im saying there could be so much to say i am sure that time will come and many will celebrate this film in video essays and the like for now just go watch the movie
Oct 24 2021,negative,2 and a half hours of seeing zendaya in slow motion while its lacking vital information in order to understand the plot if you havent read the books a total fail
Oct 24 2021,positive,spectacular journey great cast looking forward to the next one
Oct 24 2021,positive,its being compared to star wars  lord of the rings but theres no r2d2c3po humor or sweet funny moments with gandalf or halflings its just ominous more ominous loud ominous ominous with a worm and ominous for hours it needed to be balanced like those movies were able to do
Oct 24 2021,positive,this might be denis villeneuves best work so far the visuals the set design  the vfx are so polished that they really bring the universe of dune to life this is essentially game of thrones in space  however this is merely a small glimpse of the possibilities of dune and thus feels hollow as the movie is only part one of however many its a beautiful movie with some solid acting and a highly polished set cant understate the costumesetsvfx etc but without a proper sequel this movie becomes less recommedadble
Oct 24 2021,positive,denis villeneuve is at the absolute peak of the filmmaking game and this first installment sets the perfect tone for a second part or entire franchise of beloved films an instant classic as they say the passion for this story oozes out of every frame and performance
Oct 24 2021,negative,very slow you loose interest
Oct 24 2021,positive,a must see not only for the fans but an amazing film frank herbert movies make me dream as a kid and this movie makes me shivers as a grow up for me the best movie of the year hanz zimmer ty sir
Oct 24 2021,positive,this is the dune movie ive been waiting 37 years to see
Oct 24 2021,positive,one of the best films of this year and the last decade
Oct 24 2021,positive,so much to look at sounds massive enjoyment
Oct 24 2021,positive,a very solid foundation for a trilogy while slow in nature this is absolutely necessary in introducing characters and building plot lines
Oct 24 2021,positive,im a big fan of frank herberts dune  i had been anxiously awaiting the release of this movie and i can honestly say that im not disappointed  even if i had not read the book the cinematography alone is a reason the see this movie  i feel like the movie does a decent job staying true to the novel honestly theres just too much detail in the novel to ever really be able to convey it all in film  whether or not youre a fan of the book this film is definitely a must see
Oct 24 2021,negative,waste of time and money like bro theres no action or nothing but aye at least theres good actors
Oct 24 2021,neutral,not a fan of this version of dune felt it was too rushed and some of the most important aspects of the book political religious were removed in favor of cinematic effects very little baron guild was almost nonexistent and they are some of the most fascinating characters in the dune universe  no feyd or irulan either i can see many aspectsof br 2049 in this movie and i liked br 2049 better
Oct 24 2021,positive,the film is spectacular incredible show stopping amazing totally unique never the same excellent is everything i want to watch it again what i disliked is i have to wait for the 2nd part
Oct 24 2021,neutral,less than average attempt with the tech and actors available too much mood music actors brought personalities from other films they had been in  to this film should have tried to be different   somewhat boring maybe next time
Oct 24 2021,positive,so my friends and i saw dune tonight believe the hype this is probably one of the best scifi movies ive ever seen i can honestly say it was a spiritual experience watching this movie i hadnt felt like this since the first time i watched the lord of the rings or the first time i saw avatar in theaters its that good this is really an incredible film we saw it in imax and thats really the best way to see it go see this film its incredible im still absorbing it its just really amazing
Oct 24 2021,positive,exceptional movie one of the few i would watch again and again i really hope they green light sequels and perhaps the other novels asap amazing casting
Oct 24 2021,negative,i was a big fan of the books as a kid and i wanted to share those experiences with my preteen son as we watched this film  he shared my excitement as i named off the characters and their significance this lasted for 12 an hour before we both found ourselves blankly staring at the screen while groups in the audience began silently standing up and walking out never to return  my son eventually dozed off as i swore to myself that i would never torcher him again by watching the sequel
Oct 24 2021,positive,visual excellent acting is terrific my only concern is if one did not read the book one might be confused at times
Oct 24 2021,positive,amazing take on this story and one that finally does the book justice  one of the better book to movie adaptions out there although there are differences  no movie is going to do it 100 correct but for the amount of material in the book this movie retains most of it   the important scenes are all there and well done but some of the subtleties that flesh out the rest of the story are kinda glossed over or are so subtle anyone who didnt read the book wouldnt understand       the pacing also seemed a little quick too even though the movie is 25 hours in length      overall it was amazing watched it 3 times already once in imax twice on hbo
Oct 24 2021,negative,sooooo boring almost feel asleep when i was watching and that never happens when im at the movies
Oct 24 2021,positive,i read the book last december and was blown away by herberts genius denis villeneuve has cemented his spot on the hall of fame for cinema as one of its greatest champions  everything was perfectly done the sound effects were new and original the score by hans zimmer was brilliant the actors couldnt be more perfect for the roles i am very happy and satisfied with the way the movie came out
Oct 24 2021,positive,in 10191 ag duke leto i oscar isaac of house atreides ruler of the ocean planet caladan is assigned by the padishah emperor shaddam iv to serve as fief ruler of arrakis a harsh desert planet and the only source of melange or spice a priceless substance that extends human vitality and is critical for interstellar travel house atreides are to replace the house harkonnen who have withdrawn from arrakis on shaddams orders in reality seeing house atreides as a threat to his own power shaddam intends to use his sardaukar troops to eradicate house atreides and stage a coup to allow house harkonnen to retake the planet shortly after their arrival leto is apprehensive of the assignment but sees it as an opportunity to bond with arrakis native population the fremen as a first step to bring peace throughout all the houses letos concubine lady jessica rebecca ferguson is an acolyte of the bene gesserit an exclusive sisterhood who wield advanced physical and mental abilities jessica was instructed to bear a daughter as part of the gesserits breeding program to create the kwisatz haderach a messianic superbeing but for her love for leto she bore a son paul timothée chalamet throughout his life paul is trained by letos aides duncan idaho jason momoa gurney halleck josh brolin and the mentat thufir hawat stephen mckinley henderson while jessica trains paul in bene gesserit disciplines beginning before house atreides arrival on arrakis paul is troubled by visions of a mysterious girl and a future where he leads a violent holy war sharing his dreams only with jessica and duncan because of these visions the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam comes to caladan and subjects paul to the gom jabbar a deadly test to assess its subjects humanity which he passes afterwards mohiam instructs house patriarch baron vladimir harkonnen stellan skarsgård to spare paul and jessica during his forthcoming coup which he deceitfully agrees to leto jessica and paul travel

the desert during a flight with paul halleck and kynes they witness a sandworm attack an active harvester leto helps rescue its crew before the sandworm swallows it during which paul inhales the spiceladen air causing his visions to intensify    rotten tomatoes consensus reads dune occasionally struggles with its unwieldy source material but those issues are largely overshadowed by the scope and ambition of this visually thrilling adaptation following its premiere at the venice film festival reception was generally positive but did not resonate with some critics summarizing early reviews stephen m colbert of screen rant noted that its complex story and villeneuves directorial style were bound to have selective appeal and that this is reflected in negative reviews thus far the film has been praised for its scope and ambition ben travis of empire magazine gave the film five out of five stars and stated an absorbing aweinspiringly huge adaptation of half of frank herberts novel that will wow existing acolytes and get newcomers hooked on its spicefuelled visions if part two never happens itll be a travesty robbie collin of the daily telegraph also gave the film a fivestar rating calling it majestic unsettling and enveloping xan brooks of the guardian referred to the film in his fivestar review as dense moody and quite often sublime  the missing link bridging the multiplex and the arthouse in a positive review justin chang of the los angeles times wrote villeneuve draws you into an astonishingly vivid sometimes plausibly unnerving vision of the future leah greenblatt of entertainment weekly who graded the film a b wrote that dune is exactly the kind of lush lofty filmmaking wide screens were made for a sensory experience so opulent and overwhelming it begs to be seen big or not at all and added the sheer awesomeness of villeneuves execution  often obscures the fact that the plot is mostly prologue a sprawling origin story with no fixed beginning or end other critics commented on issues related to pacing and handling of the source material critic owen gleiberman of variety wrote its an act of worldbuilding that runs out of storytelling steam  dune is out to wow us and sometimes succeeds but it also wants to get under your skin like a hypnotically toxic mosquito  as the movie begins to run out of tricks it turns woozy and amorphous kevin maher of the times gave two out of five stars stating that while every frame  is spectacular dune is also kind of boring reviewing the film for thewrap steve pond called the film both dazzling and frustrating often spectacular and often slow and said this version of dune sometimes feels as if it aims to impress you more than entertain you its grim on a staggering level ditching most of the fun of scifi yarns in favor of a worldview that feels more like villeneuves sicario or prisoners than his arrival    so finally we have denis villeneuves dune titled onscreen as dune part one here after having been pushed back a year it is the first of a planned twopart adaptation of the 1965 novel of the same name by frank herbert primarily covering the first half of the book  the film stars an ensemble cast including timothée chalamet rebecca ferguson oscar isaac josh brolin stellan skarsgård dave bautista stephen mckinley henderson zendaya david dastmalchian chang chen sharon duncanbrewster charlotte rampling jason momoa and javier bardem dune has been considered an unfilmable work due to its breadth and complexity of plots and prior attempts such as david lynchs 1984 film did not perform well with critics following a failed attempt by paramount pictures to produce a new adaptation of herberts novel legendary entertainment acquired film and tv rights to the science fiction novel dune in 2017 development began shortly after with villeneuve expressing interest in the project and officially signing on as director in january 2017 he worked with roth and spaihts to write the screenplay breaking it into two parts and incorporating an updated 21st century adaptation of the 1965 novel shortly after publication in 1965 dune was identified for potential film prospects and the rights to adapt the novel to film have been held by several producers since 1971 multiple attempts to make such a film have been made and it was considered to be unfilmable a difficult work to adapt to the screen owing to its breadth of content further because of the books status among passionate fans any deviations from the original material without strong justification have the potential to harm the films reputation filmmaker alejandro jodorowsky had acquired the rights in the 1970s to make an extravagant fourteenhour adaptation of the book but the project fell apart this effort to make the film was later the subject of the documentary film jodorowskys dune released in 2013 david lynchs dune produced by raffaella de laurentiis in 1984 was intended to be a threehour film but was forced to be cut to 137 minutes for release and as a result the film was poorly received and considered a misfire a liveaction miniseries frank herberts dune aired on the sci fi channel in 2000 it did well in viewership and was generally better received than lynchs film however some reviewers criticized the miniseries for lacking the spectacle afforded to a feature film production and for staying too faithful to the book and thus getting dragged down by exposition prospects to make a successful adaptation of dune came after the criticallyacclaimed adaptions of the lord of the rings and harry potter both which maintained most of the works key characters and plots while managing the limited running time in 2008 paramount pictures were developing a new feature film adaptation of frank herberts dune with peter berg set to direct berg left the project in october 2009 with director pierre morel brought on to direct in january 2010 before paramount dropped the project in march 2011 as they could not come to key agreements with their rights expiring back to rubinstein how is villeneuves vision of dune then i personally think that its a visual masterpiece that matches the books massive scope and universe with an excellent cast and magnificent cinematography and visuals but the first part misses the complexity of the book to my mind this part is a bit too straightforward but then again this is only part one i do assume that villeneuve will take us into those complex sections in part two however i would say that you need to have red frank herberts dune to enjoy this adaptation fully as this film becomes the perfect complement to the book read the book and then emerse yourself in the film
Oct 24 2021,positive,a waking dream and a powerful and visionary adaptation that does true justice to the source material i will be seeing this again and again the spice must flow and so must part two
Oct 24 2021,positive,faithful to dune original story
Oct 24 2021,positive,i really liked part one the movie has a good story going so far  there is action and drama  excellent acting and i cant wait to see how the rest of the story unfolds
Oct 24 2021,negative,took a horrible movie and made it even worse
Oct 24 2021,positive,the visuals and score were amazing and it really does transport you into a completely different world it felt unlike anything ive ever seen before in a good way loved the story and its totally meant to be experienced on the big screen
Oct 24 2021,positive,this is the adaptation weve been waiting for
Oct 24 2021,positive,the movie was really good the cgi is fucking crazy
Oct 24 2021,positive,wow mr villenueve did a masterful job and his vision is amazing in building this world for us in addition the cast of actorsactresses was stellar as an avid moviegoer since the 1960s i cant tell you how pleasing it is to finally have some quality material released into the movie theaters in this restrictive covid world weve been living hopefully this is a precursor of good things to come in 2022 my only complaint was sometimes the dialogue was whispered and you almost needed close captions to be able to figure out what was being uttered missing key parts of the story because of the sound of  vocals could confuse people that dont have a background in  dune lore a regardless cant wait for the second one
Oct 24 2021,positive,breathtaking is a word that describes dune part one perfectly well    its just a breathtaking beautiful movie from start to finish incredible screenplay cast cinematography production design vfx stunts costumes sound direction and score once again hans zimmer has created an immersive soundtrack that sucks you into the mesmerising world of dune its the perfect accompaniment to denis villeneuves masterfully created motion picture    the final this is only the beginning scene will have you leave the cinema full of awe and wonder completely satisfied and wanting for a sequel days later and im still reflecting on the marvel that is dune part one    desert power indeed
Oct 24 2021,positive,my experience with the movie not reading the books i found it extremely boring and found a few people fell asleep during it however i did take someone that read the books and found it a good tie in movie to the books maybe this just wasnt for me but i prefer movies with more action also warning many scenes with many bright scenes that can be very overwhelming
Oct 24 2021,positive,dune a  watching this in imax will always be something i will remember the cinematography was outstanding in this film the story may seem complex on the onset but this film does an impressive job of making it relatively digestible this world is massive and the set up here was very detailed and well constructed i havent seen a film casted so well in a long time timothee chalamet is a certified a lister for me now the movie really has no flaws in terms of plot and storytelling even though the movie is long in length it doesnt make you lose interest and rather this length helps to provide a very solid foundation for sequels that is my only complaint about this whole movie that if there is no sequel this movie will feel like a massive what could have been film franchise we need a sequel to this movie people please support it and watch it on the biggest screen possible this movie was an unforgettable journey and a world i want to continue to explore this franchise could be as elite as lord of the rings and star wars it may even have the best first film out of the three franchises nothing but praise here this is my kind of entertainment the one that transports and makes you feel
Oct 24 2021,positive,i watched dune in imax today and i was shaking as i walked out of the theatre its a visceral experience and needs to be experienced on the biggest screen possible the greatest compliment i can give it is it reminds me of lotr the scale of this film is absolutely extraordinary and the way denis villeneuve directs this with that incredible sound direction really immerses you into the world     going in i didnt know anything about dune and now im thirsting for more and cant wait for the second part
Oct 24 2021,positive,i dont usually write reviews but when i tell you this movie is beyond incredible i mean it i was blown away with every aspect of this movie the acting the music the cinematography everything was so perfect i fell in love with this movie right away 
Oct 24 2021,positive,a beautifully scenic and stunning movie dune doesnt disappoint
Oct 24 2021,positive,dune was a very good movie and well put together this story has always been a 710 aswell as the book going off of the 1984 dune this is 100 better i have rated 35 stars because i honestly wasnt happy on how much talking there was then acting at some points of the movie i felt like someone threw a flash bang at my face overall watch the movie its good 
Oct 24 2021,positive,very well adapted from the book i think some parts could be difficult to grasp if you havent read the book but there is enough in the visual department alone to warrant a watch
Oct 24 2021,positive,great adaptation stunning shots good acting was in awe the whole movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,this movie is fantastic i was totally intrigued the entire time watching this movie the cast cinematography and visual effects are all amazing one of director denis villeneuves best movies hans zimmer did a stellar job with the films music score cant wait for part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,dune is a cinematic experience unlike anything ive ever seen its truly a perfect movie and easily denis villeneuves masterpiece its a stunning achievement a modern art blockbuster and left me stunned in silence and awe when it ended i grinned the whole way through and wanted to give the movie a standing ovation after it completely shattered all my expectations and i was already very excited for this i loved it its easily one of the coolest things ive ever seen and one of my favourite experiences ive ever had watching a movie its a perfect translation of the book and handles the complex lore so well villeneuve and his screenwriters clearly understand and adore the source material they found a way to recreate scenes exactly how the book describes them it was surprising how well scenes seemed to play exactly how i imagined they would the movie handles the world building and exposition stunningly well and i loved that the script didnt dumb down the story and maintains the intelligence of the novel blending the themes of religion politics power nobility betrayal and ecology in such impressive ways im so happy someone found a way to finally successfully translate this complex story to the screen after hollywoods many failed attempts i never thought it could be done with this much perfection and majesty the story is very dense and has a lot of moving pieces but i like that the film doesnt spoon feed it to the audience and lets us interpret many elements for ourselves it trusts us to follow along with the story although i do wonder how hard it would be to follow without a preexisting understanding of the novel the plot is gripping and moves really fast especially once you let yourself just be absorbed into the atmosphere of the film the characters are all so rich and unique and the cast is freaking incredible everyone brings their agame especially the brooding timothee chalamet who until now i havent really been a fan of he is perfect as paul he really becomes the character and he delivers a masterful performance with such a range of emotions and subtleties i also thought rebecca ferguson was the best shes been in years but the true star of this movie is truly denis villeneuve he masterfully directs this film ensuring every element is crafted to its highest potential the film is hypnotic atmospheric and visceral massive and epic in scale and has excellent world building and production design what i also love is that while villeneuve embraces such a massive scope he never sacrifices character to do so as this is a very character and relationship driven film but wow is it ever an incredibly cinematic film it feels like an oldschool hollywood epic like lawrence of arabia and much like that film it is an ode to the desert like that film the cinematography in this movie is beyond beautiful its gorgeous to look at and frames scenes in such creative perfect ways it just jaw droopingly good the movie is worth seeing for the visual experience alone its a feast for the eyes the lighting is also really well done and helps to make the cgi look as good as it can villeneuve also cleverly grounds the cgi by shooting as much practically and in camera as he can and it pays off it just all looks excellent the sets are intricately detailed and massive the costuming is wonderfully intricate and it all comes together to create a world that really feels lived in the action is sparse as this is more of a drama focused scifi but when it happens its extremely well choreographed and shot to create intense gritty fightbattle scenes the attack on the atreides is easily a highlight or even duncans hallway fight too now all these visual elements are excellently accentuated by the incredible sound design the mix is one of the deepest and most complex i have ever heard from hans zimmers incredible score to sound effects such as the voice power zimmer also crafted one of his best most unique and detailed scores that fits the movie perfectly its just such a unique auditory experience and combined with the stunning visuals it just created such a sense of euphoria in my head as my senses were overwhelmed with the world of dune this is a movie that you would be doing a disservice to yourself by watching it at home it must be seen on the biggest screen you can find such as imax its just such an incredible experience that truly reminded me why i love cinema and going to the movies its feels like a mix of star wars and game of thrones which i love and yet this story predates and possibly inspired both i cannot wait to see more from this world and i really hope we get the 2nd part of the story made ultimately i have absolutely no issues with this perfect piece of cinema on a technical level this movie is flawless and has so much attention to detail and that is all because of the master himself denis villeneuve who crafted it with so much love care but most importantly skill its a true cinematic treasure and gave me the same feelings as the first time i saw star wars or lord of the rings i smiled the whole way through dune is a stunning majestic achievement and easily the best film that has come out all year i highly recommend seeing this in theatres and experiencing this massive epic cinematic masterpiece for yourself
Oct 24 2021,negative,im truly shocked by the number of people who actually like this garbage its an almost 3 hour movie that doesnt even have a satisfying ending but a cliffhanger so it could end in a second movie to me thats the laziest way to end a movie to end a movie and if you want to make a sequel make it ambiguous and so the audience that say oh whats next but also think dang thats it and make them believe thats the end but then secretly have a sequel that the pacing was very slow and i legit wanted to fall asleep due to its long long runtime ive never seen the original 1980 something dune but now i want to to see if its somewhat better than this garbage the acting is very bland and not really anything its just monotone nonsense i get that this movie was attempting to be the next big franchise but in my eyes this is not it but i am surprised by how many people actually enjoy this movie maybe because of this whole lockdown thing people have no taste i dont know but i have no clue how people could last 3 hours in a theater im so glad this was on hbo max and i could barely make it through the first hour and 45 minutes after that i had to take a break aka 2 hours to then have the patience to sit through the rest in the end this movie couldve been something with better acting better writing and thats it this movie looks like a huge spectacle i bet warner brothers spent a lot of money on this and it shows the only compliment i could give this movie is it looks fantastic but unfortunately this movie doesnt amount to anything and will be in the 5 bin at walmart either this black friday or the next year after that if they ever make a dune part 2 ill possibly scream but not in joy but rather in anger a little joke at the end anyway hopefully another movie never happens but maybe it could hollywood is full of surprises
Oct 24 2021,positive,the casting of this movie is great  i have never read the book but still really enjoyed this movie  i am really looking forward to the second part as this one was definitely the set up for what is to come next but it was a very good set up
Oct 24 2021,positive,good adaptation of the book so far i like that they are only doing one part per movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,dune is a one of a kind visual spectacle i know now what people in the past wouldve felt when they saw 2001 a space odyssey or lawrence of arabia on the big screen for the first time every shot is filled with grandeur and beauty when it comes to the narrative the film takes its time to introduce us to the world and its characters the slow building can put off some people but once the film gets going in the second half its a treat the film has the emotional depth of a cardboard and despite timothee chalamats superb performance we dont really care for his journey this cold nature of the narrative as often with villeneuves films is a byproduct of the extremely formal approach towards the story apart from that its no denying that villeneuve has proved yet again that hes one of the best filmmakers out there
Oct 24 2021,positive,grrrreat friggin movie from start to finish the cinematics were awesome highly recommend seeing it
Oct 24 2021,positive,this movie is a must see on a big screen its one of the best made scifi movies ive ever seen finally this great book gets its great movie i hate having to wait for the next one 
Oct 24 2021,positive,i read dune as a teen the book immerses you in a foreign and complex world it could be slow but it sticks to you like tar and your soul never seems the same again     so if you love the books know that villeneuve didnt just transcribe the book to film but as an artist faithfully interpreted the source material while respecting film as a medium and the world today  i couldnt give it a better review it is the best book adaptation ever of any book    if you never read the book it explains what is needed along the way but barely youll have to think while watching it the file is slower but paced purposefully and filled with amazing cinematography that truly captivates if it doesnt get the oscar here ill call bs must see    so my one complaint is it is really half a book and it does lack the payoff one would expect in  film i understand a 45 hour movie isnt economically feasible in todays world is this a complaint kind of but im beyond excited for the sequel
Oct 24 2021,positive,such a masterpiece another great direction by villeneuve definitely rewatching arrival tonight 
Oct 24 2021,negative,whilst it is visually stunning the story is a slow burner and hard to follow
Oct 24 2021,negative,too long repetitive scenes the end of the movie was disappointing
Oct 24 2021,positive,absolutely fantastic
Oct 24 2021,positive,a very closely accurate portrayal of the frank herbert book dune published in 1965 amazing visuals amazing musical score amazing acting go see it in theaters
Oct 24 2021,positive,i just saw dune in the theater and it was a mesmerizing intense and grandiose experience i loved every second of it and i will go watch it a second time it was a feast for the eyes ears and everything else i cant wait for part ii go experience it as soon as you can
Oct 24 2021,positive,we loved this movie at the imax theater  beautiful well written well acted excellent storyline much better than the original mini series   a gorgeous movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,wow that was storytelling at its finest replete with backstory and laying the groundwork as someone who has not read the books or seen the movie from the 80si can say i am impressed for whatever thats worth and now compelled to read the books lets talk cast timothee chalamet is quickly becoming one of my favorites loved him in the king his subtle nuances bring a richness and depth that draws you in oscar isaac is brilliant as always and 3 marvel actors is pretty much a guarantee itll be good i cannot wait for the next film rise
Oct 24 2021,positive,everything i wanted dune to be and more greenllight part 2 now
Oct 24 2021,positive,great cinematography
Oct 24 2021,negative,boring  easily the worst adaptation yet 
Oct 24 2021,positive,in short good pacing great cast and technically a visual masterpiece never once felt like things were dragging out amazing performances by the cast and makes the audience work to understand rewarding us for connecting the dots wasnt unfamiliar with dune before this movie i didnt not have much expectations going into to my first watchill be going back for a second viewing very much a part one but for the first time in more than a decade i cant help but get vibes and feelings similar to to those when i first watched lotr matrix and star wars 
Oct 24 2021,positive,not my type of movie but good images and all i easily got bored 
Oct 24 2021,positive,all in all dune is an excellent example of slow paced political scifi its definitely not for everybody but it was personally one of the best theater going experiences ive had in a long time equal parts super intriguing plot and all out spectacle there wasnt a moment i wasnt hanging onto every next moment this particular adaptation of dune is one of the rare movies that just keeps going and feels like forever yet once it was over i didnt want it to be this film takes a level in world building and just overall unfolding of plot that i can only assume is just pure bliss for hardcore fans of the book series it really made me want to pick them up myself actually especially seeing that we unfortunately might not get a second part of what is only the first book
Oct 24 2021,positive,pretty darn good its a nice bridge between the original movie and the booktv series as far as detail and wow it is a gorgeous movie i am having a hard time seeing the zendaya casting as chani but a lot of great acting despite the massive amount of material there are parts that feel a little too slow but very worth seeing
Oct 24 2021,positive,almost enough to make you forget that david lynch pos cant wait for part 2
Oct 24 2021,neutral,visually superb  great score  the theater i was in had the sound cranked to 11 so it sometimes drowned out the dialogue  i could not even pick out the fear manta  overall the movie lacked energy  even with the knife fight near the finish  it dragged while trying to speed things along so i felt like the entire concept of the imperium the battling houses spice etc was glossed over so hard  this turned into a bad clone of a michael bey action movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,its hard to argue that this is anything but a new standard set for cinematography for a book that has historically been judged as impossible to adapt for the big screen it not only is well done and true to the book but communicates this universe in a way that is nothing shy of awe inspiring
Oct 24 2021,positive,this movie was everything i ever wanted in a dune movie vieually stunning very strong actors solemn and slow paced storytelling all wrapped in a sumptuous soundtrack also seeing the ornithopter made my internal 7 yo playing dune game in the 90s cry a little
Oct 24 2021,positive,most importantly it was true to the source material telling this iconic story in an exciting yet familiar way  excellent production and visualizations so many good acting moments again and again music score was supportive in a way ive not seen in recent films
Oct 24 2021,positive,can you imagine what kind of taste you must have not to recommend this movie even if you just thought it was okay like how can you say this is worse than a b this should be 100 recommended gotta go read these naysayers reviews for some laughs
Oct 24 2021,positive,a masterpiece true to the storyline with modern analogs of political treachery the star wars generation  who seldom read and with little patience will never comprehend the depth and meaning of such a novel
Oct 24 2021,negative,my review on this movie is two fold one as a stand alone flick and the other a comparison to the original movie not the book   compared to the original movie the cinematography is superior as to be expected but they spend a lot of time showing you just how great the cinematography is unnecessarily so with scenes that could have been much more concise yet still as powerful  the use of scenery and visuals draw out the running time and slow the story progression with adding little value  the acting quality and dialog for the leads paul jessica is poor  ferguson does what she can with whats written but chalamet is reminiscent of the wooden hayden christianson    issac who usually does excellent work is somewhat stilted by the dialog though he is passable   the two who shine here are mamoa and brolin   mamoa thrives in the role and is must watch in every scene hes in even the non action ones  brolin also delivers his dialog with a punch as good as his action scenes   overall the script seems stilted slow and forced except when mamoa and brolin are on screen  bautista is believable as the beast raban but there is little for him in this movie   overall a moribund script pounding score with no real life to it poor acting from the main character does not make it worth a three hour time suck but if youre watching at home fast forward to the scenes with mamoa and brolin  then put on the 1984 version and enjoy
Oct 24 2021,positive,the imax make it much better
Oct 24 2021,positive,having read the 1965 book in college and watched the 1984 movie theatrical and the various edits and the 2000 syfy miniseries this by far is the best versión of the story so far half of it anyway the massive novel is distilled into something that flows well brings gravitas to the struggle of the young man who in part 2if they greenlight it will both be the messiah to a planetful of desert dwellers and the force that will bring down an empire that rules the galaxyyeah george lucas did borrow parts of this story to flesh out star wars please make part 2 discovery networks who just bought warner from atti must also mention this movie has the most diverse well chosen cast ever assembled for a film
Oct 24 2021,positive,what an amazing spectacle this movie is a must see  but beware its only part 1 and part 2 is not even confirmed yet so in practicality this is just part of a movie of which we might never get to see ontinues or concludes and even if there will be a part 2 it would take atleast 3 years to arrive 
Oct 24 2021,positive,great movie from the visuals to the story acting and sound this flick had just about everything going for it while i could see some viewers getting bored at times i was sucked in from the start and stayed that way until the end this is coming from someone that new more or less what was going to happen the ending definitely leaves you wanting more but this was never billed as more than part 1 of a 2 part movie i went to support it in the theater and im glad its available for me to watch again on the streaming service
Oct 24 2021,neutral,started off slow hard to follow
Oct 24 2021,positive,the epitome of modern day cinema sci fi
Oct 24 2021,positive,i cant wait for the next one
Oct 24 2021,negative,sorry  but i am not understanding all these people that are giving this movie 5 stars i dont understand it was loooong and boooooringand the plot is a bit sloppy to prove it we started out with a theater of approx 60 people and i saw at least 6 people that walked out in the first hour which was the movies weakest part as it picked up a bit after the hour mark but not enough to make it past the c dgrade this movie is booooooring you have been warned
Oct 24 2021,positive,its a bit of a slow burn and intended to be more than one part but its one of the most visually impressive movies ive seen in years
Oct 24 2021,positive,while dunes terminology rich lore and the speediness at which it is delivered usually while there is a lot of eye candy and intense music happening may not be for everyone i think most could agree that it is a visualaudial experience like no other and i personally feel that its one of the best science fiction films ever made  the creative energy behind dune is palpable as is evident with each shot  everything from shipstech to the environmental storytelling awesome charactersvillains and stunning cinematographyset pieces really transport you to the storys universe in a way i dont think any science fiction film has ever done for me  the bassy drumlines and striking heart stopping vocals of the soundtrack also give moments an epic punch to them i was shooketh  sometimes however i felt the loud music overpowered important dialogue and was present in scenes that didnt need it  by the end the effect kind of wore off a bit as a result and i think a lot of people might miss some classic lines from the book  granted this may only be a problem in imax perhaps in normal theaters the sound is more balanced or maybe some speakers in my theater were out but if anything the issue will be easily remedied with home theater systems  despite this however the audio experience is generally phenomenal and the film is absolutely worth experiencing in an imax theater if you can would highly recommend as it was super immersive  casting choices are on point with skaarsgard delivering an amazing performance as the baron chalamet crushing it as usual and ferguson portraying jessica beautifully  everyone else does an amazing job too but they stood out to me  again the film delivers a lot of lore very quickly while dazzling with its visual and audial splendor so its easy to miss things everyone i went with found it hard to follow at times  i personally felt that the lore and universal politics at play were presented quite nicely for how complex it is in the source text i never felt dragged down by it but it does come fast  motivation for a secondthird viewing if anything  it definitely might not be as accessible as star wars marvel or lotr but i think theres a lot to enjoy here for general audiences especially in the visual and sound its just a lot to injest and may seem slowconvoluted for some  the same can be said about lots of classic science fiction though  i think if part two does as good of a job as part one it could be the best body of sci fi cinema ever  for me it was a perfect adaptation and took me back to how it felt reading the book when i was younger  it surpassed my expectations i was honestly mind blown but im trying to be objective here  not everything makes it into this theatrical release but all the important bits seem to be present and im sure there is a lot more to come in part 2  im already beyond excited
Oct 24 2021,positive,its sooooo goood i really go to the cinema with low standars but the movie work so fantastic the soundtrack the filmography the art design ad other things really make the movie so unique
Oct 24 2021,negative,slow and boring the dialog was so muddled i had to turn on closed captioning strictly for fans of the book
Oct 24 2021,positive,ive seen both adaptations and this one is great for scifi fans those wanting answers will have to do their research on what is going on the 1984 movie and books help in that regard what i like about dune is that it is a future based on our history and involvement with artificial intelligence the acting is superb the audio and visuals are  1010 the story is the mystery and is worth looking into
Oct 24 2021,positive,film of the year best picture of the year
Oct 24 2021,positive,beautifully shot film and well acted great special effects but this is not the usual action film i do  wish a few slow scenes were replaced with an opportunity to understand some characters and fix plot holes a bit of a downer that we dont know if or when there will be a final chapter movie overall a solid recommend could be a great film if they stick the landing with part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,it was slow paced for a movie series that is going to have multiple parts its definitely a great setup and i look forward to the next one
Oct 24 2021,negative,i left the auditorium wanting my money back
Oct 24 2021,positive,one of the best movies ive seen in a really long time
Oct 24 2021,positive,finally a worthy rendering of frank herberts novel
Oct 24 2021,positive,loved it not super excited about there being a part 2 but im happy they didnt try to fit it all into one movie
Oct 24 2021,negative,it was long and boring
Oct 24 2021,positive,good to see another effort with the story of dune the movie is well made but unlike others that marveled over the imagery i didnt think it was jaw dropping i look forward to the sequel
Oct 24 2021,positive,it is a visual pleasure and an incredible journey through denis villeneuves creation also with hans zimmers score involving you throughout the dessert of arrakis an exceptional cast well directed filling and giving everything for this film that will immerse you to  this universe
Oct 24 2021,positive,i fist read dune when it was first released by the small publishing house and loved it ever since this telling of the tale is true to the atmosphere and story of the book see it in imax if you can
Oct 24 2021,positive,the most faithful adaptation of novel to film i have ever seen excellent beautiful a marvel fascinating thought provoking pointed the story is a lesson in the neverchanging story of betrayal greed and jealousy in the governments of mankind the entire film is crafted with dreamy strokes of visual bliss and effective enthralling applications of its themes it never deviates or falters it requires its viewers who live in a world of speed to think quickly and appreciate slowly there is nothing wrong with it
Oct 24 2021,positive,incredible depiction of an epic timeless story loved it ready for all of the forthcoming parts a must see in the theater
Oct 24 2021,negative,amazingly boring movie so long yet so little to see almost nothing in the movie makes sense almost like you need to read the books before you see this to actually make sense of any of it
Oct 24 2021,positive,this movie is close to a masterpiece little issues with the script but the movie the scenes the acting is just spectacular a beauty loved it
Oct 24 2021,positive,loved it did the story justice
Oct 24 2021,positive,amazing treatment the copters the worms the gom jabbar battle hand signs the voice crysknife stilltent
Oct 24 2021,positive,extremely well done its always been a great story this movie really took its time to develop the characters the soundtrack is amazing too it really added to the movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,i never thought i would love a remake more than the original but dune 2021 is a visually stunning masterpiece i sincerely hope the studio green lights the next parts of the story the acting is impeccable and the visuals are breathtaking so far we have watched it 6 times
Oct 24 2021,positive,such a great movie so glad i didnt watch it at home on hbo cannot wait for part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,absolutely stunning
Oct 24 2021,positive,amazing storytelling and visual experience gripping till the end
Oct 24 2021,positive,dope movie soundtrack set up for future movies
Oct 24 2021,positive,truer to the book beautifully shot seemed a bit slow in places
Oct 24 2021,positive,its a great movie but only a good adaptation a lot of early though minor plot points were removed but viewers will still understand whats going on acting and visuals were great and i loved the design for most things in the movie go see it and read the book too
Oct 24 2021,positive,totally awesome super cool remake they did a great job
Oct 24 2021,positive,dude i cannot it literally felt like reading the best beginning to a large book series great acting great special effects great cast overall you really should see it scary at times definitely violent but its just part one of dune
Oct 24 2021,positive,i absolutely loved the movie the digital art design was amazing and the choice of sound effects kept giving me chills highly recommend seeing this movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,i absolutely loved the film top notch acting and physical stunts an incredible ensemble cast and if i could give timothe chalamet an oscar for his performance as paul atreides in this scifi film i would looking forward to dune part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,dune did what dune could not this second film adaptation of dune is something to behold a well directed masterpiece it struggled at times to grasp the scope of the original books source material but cemented itself to launch its own metaverse akin to star wars perhaps being this generations science fiction epic     while i thought going in that the movie was to long it ironically works to be a 25 hour epic rather than moving along as blazing fast speeds it instead takes its time building to a climax before settling to set itself up for a part 2     then there is the music its simply a treat from hans zimmer at times it feels like a spiritual successor to the 1988 akira soundtrack using a similar tone of what will music be in 20000 years
Oct 24 2021,positive,plot was a little much but the cinematography was great
Oct 24 2021,positive,to be completely honest my excitement for dune was primarily due to the involvement of director denis villeneuve i have no ties to the novel or any previous screen adaptations i will say that this can be a challenging movie if youre a newcomer like myself as this movie throws many terms and characters at you in this movie i still thought the movie was fairly accessible and the main storyline is easy enough to follow the movie is slowpaced for a good portion but it is constantly visually stunning the combination of audio and visual elements keeps it engaging the movie is a bit frustrating because it is essentially an exposition movie with some interesting world building but also some lagging moments i am really curious how this film will age because it comes down to how hardhitting a second part would be the characters are portrayed well and the cast is impressive but its those boring yet seemingly important moments that keep the movie from reaching true greatness i still think it is a very solid science fiction movie and the way i would describe the style from the directors previous works in the genre is that it is closer to blade runner 2049 than arrival the latter i would say is one of my favorite films of the last few years overall it is a movie i will definitely have to revisit to get all the details before the next part comes around but not one i am particularly in a rush to rewatch because of how long and slowpaced it is
Oct 24 2021,positive,a masterpiece of a film cant wait for the next one
Oct 24 2021,negative,confusing long and drawn out could have cut out the first hour of the movie then as it got a little bit better it ended abruptly ill never get that 3 hours back
Oct 24 2021,positive,good drama set the scene for a sequal
Oct 24 2021,negative,incredibly slow  boring  only thing good about the movie was the cinematography  story would probably fit a tv series or something not really movie material
Oct 24 2021,positive,loved the original and thought this was a good remake cant wait for the next one
Oct 24 2021,negative,visual effects and background score were good this isnt a selfcontained story and felt that characters were underutilized felt like this isnt a movie for the general audience dense story and the screenplay was drier than the sahara desert for sure not a good adoption into a movie
Oct 24 2021,negative,maybe if some lady wasnt screaming over the entire soundtrack 
Oct 24 2021,positive,the violence is a little toned down due to the pg13 rating but aside from that it is a very accurate and well made film there is a lot of attention to detail and terrific acting i cant wait for the next installment 
Oct 24 2021,positive,amazing one of the best sci fi films in the last 30 years pitch perfect
Oct 24 2021,negative,excruciatingly dull the best part was when it ended like taking your hand out of a pain box
Oct 24 2021,positive,honestlyquite boring    however this movie is clearly just the set up theres still lots to tell apparently if the books are any indication i just felt the movie was quite boring
Oct 24 2021,positive,captivating and excellent job of hitting the key concepts from the fairly complex book in a way an unfamiliar audience can follow and enjoy
Oct 24 2021,positive,if youre not into scifi and fantasy highly dont recommend but if you are youll enjoy the cinematics and plot
Oct 24 2021,positive,even though it was missing some things i enjoyed from the other movies and books by far one of the best adaptation movies i have seen in the last decade
Oct 24 2021,positive,id like to give this 3 stars but id say it deserves better than a simple meh i watched this with non fans so i was hoping it wouldnt be too hard for them to follow they did enjoy the movie but they still didnt really understand most of what was happening very understandable  its dune thats why i never believed the reviews that were calling this the next lord of the rings or star wars as a story its just not accessible in that way    to me the film was technically very well done but a little soulless if anyone remembers that sci fi channel dune miniseries from 20 something years ago the effects were way worse but i actually felt that cast had more chemistry than this one but i do like how they utilized duncan idaho much more here i would have liked more lore and less battles overall a good movie but i dont think it will be too long before fans want another remake
Oct 24 2021,positive,loved every second of it great movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,one of the best movies i have seen in a long long time i hope they have a sequel i was on the edge of my seat a must see movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,decent movie can tell its based on novels
Oct 24 2021,positive,a stunner for the eyes and ears faithful to the source material
Oct 24 2021,positive,the soundtrack was amazing you have to watch it in theaters to really feel the impact denis villeneuve knows how to make a proper slow burn film that keeps your interest in every aspect the cinematography was beautiful as well a must watch
Oct 24 2021,positive,good directing cinematography special effects sound wardrobe acting and obviously story will definitely watch again especially back at graumens
Oct 24 2021,positive,a wellchosen condensed installment of the book  hits every major plot point from the book without dragging it out or brutally misconfiguring it  the score is a bit over the top bit its as faithful a movie as one could hope for from lovers of the literature
Oct 24 2021,positive,i little confusing in the beginning as to who was who a little slow and drawn out story didnt really start until the middle
Oct 24 2021,positive,the first hour was slow but the second half picked up   and action packed
Oct 24 2021,positive,i would have happily sat through another hour or two it was epic ill totally see it again
Oct 24 2021,negative,slow boring too dark to view lighting
Oct 24 2021,positive,dune is the first act of a complete story it gives us a tiny taste of a larger universe that theyre setting up this movie cant be judged properly until theres a sequel that wraps up the story but what they gave me satisfied me
Oct 24 2021,positive,finally    so is warner bros going to screw this up even more by not having episode 2 recorded simultaneously      get on your game  this movie is a freaking mazing thats all
Oct 24 2021,neutral,literally water on us out of nowhere how about a warning
Oct 24 2021,positive,the movie was well done
Oct 24 2021,positive,there is no better timeline than the one where jodorowskys dune was made but we are not in that one we are in this one and this one belongs to villeneuve
Oct 24 2021,positive,my only complaint is that it ended
Oct 24 2021,positive,it was everything i was hoping for different enough not to be just a remake of the previous one and faithful enough to the original material for lifelong fans like myself to enjoy must be experienced on the big screen and big sound the musical score is amazing
Oct 24 2021,positive,great cinematography and cast
Oct 24 2021,positive,absolutely stellar gonna be devastated if this project cannot see its conclusion really really strong adaptation 
Oct 24 2021,negative,director writer and producer 1 of 19 denis villeneuve is very much in love with his sets his special effects and his boxofficedraw cast you can tell because the viewers time is wasted again and again either watching zendayas feet walk in sandals in the sand or being forced to watch timothée chalamet brood and brood yet some more seemingly throughout this entire picture say what you will about the grotesque approach that david lynch took to telling the story in the 1984 film but it made you want to pick up the novel and read it from cover to cover even with all the modern day editing special effects cinematography and set design at villeneuves disposal here in the twenty first century he falls short of presenting a more compelling story than lynch managed to do decades prior comparing this film to star wars is ludicrous heres why george lucas managed to take a cast of virtual unknowns and through special effects a killer soundtrack and legendary editors tell an original story that were still talking about to this day as one of again get this nineteen producers villeneuve is focused more on scenery than story the pacing is slow the soundtrack is loud and obnoxious and the actors cant convey anything convincingly chalamets fight scenes especially arent believable as an actor hes too willowy and wispy and has to wear loose clothing to hide his bony frame even as a training fight you cant tell me josh brolins character wouldnt have wiped the floor with him let alone a seasoned fremen outside his own sietch on arrakis even alec newman was more convincing in the 2000 miniseries with a budget of 165 million warner bros took an awfully big risk trying to make a blockbuster film that now unfortunately requires a sequel sadly they chose celebrity over talent and lets hope they eventually learn from their mistakes
Oct 24 2021,positive,cinematic epic in every sense
Oct 24 2021,positive,i loved the movie i was able to understand the plot and i thought id struggle id recommend people seeing it in the theater if they are able to
Oct 24 2021,positive,amazing cinematography visual effects sound and score super fun little lengthy though and i had to research things after the movie in order to understand i didnt read the books before watching so i knew nothing going in
Oct 24 2021,positive,an absolute motion picture masterpiece
Oct 24 2021,positive,such a tease cant wait for the next one to be fair ive watched every version of dune    sound mixing is the only reason for a nonperfect score whoever decided dialog should be at 2030 volume should get their head examined
Oct 24 2021,positive,great adaptation i have been a long time fan of the series and i hope that the next one is as good as this one is
Oct 24 2021,positive,absolutely stunning the cinematography was great and the costumes are oscar worthy i was blown away when i watched dune for the first time in imax
Oct 24 2021,neutral,it was very confusing
Oct 24 2021,positive,i loved denis villanueves vision of dune i was fully emerald in each character and left me yearning for more cant wait for part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,the most gorgeous scifi movie i have ever seen or heard
Oct 24 2021,neutral,underwhelming for someone who has read the book and incomprehensible for some one who hasnt
Oct 24 2021,positive,in some aspects very different from the 1984 presentation love all the cgi in this movie   all of earths old ways and the feeling of duty and honor shows well cant wait till part two
Oct 24 2021,positive,a very powerful movie with so many thought provoking lines
Oct 24 2021,positive,holds about as close to the classic book as you can get felt as though some scenes were exactly as how i had envisioned it while reading

Oct 24 2021,positive,wow  what a great movie  a definite must see
Oct 24 2021,positive,ive read all the books my husband has not we both were so glad we saw this especially in a theater i was grateful they didnt cram the entire first book into this you were able to take in the scenery u see stories appreciate the effects the music made it part 2 will be the test if there are more dimensions to timothy c
Oct 24 2021,positive,theres a lot to unpack here to some it up its a big sweeping sci fi epic with fine performances sure handed direction and an excellent score theres moments that do drag for me namely in the third act but on rewatch these will most likely not be bothersome honestly this combines a lot of the fun sci fi of star wars and the sprawling deliberately paced beauty of the lord of the rings trilogy definitely looking forward to the second installment
Oct 24 2021,positive,amazing a treat for the eyes
Oct 24 2021,positive,incredible i cant wait for this invigorating gut wrenching series to continue
Oct 24 2021,positive,top notch sound design and cinematography by dennis villeneuve  it was almost perfectly cast with so many compelling actors and a wideranging ensemble if you adored blade runner 2049 then you will love this movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,i wasnt expecting the film to be 2 parts didnt know that until it started and the screen read part 1  other than that close to the original
Oct 24 2021,positive,this was absolutely phenomenal the relationship between the film and the novel is uncanny the soundtrack itself is a 1010 cannot wait for the following films
Oct 24 2021,positive,this movie was phenomenal finally have the technology to tell this story with its proper ambition
Oct 24 2021,positive,loved it all  some of dialogue couldnt be heard  almost a whisper  worth the wait
Oct 24 2021,positive,d u n e  p a r t o n e is everything you want from the beginning of a thrilling story as old as time
Oct 24 2021,positive,i loved the movie and am looking forward to the next one i think i enjoyed it more than star wars loved the characters and the movie stars that played them it followed the book very clodely
Oct 24 2021,positive,epic they got this production right
Oct 24 2021,positive,if youre a fan of the book story and go to see this knowing what the story line is its great i think if you know nothing about the storyyou may find it long with no resolution better than the 80s version for sure waiting for the sequel
Oct 24 2021,negative,boring dont watch in theatre
Oct 24 2021,positive,at the risk of sounding pretentious this is cinema  so many movies are formulaic and kinetic this   is world building at its finest it is slower paced  than most sci fi but for the discerning movie fan  this is art not only in the unparalleled visuals but the  character arcs are something to behold  not to be missed
Oct 24 2021,positive,beautiful photography great sound  this was a great interpretation of the dune book
Oct 24 2021,positive,the more was a great adaptation
Oct 24 2021,negative,i have never seen a more masterful movie as far as visuals sound and acting that i just couldnt care less about the original was a long film and odd and when you find out that the only difference with this one is that it has been broken up into two films making it twice as long you walk out just being pissed off that you didnt even get to see the recreation of the sting fight i wish hollywood would stop milking films and just make one marvelous film the hobbit should never have been a trilogy and this should not have been two films
Oct 24 2021,positive,detail cinematography  attention to detail following the original movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,just kinda slow never picked up and long asf
Oct 24 2021,positive,fantastic adaptation of this classic novel with great cast special effects costume and sound track  thoroughly enjoyed this movie and wished it would keep going  cant wait for part two
Oct 24 2021,positive,one if not the best rendering of a movie from the book i felt like the book and come alive i cant wait to see the second half
Oct 24 2021,positive,as usual for this filmmaking team the visuals and audio design of the film are incredible i was able to follow along with the film well enough without reading the books but it felt a bit hollow the film doesnt have time to flesh out the world outside of the necessary plot information so emotional beats dont hit that being said the actors are definitely giving it their all overall worth the price of admission and ill definitely check out part 2 if they make it
Oct 24 2021,positive,fantastic adaptation to film for those that know the book well there are some changes that are likely mostly for time but it works really well the acting is top notch the script is well written the visuals are stunning and the overall execution is phenomenal the score was great as well but my one gripe would be that there are a few moments in which the dialogue is hidden beneath the score like a christopher nolan film will often do ive been waiting for an artful and faithful adaptation of this book since ifirst read its and its finally here
Oct 24 2021,positive,excellent this movie did not hold back on its source material scenery costume design or pacing
Oct 24 2021,positive,as a huge fan of the original novels dune is as good of an adaptation a reader could hope for dennis villeneuve is a visionary in his prime and nothing displays his talents and dedication than dunes caravaggiolike shot compostion the choice of hans zimmer to score and excellent writing
Oct 24 2021,positive,perfect adaptation of the book
Oct 24 2021,positive,disjointed and drug out
Oct 24 2021,positive,great movie overall cant wait to see the next one
Oct 24 2021,positive,just mad i cant watch the 2nd one right now come on wb more dune
Oct 24 2021,positive,it wasnt as powerful as the 1984 version even seemed slow multiple times still worth seeing  waiting for the 2nd movie  seeing it in theater
Oct 24 2021,positive,the movie is awesome overall the start of the show is good and keeps a good momentum but at the middle and end it slows down tremendously
Oct 24 2021,positive,every scene was a piece of art    wonderfully envisioned and executed   just an amazing movie  the only thing left out was the folding of space with the beast and its minions   perhaps that will show up in subsequent parts
Oct 24 2021,positive,fantastic adaptation of book to movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,the original dune was released in 1984 based on frank herberts sciencefiction novel   the reception was very mixed but lots of praise when to david lynchs surreal direction   now 37 years later denis villeneuve remakes it with updated graphics a topnotch cast and some neat concepts   apparently though this is only the first chapter to set things up so theres a lot to take away   the players include timothy challamete zendaya stellan skarsgard dave bautista josh brolin oscar isaac jason mamoa javier bardem and rebecca ferguson  challamete plays a young boy paul and is having dreams of a girl chani warning him about the end of the planet arrakis a desert planet that heats up to dangerous temperatures and is home to giant sand worms  this worlds sandstorms are so brutal they can tear through metal   a war between his house of harkennen and the freman natives wages for the most valuable source of energy called spice  but the emperor baron doesnt want peace or harvesting he and his people just want to take everything they can   this spice can extend human life and be essential for interstellar travel   and the natives on arrakis due to long exposure from the spice are born with blue eyes   paul finds out from his mother that he is a mixture of bloodlines and dreams he could be the new leader of freedom for arrakis   basically a lot of this is all setup but they do get by establishing world building and amazing visuals   the scope of this is incredible giant sets outstanding visual eye candy and some topcaliber actors   art direction and cinematography is brilliant too   a slowbuilder of a story and the themes are only partially blocked from having it transcend from the source material being universal and modern   when they try to bring in the politics from the books it starts to feel dry   the characters are weak and not fun plus some weak villains but you have very good performances to balance things out   the basic plot it follows is people fighting  over power the source material is very dense but digestible for adults  not since lord of the rings has a book adaptation been this detailed with its own culture technology language and history   its one of those literary works of fiction that adds to its own mythos while also building on itself   colonialism fighting for power and acquiring resources are many big components of this story   denis villeneuve gives viewers an otherworldly feel for a book that wasnt originally meant for the screen   so hopefully part 2 can flesh out some more stuff of epic proportions   the hardcore fans will go nuts for this improving on the david lynch version
Oct 24 2021,positive,as a fan of the original i liked the movie i was only going to give it 4 stars because i had no idea it was only part 1 but come on thats really a plus more awesomeness to come there were things in this movie that wasnt in the original and i liked that i have never read the books so i cant speak to how that story was depicted here i loved the pace  the visuals and the music you knew you were watching something epic which is how i hoped it would be treated if you liked the original i think youll savor this remake
Oct 24 2021,positive,really rad movie great world building and acting from everyone its bigbrain star wars
Oct 24 2021,positive,im going into this fictional world with little knowledge of its prolific source material and havent seen david lynchs troubled adaptation in full my expectations are solely as a casual viewer and avid moviegoer so i do not have a grasp on what was precisely translated from author frank herberts visionary work there is no denying that denis villeneuves dune part one is a truly incredible cinematic experience a singular cinematic treat that comes around after several years and yet it is like nothing you have ever seen before there is some much to say about the technical brilliance on display here this film alone is a visual masterpiece with some of the most aweinspiring sequences to ever brought to the silverscreen the cinematography is phenomenal the sound design is eerily absorbing the production design are otherworldly hans zimmers score is amazingly evocative and the visual effects are so seamless that i was convinced that every single frame was real with every production department being topnotch this is the closest film we have had that is visually on par with the timeless epicness or gritty intimacy of the lord of the rings you could arguably call it the sciencefiction equivalent of the former since it was also considered to be unfilmable at one point an ambitious work of audiovisual art      aside from its staggeringly immersive achievements that need to be experienced on the biggest and best screens available the overall narrative and characters are laidout very well the worldbuilding feels uniquely compelling but the characters help to keep it engaging with a film of this immense scale the drama feels more personal which makes the spectacle more enthralling there is a good balance struck with the exposition there is a bit more urgency to the plot than expected one thing to know is that villeneuves adaptation is one of a consistent tone somber  serious i cant say this is an emotionally affecting film with heart or levity so it will come off a bit cold or even dull to some viewers but what it lacks in an tangible emotional core it makes up for in its excellent cast of performances everyone does a stellar job with their respective roles and there is some very good characterization that makes me care for the characters and their relationships while the film is expertly unravels its majestic settings i cant recommend this film enough but alas this is not the full breath of villeneuves passionate vision of dune it is an expansive story that was specifically plotted and structured with two films in mind i plead to all the fans of dune and moviegoers to see this film in the theater asap with part one being so darn impressive this could easily become a twopart masterpiece  910 a
Oct 24 2021,positive,awesome effects and great acting
Oct 24 2021,positive,its not the end so i cant give four or five stars
Oct 24 2021,positive,great part one but we need the part two
Oct 24 2021,positive,if you are familiar with dune and the dune universe you will find this movie wanting great visual and special effects do not make a movie   this movie is half the book and of that half it is missing or has rewritten a large amount do not expect guild navigator the imperial court the mention of choam company contracts smugglers military strategy baron harkonnons preferences feyd rautha or even heartplugs one the plus side they do show muad dib
Oct 24 2021,positive,i am thankful it was split into two movies there would have been zero chance for adaptation this good any other way i can not wait for the next one
Oct 24 2021,negative,very difficult to follow along with only used zendaya for clout tbh
Oct 24 2021,positive,ive seen better and worse dune movies will be watching part 2 though d
Oct 24 2021,positive,it was epic loved every minute cant wait for the next installment of dune
Oct 24 2021,positive,the most impressive movie ive ever seen in a theater like watching star wars a new hope for the first time or the fellowship of the ring
Oct 24 2021,positive,really great so few missteps director cast soundtrack everything super made my top 20 favorite scifi movie list even without a second half could really climb high if the second part is as good as this saw it 3 times already
Oct 24 2021,positive,did a very good job following the book and handled the world building much better than lynch did
Oct 24 2021,positive,great visuals good acting and lots of easter eggs for fans like me who have read the books but even for fans it was too long could have been edited down to 2 hours
Oct 24 2021,positive,i felt like i was playing catchup a little trying to get the familieshouses and politics straight those whove read the book wont have that problem i found the story pulled me in and the characters were great
Oct 24 2021,positive,if perfection was a movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,acting set design score everything was immersive never before have i stopped and realized a movie was quite long and hoping it would be even longer
Oct 24 2021,negative,zendaya was barely in the movie action scenes were trash they couldve had better fighting scenes for jason
Oct 24 2021,positive, very good but it was really long
Oct 24 2021,positive,i liked how true to the book this movie was and the performances were all outstanding the only thing i disliked was during several scenes the soundtrack was overly loud which drowned out the dialogue i have read the books and seen the previous productions so i knew most of the dialogue already i expect anyone for whom the story is unfamiliar this would result in them understanding less of the story thus enjoying it less
Oct 24 2021,negative,i was so lost the entire movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,it was phenomenally epic from start to finish loved every minute of it 1010 
Oct 24 2021,positive,loved it incredible film work and world building
Oct 24 2021,positive,some of the dialogue was difficult to understand we were disappointed by the convention or lack thereof
Oct 24 2021,positive,faithful to the book
Oct 24 2021,positive,movie was fantastic all the way around theatre extremely comfortable and clean and concessions staff very friendly and efficient
Oct 24 2021,positive,beautifully shot amazing casting and stays pretty close to the source material my kid said omg its like star wars and the matrix
Oct 24 2021,positive,fan of the original loved this interpretation cant wait to see part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,fantastic the most true to the source material of any adaptation yet
Oct 24 2021,positive,im a dune fan read the books seen the prior version dozens of times  and this movie blew me away  expertly done  all scifi fans must see  absolutely great 25 hours hollywood needs to finish the sequel asap
Oct 24 2021,positive,phenomenal movie the film stayed pretty true to the book and the cinematography and cast were spectacular cant wait for the 2nd part
Oct 24 2021,positive,the only disappointment is that it is part one the film stays true to the book and it is a wonderful interpretation if you are a dune fan watch it but save this for the theatre not hbomax it deserves a large screen
Oct 24 2021,negative,an overwrought and boring art film masquerading as a science fiction opus dune is simply awful and way too long the musical score is an unremitting headache of loud wailing voices that ruin the cinematography   how bad was this movie even a onesecond cameo appearance by jar jar binks would have increased the likeability of dune by 1000
Oct 24 2021,positive,arresting from the first moment until the last perhaps the best film i have ever seen
Oct 24 2021,positive,a visual masterpiece it had the ambition of an 1980s scifi film but executed to perfection it will prove to be a timeless addition to the pantheon of scifi classics incredible music and cinematography cant wait for the next one
Oct 24 2021,positive,wow actionpacked great story
Oct 24 2021,positive,excellent movie the producers did an excellent job of introducing characters and developing them throughout the movie they gave me enough to be intrigued and look forward to the sequel
Oct 24 2021,positive,seemed britishmade slow to start building the storyplot but good buildup and character development nice sword fights was hoping for more sand worms tho maybe next time
Oct 24 2021,positive,a stunningly beautiful movie that unfortunately chose to focus on action instead of character in a world full of weirdness and strangeness from frank herbert we are left with battle scenes and explosions epic and stunning  but ultimately a shallow pool of the depths that could have been explored
Oct 24 2021,positive,beautifully done and closer to the book
Oct 24 2021,positive,great movie cant wait for part two 
Oct 24 2021,positive,one of the best book to movie adaptations ive seen the books are one of my favorite series the movie cast and screenplay is excellent herbert would be proud
Oct 24 2021,positive,true to the book and beautifully shot
Oct 24 2021,neutral,slow and not that interesting
Oct 24 2021,negative,boring slow moving no real plot line same old song and dance  im surprised they made such a big deal of zendaya being in it she must have been onscreen all of 5 minutes and had a single page of dialog if that
Oct 24 2021,positive,loved the book and i was so excited to see this villeneuve did not disappoint there were some elements from the book that were missing and at points it was hard to hear dialogue over the loud but amazing score great acting by chalamet and ferguson cant wait for part 2
Oct 24 2021,neutral,1 how many times does the audience need to be told paul dreamed of chani  made pauls character weak and undeveloped  very disappointing  2 duncans character was undeveloped and the audience was not connected to duncans death opportunity for depth lost  and you have no excuse for that because of the wonderful book  3 rebecca ferguson overacted almost expected her to break into excruciating spasms every minute  roll eyes  4 oscar isaac was great but please are there any other actors in hollywood besides this guy  im sick of seeing him in everything  5 the visual affects the costumes were absolutely stunning and really the best part of the movie  6 i was disappointed to read part 2 would be all about chani and i wont be watching in that case  i have too much respect to see you chop it up for political correctness  overall this was horribly disappointing and you cannot get oscars for stunning visuals
Oct 24 2021,positive,amazing visually stunning and true to the book drawing you in at every turn and pulling you closer with every twist
Oct 24 2021,positive,i saw the first one because my husband was a dune fan i hated it probably because i had no clue what was going on for this one i read the synopsis and heard a review which said george lucas was influenced by dune when making star wars my husbands was my personal cliff notes and i loved this one the actors and the cinematography were exceptional the one criticism i have is that sometimes the music drowned out the voices sadly this often happens with todays films and tv shows i highly recommend this film
Oct 24 2021,neutral,its dune  not star wars  what did you expect characters are there but disconnected from the audience dont really care about any of them boring  emotionless at least david lynchs version made his characters a bit more likable for the audience and understood that much
Oct 24 2021,positive,at 2h36m long my only criticism is that the film was too short visually stunning perfectly shot great sound designmusic badass fight scenes everything is used perfectly to cultivate a thick atmosphere of mystery and tension does it suck that it ends on a to be continued yes but its still a mustsee in my book    go watch it now so we can get the ball rolling on that sequel
Oct 24 2021,positive,true to the book in many ways  but also had some changes that i liked especially with duncan idaho but many things a fremen would never do
Oct 24 2021,positive,i have been a fan of dune for many years  having read the series several times and enjoy all of the nuances of the books  while visually stunning i felt the story to be a bit watered down and several characters that were extremely strong in the book were weak in this film
Oct 24 2021,positive,best adaptation of dune ive ever seen
Oct 24 2021,positive,wonderful and awesome
Oct 24 2021,positive,have not read the book but this was fantastic
Oct 24 2021,positive,i had heard of dune it had been recommended to me to read and either by being busy or realizing it wasnt the kind of scifi i was into i had put off reading it well that changed last week i saw the previews for the movie and set out to complete all 700 off pages before this came out im glad i did this movie is remarkable the effects the score the story telling the casting all of it was fantastic its incomplete in the sense that i wished for a better cut off in the movie as far as where the movie ended rise of the maudib but the story telling and the closeness it followed the book i would recommend this movie to anyone
Oct 24 2021,positive,absolutely amazing visually and musically aligned very strongly with the book
Oct 24 2021,positive,the movie was pretty good the plot moved very quick compared to the narrative so it was hard to follow at times but overall it was a good experience
Oct 24 2021,positive,super slow i feel like its building so it has promise but the first 145 was dragging
Oct 24 2021,positive,beginning felt a little rushed but sort of slowed down and began to allow you to process tons of action between the fight scenes worm chases and overall drama of the visions cant wait to see the next one
Oct 24 2021,positive,its very long slow moving at times but i guess its setting up for the sequels good acting and action scenes
Oct 24 2021,negative,good looking very long bad movie not worth your time or mine
Oct 24 2021,positive,movie exceeded expectations cool special effects and offered a world much like i envisioned from the book
Oct 24 2021,positive,incredible  epic storytelling grand cinematography and talented acting
Oct 24 2021,positive,with most sciif films now i feel something that is greatly missing is ambition and above all vision such film franchises like star wars have failed because the personality and vision arent there there is no plan and also because people have grown sick of it and cause it just feels like spam other scifi i have seen are lacking a lot in scope and scale and some films i see feel like they take the cheap route so they can make a sequel that winds up getting canceled cause no one wants to see it and cause the movie fails cough artemis foul chaos walking etc but with this film denis villenueve blew me away by bringing everything that was missing from these films a filmmaker that gives a sht about everything he is making and has an incredible vision for dune and unlike most movies that have failed sequels i feel dune is actually going to succeed and unlike other franchises that have become stale and died down this feels so incredibly refreshing and feels like it is reviving the scifi genre also worth mentioning since this is a remake unlike 99 of remakes that come out only for money and exist only for the sake of existing and grabbing cash here and there this is probably the best remake ive seen in a long time a remake that builds in every single way that the original by david lynch and doing something completely new and refreshing from turning a movie from the 80s thats basically a piece of trash to a masterpiece the scope and scale of the movie is pretty phenomenal from the world story and characters it has established it feels so unique and like it was made by a master without a doubt one of the most ambitious movies ever made and you can tell every single person involved in this project is bringing their a game on it i feel that making a video on this movie would definitely be the way to go when discussing this movie genuinely excited to see the next dune and where they take it next i feel almost certain itll be as good and successful this is even the kind of movie that i want to see more of and have everyone take from as to why it worked hypothetically if this is a sign for things to come and this might sound hyperbolic we could probably enter a literal golden age everyone should go out of their way to see this incredible film and for those morons review bombing this movie for what denis said about marvel go fck yourself like literally calm down
Oct 24 2021,positive,denis put the book in film format perfectly it is a treat  for fans of frank herberts dune especially its perfectly created acting is superb timothée brings pauls inner turmoil to life so well its incredible this is a no questions asked you have to see this in imax movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,really good not super predictable and great cast and effects
Oct 24 2021,positive,timothée chalamet turns in a wooden choosen one performance in a movie that feels like a streaming series and would have been better as a video game
Oct 24 2021,positive,yes i compared it to the 1984 version it didnt disappoint im looking forward to the second movie id love to see a more grotesque baron in the next movie and im hoping the star of the movie looks a little more mature in the sequel it was still a great movie 
Oct 24 2021,positive,its dune and it isnt the bizzaro lynch version
Oct 24 2021,positive,the cinematography and the actors i cant wait until part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,very true to the book
Oct 24 2021,positive,visual feast that is very faithful to the books cant wait to see the sequels music is out of this world
Oct 24 2021,positive,great story  finally told with actors and technology worthy of the tale
Oct 24 2021,positive,epic filmaking on full display  i think i loved it
Oct 24 2021,positive,cinematography was outstanding  casting was great and enjoyed the special effects  cant wait for the next chapter
Oct 24 2021,positive,great movie from start to finish
Oct 24 2021,positive,amazing  must see even if youre not familiar with the book
Oct 24 2021,positive,enjoyed the movie but why is everything shot so dark hard to see at times and the fight scenes hard to follow still looking forward to second one 
Oct 24 2021,positive,im an old fan  wasnt disappointed  have to wait for part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,good story interesting plot no ending
Oct 24 2021,negative,the movie was too long and boring i preferred the david lynchs dune which was mystical and magical
Oct 24 2021,positive,i read dune when i was a teenager and then many of the sequels this movie finally did justice to one of my favorite novels
Oct 24 2021,positive,incredible one of the best scifi epics ive ever seen so much style and beauty please go see in the theater for your own sake and to ensure part 2 is made
Oct 24 2021,positive,i loved how well denis stuck to the books story and feel i cannot express how happy this movie made me as a fan of the book i want to be critical but i honestly cannot find anything i disagree with the baron still floats around which isnt how it works in the book but i understand the decision from a visual perspective i really cannot wait to see part two own this on blu ray and watch it on hbo max again as soon as i get home
Oct 24 2021,positive,you must see this movie you absolutely have to
Oct 24 2021,positive,since i had read the book and seen the first dune movie i had a good grasp of the plot but my wife and daughterinlaw were lost  there should have been better plot development knowing how complex the overall plot is
Oct 24 2021,positive,fantastic movie masterfully directed you can definitely tell that denis villeneuve is a fan and respects the source material this movie offers a sense of scale that i havent experienced in a while this movie made me excited for whats to come it is an absolute must see
Oct 24 2021,positive,it was a pretty movie a lot of background a little anticlimactic ill probably watch the second one though to see where the story goes looks like theyll take it beyond the original
Oct 24 2021,neutral,im honestly believe this movie is overrated
Oct 24 2021,positive,truly a visual masterpiece that needs to be seen on the biggest screen you can find do yourself a favor and see it in a theater
Oct 24 2021,positive,very good butt long
Oct 24 2021,positive,the visuals and audio were both stunning and the story was extremely interesting and pulled me in the only bad part about this movie is that well need to wait a few years for part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,one of the most beautiful engaging movies ive seen in a very long while  the high quality production is very evident from the first frame  it also stays true to the book  i cant wait to see part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,awesome direction acting  cinematography immersive world building very worth seeing on the big screen
Oct 24 2021,positive,pros strong cast and acting amazing visual style and music cons weak on plot structure not much of a climax
Oct 24 2021,positive,i enjoyed the 1984 dune when i was a kid though admittedly it didnt hold up well over the years i still havent read the book so enjoying the 1984 movie was easy back then    fast forward to 2021 and i still havent read the book and watched the movie today after watching the movie i now feel compelled to read the book the storytelling and cinematics of this version of dune are incredible    i experience the movie in a regal theater with the rumble seats if you like rumble seats they pair well with dune as a sandworm approached the whole theater felt like it was shaking and added to the experience    i hope you enjoy this version of dune as much as i did i feel like a kid all over again 
Oct 24 2021,positive,the visuals in this movie are epic after reading the book and being mostly disappointed in past adaption this is a very welcome breath of fresh air
Oct 24 2021,positive,certainly better than previous attempts to adapt the story heard a lot of talking in the theater when it ended others seemed to enjoy it as well
Oct 24 2021,positive,great movie to see in imax very true to the book so much better than the original movie from the 80s
Oct 24 2021,negative,terrible we walked out half way through not sure why people compare this to star wars it is not even close dont waste your money
Oct 24 2021,positive,what a solidly excellent movie the story pacing casting all aspects were spoton for a great experience i went into it with no expectations for the story having not read the book so i dont know how it stands up as an adaptation as its own artistic work though it succeeded on every level  so much happens in the story and yet it never feels rushed or unexplained it felt like an epic journey
Oct 24 2021,positive,it realized the promise of the book far better than could have been expected where is part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,cinematography and score was phenomenal
Oct 24 2021,positive,excellent movie read the book and im really happy with the movie cant wait for part 2 acting phenomenal
Oct 24 2021,positive,saw it in imax best theater experience ive had since batman begins i cant stop thinking about it truly immersive
Oct 24 2021,positive,visually stunning well acted 
Oct 24 2021,positive,the special seat effects didnt always match the scene at least it seemed to be that way the movie was great
Oct 24 2021,positive,read all the books watched both the 1984 dune movie and the syfy tv series this is probably the worst attempt at frank herberts magnum opus so far    the movie isnt total trash good actors good set and prop design good costume design and a few small moments and details keep it out of the trash bin    but overall this is another loud dark and obnoxious dv movie with little substance or weight to it ala bladerunner 2049 its another one of those movies made by and for a generation of people that are content to be ignorant and stupid while skimming only the surface nuances of a story    i really had high hopes for this bit of cinematography i kept telling myself that bladerunner 2049 wouldnt be the low brow standard of dvs work but alas it wasnt so its sad to say but the trailers make this out to be a far better movie than what we actually received it also makes me question what exactly dv spent all of the movies budget on  im really starting to think that dv is a sham after this latest crap sack installment of loud and dark edginess
Oct 24 2021,negative,good visual effects only that
Oct 24 2021,negative,so boreing of a movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,beautifully filmed perfect casting and faithful to the source material i appreciated taking the time to set up the context and world cant wait for part two when things will really heat up
Oct 24 2021,positive,it wasnt perfect but it was still the best film ive ever seen
Oct 24 2021,positive,fairly good movie i couldnt tell the difference between spice and the sand though 
Oct 24 2021,negative,i dont know which one is worse the original one or this catastrophe of a reboot
Oct 24 2021,positive,holy shit this movie is a fucking masterpiece the best visuals of a movie ive ever seen the score is brilliantly crafted the storytelling while not filled with action is so amazing to watch the lore of the movie is a sight to behold everything about this movie is amazing and is why this is now my favorite movie ever made please do yourself a favor and watch this on the biggest imax screen near you you will not regret it
Oct 24 2021,negative,honestly i am a huge fan of the story and the old movie i had high expectations so it is probably my fault for expecting too much and why does everything have to be part of a franchise now are the days of stand alone one part movies over
Oct 24 2021,positive,while i have never read the book its based on i have watched all the adaptations of the dune novel    positives      ship designs i loved the ship designs  the main characters do a good job delivering their lines    casting there are some big names here and they do a good job although the jessica character often looked like she was laughing when i think she was meant to be crying    negatives   first and foremost the sound levels  its one of those whispering dialogue to loud action scenes movies      characters while i knew the characters from previous versions this version did very little to set up the individuals or tell us anything about them other than their names  i kept getting the names gurney and duncan mixed up and had to go on wikipedia to remind myself what the difference was in their roles      visuals its an everyone wears black all the time movie the villains are all generic sitsinshadows types hope you dont want to know what character is doing what because its all going to be happening in front of a green screen in the dark    the characters in freman suits still arent wearing the headpiece  youd think we could get at least some kind of clear head covering that would let the actors be seen or pull a tony stark in the avengers movies and cut to their face under the mask      plot and backstory again i know what spice is used for based on other movies but this one just says space travel and blue eyes  i did not hear the spice must flow once    pacing for a 25 hour movie they seem to rush through scenes but dont really establish anything
Oct 24 2021,positive,a little slow but it sets up nicely for part 2
Oct 24 2021,negative,wasnt impressed  the 1984 david lynch version was better  big problem with hollywood is it likes beating a dead horse  should have done the second book  its like the third version of batman returns after the first one you might better stay home and knit some booties
Oct 24 2021,positive,epic loved the 1984 version and was a little afraid of being disappointed by this one that definitely did not happen though very well done cant wait for part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,one of the best fantasy movies out there 
Oct 24 2021,neutral,excellent production values true to the book chalamet lacked charisma uninspired performance
Oct 24 2021,positive,great looking and sounding movie hit almost all of the book plot points and im glad they didnt lift the dialog straight from the books
Oct 24 2021,positive,great movie amazing cinematics excited for part 2 hopefully
Oct 24 2021,positive,overall the movie was really good visuals were amazing characters were great the stakes were high however this movies still has its problems some characters couldve been used a bit more which is unfortunate because the book was great with exploring the relationships between characters and the characters beliefs its not explored as much in the film the movie at times feels a bit oddly paced besides that everything else was great and i  think that its an enjoyable film
Oct 24 2021,positive,that french bastard crushed it
Oct 24 2021,positive,incredibly well done 
Oct 24 2021,positive,dune is a spectacular affair its the first scifi movie that made sense to me as a nonreader of science fiction ive only read the first chapter of the book every moment was intense beautiful ontheedge of your seat emotional denis director should be very proud about what he achieved as well as hans music and the cinematographers    acting  1010  character development 1010  storyline 1010  timothee chalamet 101010101010 man that box of pain science give me childs give this young man an oscar     i need part two like now warne bros ive got my eye on you
Oct 24 2021,positive,the scale the costumes the cast the music the style it checks all the boxes for what this fan of the dune series has wanted for so long in a movie adaptation the movie captures the scope of the planet and the armies so well an absolutely amazing scifi movie
Oct 24 2021,negative,dragged on and on and on and on the cgi was amazing but the movie seemed utterly dependent on the viewer already knowing the story
Oct 24 2021,positive,i feel like i have been waiting for a decade at least to see a science fiction film of this quality this was so phenomenal that i wanted to go right back inside the theater and buy a ticket for a 1000pm showing i was so wrapped up in the story there was an agonizing beauty about it a story so glorious vicious and clear and it was so well cast and filmed that it was such a heartwrench when the credits began to roll as a lover of science fiction i have felt the lack of quality in the filmed genre so acutely i just hope that the next films are as carefully filmed and edited i used to love other standbys of science fiction but poor leadership lack of vision and storylines and poor casting choices ruined those films for me this film brought faith in the genre as a filmed entity back into my life
Oct 24 2021,positive,incredibly well done
Oct 24 2021,positive,loved it  cant wait for part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,an absolute treasure of an adaption from frank herberts legendary novel the director made a real masterpiece of a movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,the only disappointing part is there will be years til we get a part two which has the potential to be more exciting then part 1
Oct 24 2021,positive,not enough action but very well done
Oct 24 2021,positive,that i must wait for the next part
Oct 24 2021,positive,loved the cast the cinematography progression of the story  well done
Oct 24 2021,positive,i watched star wars all over again  too many characters and themes that were just ripoffs
Oct 24 2021,positive,phenomenal amazing fantastic perfect movie adaptation of a literary masterpiece a masterpiece renews your faith in cinema art and sets the standard very high
Oct 24 2021,negative,meh it passed the time
Oct 24 2021,positive,a must see for any dune series fan  true to the series cant wait for the next movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,i am not a big fan of political squabbles on the big screen i go to movies to enjoy the action from the big screen this remake was better than original but still on the slower side i understand that they are trying to stay close to the books at some extent and this is just part one closer to the end it felt as if they already finished but then they didnt and ran for another 20 minutes it was a good experience overall
Oct 24 2021,positive,followed the book nicely  visuals consistent
Oct 24 2021,positive,visuals soundtrack stunning did justice to the book
Oct 24 2021,positive,dune is the start of a staple series absolutely stunning visuals great archetype and original storytelling
Oct 24 2021,positive,every frame is just  gorgeous
Oct 24 2021,positive,well frank herberts dune hasnt yet been fully and faithfully brought to the screen but this one proves watchable and a worthy effort kudos especially for not trying to bite off too much of the story in one film i will wait for the next installment  i wont get picky about details this is generally a finely made filmthe production values the fx is are well done the acting may grown on me a bit if i watch it a few more times  my only true disappointment is it not having a truly grand sountrack and theme that i somehow feel a film of dune needs to haveone that will stick in your head for years and be instantly recognizable there will be inevitable comparisons to the other film and tv versions i wont get into the favorites gameeach has their strong and weak points like the not so faithful foundation series now on apple this dune is still worth a watch even if it isnt matching your vision of the story
Oct 24 2021,positive,amazingworth every penny
Oct 24 2021,positive,was my 3rd time seeing it just totally phenomenal so accurate to the book 
Oct 24 2021,positive,although it is only part 1 of a more than 1 part series this movie literally dragged everything out everything could have gotten to the point in 90 minutes dave bautista had no action scenes jason mamoa dies in the the first movie not that bad of a movie overall but im not sure i will he seeing the sequel
Oct 24 2021,positive,excellent there were scenes straight from the books the acting was perfect and the score beyond i could have imagined
Oct 24 2021,positive,i am a big fan of the books and i really really loved this so amazing to see this on the big screen this is something epic done right
Oct 24 2021,positive,loved it kept to old movies excellence
Oct 24 2021,positive,cool cant wait to see the trilogy completed
Oct 24 2021,positive,omg i was all in from the opening scene  i had always heard and was aware of dune but never understood why it was so beloved until today  finally the movie to do it justice this will most definitely hold up against the test of time  gorgeous cinematography along with that music this is what movie making is all about  i do agree with the consensus about the slower pacing after the coup part of the film but will most definetey show up for part ii to see how it all ends  i cannot rave enough about timothee chalamet  he has literally been my favorite actor since seeing him in little women  he is a rare and extraordinary talent  i feel this is an oscarworthy performance for him but may not be realized until part ii well maybe later given hes still so young but what a bright trajectory he is on  and lastly i am only giving it 45 stars because of where it ended but i understand this may be the necessary pause so that more time can be spent on further development and actual storytelling in part ii which i hope gets made because this has all the potential in the world for being one of the alltime great movie classics  mad kudos to the director for pulling this off  a true testament to how movies can be magic
Oct 24 2021,negative,the movie dragged on and was generally boring i kept hoping it would get better and it never did
Oct 24 2021,positive,if you are looking for cinematic junkfood scifi blockbuster pablum please do not go see dune   instead go see disneys regurgitated marvel mush dune is made for fans of the books  those that have read and appreciated herberts masterpiece and have been waiting for a version like villeneuves one that presents an epic story with intelligence and adheres more closely to the story than previous stylistically overwrought interpretations if you have not read the books loved the book  you are probably not going to get or like this movie casting was great adaptation great music amazing effects and cinematography awesome bring on part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,great visuals great sound great cast a bit more on the guild and harkonans would be good but would have been too much
Oct 24 2021,positive,cinematography is great  number of actors is excellent
Oct 24 2021,positive,truly spectacular like edge of your seat cant wait for the next one kind of movie leaves you craving more
Oct 24 2021,positive,truly epic ive read the book many times and loved how it kept to the heart of the book the 84 version was an absolute mess and incoherent this is a masterpiece and is made to watch on the biggest screen possible there are lots of dream sequences that every detail needs to be absorbed as well as every scene the characters are complex the world building epic it is thought provoking cinema if you dont let it take you youll find it boring immerse yourself into it i took my 15 year old daughter who knew nothing of dune who followed it and was blown away by it visually storytelling wise the score the acting and the politics and back stabbing betrayl the prophecies and the pure scale of everything  especially the sand worms the worm scenes were epic and made you feel you were on the desert of arrakis and the thopters were even better than the book villeneuve made somethings better than the bookamazing   overall  i hope you enjoy what we did bring on part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,definantly long no doubt about that and a slow burner with a sprinkle of action here and there but fantastic world building cinematography and sound
Oct 24 2021,positive,the only flaw i found was the cgi of the desert it was not convincing otherwise it would have gotten 5 starts
Oct 24 2021,positive,wife and i loved it cant wait for part two
Oct 24 2021,positive,they have done a good job of adapting a complicated and wonderful story into a movie that stays true to the book the acting is excellent and dune part one does a good job of setting the stage and providing needed explanations for the second half of the story the cinematography is well done i felt visually transported to another world
Oct 24 2021,positive,the new version of dune is absolutely amazing   done perfectly in every way possible this modern telling of an immensely rich and complex story is brought to life so well you will feel like you are thereit is spectacular 
Oct 24 2021,positive,dune 2021 is a solid hollywood spectacle of a film that should appeal to a mass market extremely beautifully shot like every shot could be a painting or poster hanging from a wall however villeneuve has skirted around adapting the unadaptable story of dune to the big screen by literally stripping it down to its essential story beats with the exception of paul and jessica there is literally no character development in a film with a near 3hour runtime characters just speak and do things with no motivations or backstory to why they feel the way they do characters like leto gurney thufir raban the baron piter and kynes got done dirty and story elements like the combine honnete ober advancer mercantiles choam spacing guild the navigators shaddam iv irulan feyd rautha were left out entirely the entire film is based around the control and export of this commodity called mélange but yet villeneuve never shows the audience what the stuff actually does or is used for or why it is so important to the landsraad     tldr go watch this film for the spectacle but if you do not want to read the books then i suggest you check out the syfy miniseries by far still the best adaptation of the story and characters of dune put to film
Oct 24 2021,positive,it takes frank herberts masterpiece and brings it to life with stunning visuals and a visceral feel the wonder and pain are all too real amaze
Oct 24 2021,positive,this version of dune is beautiful relatively faithful to the book well acted and not a movie its a nearly 3 hour long first half of a movie which is something they neglected to mention before the title card pops up and honestly it dragged as a result in a few places its not bad per se but i was glad i didnt pay extra to see it in theaters id honestly wait a few years to see this first act once they finish the movie in the second half
Oct 24 2021,positive,this was everything it was supposed to be and more i cannot remember the last time i saw a movie adaptation that was so accurate to its source material it needs to be watched the first time on the biggest movie screen you can find  then watch it again and again after that  i hope they make a dozen of these movies to really capture the entire story that was created with dune the series of books is amazing and if part one is any indication of what is to come i could not be more excited bravo
Oct 24 2021,positive,the only had part about this movie is that it ended
Oct 24 2021,neutral,as a big dune fan of the book and previous movie not the miniseries im mixed in my views as much hype as was put into this i dont feel it delivered it felt rushed and had poor character dialog and almost no character development some things were great but i didnt leave feeling i saw the best movie ever which i was hoping it was gonna be i had high hopes and high expectations sorry denny but you did a far better job with blade runner
Oct 24 2021,positive,im ready for part 2 and part 3 if it is a trilogy
Oct 24 2021,positive,great visuals great sound needs to be seen in the theater i felt consumed into that world part 2 needs to happen
Oct 24 2021,positive,outstanding would be 5 stars if it wasnt just a first part 
Oct 24 2021,positive,i rarely write reviews but i have on occasion wondered what it mustve been like to be a part of the original audience when viewing a piece of landmark cinema such as 2001 space odyssey or star wars a new hope it must have felt like watching dune     yes through much of the film you feel lost this is a fair criticism but its only because its telling one small story in a vast universe much like star wars there is an empire filled with imperial families of various power i am so intrigued to learn more about this universe and i understand people who might be frustrated by this film that gives you so little exposition opting instead to let you learn visually how incredible each of these characters are     its visually beautiful it sounds amazing but ultimately the story it tells is very simple i wont spoil anything but pay close attention to the conversation between paul and his father before they leave their home world    for all of dunes complexity its a story about finding ones own path to greatness     i watched this movie on hbo max in my home i may just have to visit the theater because the people who made this movie deserves my 30 and i want them to make as many of these films as they possibly can
Oct 24 2021,negative,the whole thing visually was very dull combine that with a story that has almost no action and you have a good recipe to put someone to sleep
Oct 24 2021,positive,dune was incredible visually but there were too many closeups of timothée chalamets face
Oct 24 2021,positive,that is how you do dune
Oct 24 2021,positive,villeneuve deftly weaves together a rich tapestry of complex worldbuilding political intrigue dogfights sword fights all in 25 hours where on the other hand lucas needed 6 different films my only complaint is that zimmers score is perhaps too reminiscent of his recent work on wonder woman and im left wondering what johan johannson would have done instead guess ill just listen to arrival again   the bottom line is if youre bored maybe its not the films fault
Oct 24 2021,positive,that was excellent looking forward to part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,amazing it does the original justice and captivates with stunning visuals and a superb soundtrack truly a masterpiece
Oct 24 2021,positive,excellent movie i saw the book in the big screen
Oct 24 2021,negative,muddy sound dark visually confusing  story line   ugh  save your 
Oct 24 2021,positive,it has great graphics
Oct 24 2021,positive,best adaptation by far  loved it
Oct 24 2021,positive,cinematographer did a great job pace is quicker than original and for a dessert movie visuals were stunning fun seeing all the disney star wars and marvel actors in this movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,awesomewish i could see the next one now
Oct 24 2021,positive,2 hrs 35 minutes of sand worms dreams
Oct 24 2021,positive,great story a bit slow
Oct 24 2021,positive,takes you to another world wow
Oct 24 2021,neutral,less frank herbert more like star wars and game of thrones had a baby
Oct 24 2021,negative,only thing good about this movie was the cgi love the actors but lost the whole time
Oct 24 2021,positive,villeneuves dune is a stylistically beautiful and narratively wellcrafted adaptation of herberts classic science fiction novel it sticks fairly closely to the structure of the book but does leave some holes and some subtle moments from the book might be lost on viewers not familiar with the source material there are differences from the book to be sure but all of the major notes are there and adapting dune is a significant challenge villeneuve was up to the task the art design of the film is spectacular with some nods to lynchs dune here but the sound design is vastly superior to the earlier attempt very well acted and maintains a good balance between the political conflicts human drama and action this isnt fast food action scifi its slow cooked and rich
Oct 24 2021,positive,honestly i have not read the 1965 novel that this is based on nor the 1984 film by david lynch however i am a huge fan of the director denis villeneuve and loved all the films he has made so far the premise is paul atreides a brilliant and gifted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding must travel to the most dangerous planet in the universe to ensure the future of his family and his people as malevolent forces explode into conflict over the planets exclusive supply of the most precious resource in existence only those who can conquer their own fear will survive so is this another hit by denis or his first work i dont like    lets get the obvious out the way first dune 2021 is a visual spectacle the cinematography by greig fraser is wonderful every shot in dune is gorgeous whilst also capturing the beautiful and grand nature of the otherworld planets the costume and set department also do a wonderful job of really making it seem futuristic especial praise to the design of all the spaceships as they are remarkably designed the cgi is very good as well thankfully hans zimmer of interstellar fame does the music score for this film and it is magnificent he uses to great effect a choir and electrical instruments that elevates every scene in the film dune 2021 also features a stellar cast who all do a great job in their respective role even those with little screen time my biggest praise has got to be for stellan skarsgård as the baron who is just creepy and unsettling every time he is onscreen    the story is also very intriguing and engaging there is a political aspect throughout this series that gives a game of thrones vibe there are alliances secret agendas and backstabbing that keeps you glued to the screen the movie also focuses a lot on worldbuilding with the noble families the voice power and the fremen a group of natives to the desert planet all of this lore make the world of dune feel more vibrant and unique similar to that of lord of the rings which managed to pull you in dune 2021 does the same denis does a great job in making all the politics and jargon stated easy to understand for the audience  there are also a large variety of characters in the film and denis does a phenomenal job in making it clear what their personality and agendas are the main character  paul atreides played by timothée chalamet has a clear character arc with the struggle of his power and him being next in line for house atreides most of his story arc gets a clear resolution by the end of the film    however dune 2021 is a part 1 that just covers half of the book and it shows most movies build up to an epic 3rd act but dune 2021 just ends midway through the 2nd act this ends up feeling very jarring to say the least as it doesnt end on a high note it is also incredibly slowpaced since a majority of the film is dedicated to just exposition and explanation of the world it results in a lot of moments that feel dull and sometimes boring additionally the fight scenes and action scenes are serviceable but could be improved apart from the fight scenes with duncan jason momoa the others are choreographed blandly and shot awkwardly as well     overall dune 2021 has a lot of love and effort put towards bringing the grand vision and scope of the novel to the big screen every frame in this film is eyecatching thanks to the cinematography costumes and set design that had a lot of thought put towards it nevertheless it is a very slow paced movie that might deter some people from enjoying it despite that i thoroughly enjoyed dune 2021 and it was no doubt one of the most memorable scifi movies to come out it would be a crime for this to not get a sequel
Oct 24 2021,neutral,i understand its set up for a peary 2 but they shouldve leaned on background more if they were going to make this such a short real world time
Oct 24 2021,positive,great cinematography well developed characters new twists to previous adaptations of the  frank herbert novel  im a huge dune fan and enjoyed the 2021 film immensely  looking forward to part 2  aloha
Oct 24 2021,positive,they graphics and actors were much better then the first two versions the only problem is the audio is very loud blocked out what they said at many points
Oct 24 2021,positive,it was beautifully filmed with a beautiful cast but i was expecting an incredibly different movie from the 1984 david lynch adaptation and it just didnt seem like a million percent better than that given all the hate for that one
Oct 24 2021,positive,can only say amazing must see cant wait for part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,great remake   likable cast  this first movie only reaches a third of the story of the original movie   disappointed that they didnt show a guild navigator and some scenes were too dark
Oct 24 2021,positive,wonderful interpretation of frank herberts first book  my only complaint is that it was an interpretation of the first half  waiting to see the second half will be painful
Oct 24 2021,positive,best soundtrack for a movie   best movie this year best special effects best acting and the theater in milford ia dune
Oct 24 2021,positive,a true epic of a film great acting by all the visuals were stunning i watched it at home in dolby vision i can only imagine how beautiful it is in imax hoping this is the beginning of a series of films academy award material 
Oct 24 2021,positive,dennis villeneuve did what others could not this adaptation is pure gold cant wait for the sequel
Oct 24 2021,negative,the movie was loud and it was hard to hear the actors
Oct 24 2021,positive,this movie exceeded my expectations been waiting for years for this movie to be made and it was stellar cannot wait for the next one id love 3 or 4 more plz if you are a sci fi nerd like me you will love it i want to cry this movie was just so beautiful and mesmerizing it was so well done it should be a best picture nominee and the acting was superb stunning obsessed with dune
Oct 24 2021,positive,best movie of the year hands down
Oct 24 2021,positive,having read the books years ago was helpful in understanding the plot line  special effects  graphics made this production much better than previous film of 80s  looking forward to the obvious sequels
Oct 24 2021,positive,i have been a tremendous fan of frank herbert my whole life and tremendously sad that someone couldnt capture the essence and emotional connection that his fans have to his work via film  this movie does an outstanding job in a very artistic way of interpreting herberts work without having to explain it  if you arent a fan of the novels the film may have some nuances lost on casual watchers but the artistic creativity of this film should appeal to all with its phenomenal landscapes fluid special effects and absolutely mind capturing music scoring  i was so happy to see this done right in my lifetime  huge thumbs up and thanks for doing this the right way
Oct 24 2021,positive,great special effects
Oct 24 2021,positive,great first part so glad they are taking the time to tell the whole story and not cramming it all into one look forward to part two
Oct 24 2021,positive,loved it   well written  perfectly cast bravo  we cant wait till part 2
Oct 24 2021,positive,sexy mofos in movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,ok now keep in mind i havent read any of the dune books and honestly i havent really read a lot of books that have been adapted into movies first this movie gave off a very nice ambience feeling but it almost feels like it was used to make this movie so iconic and incredible but i just never got that feeling while watching it i certainly enjoyed the setting the movie kinda portrays the desert as some sort of villain the time period and the plot of the movie helps back that up and gives it more meaning the music in this movie is also very good but it felt like it wasnt really used correctly almost like it didnt match the specific scene that it was played in it also contained very good fight sequences as little as there may be this movie felt like one of those movies that i would only watch once but not willingly rewatch it for fun in my opinion it failed to live up to my expectations which were originally going to be a full 1010 due to very good ratings from critics and audience reviews it is very overrated and i cant really see why this was such an anticipated movie maybe just because the books were great this movie stands with a 710 for me
Oct 24 2021,positive,well and faithful adaptation of the first half of the dune novel better than expected bring on part ii
Oct 24 2021,positive,good mix of the original story with a few changes that dont impact the story too muchgood acting and special effects that work
Oct 24 2021,positive,one of the best movies ive ever seen the incredible cinematography soundtrack complex and unique world building and characters the writers provide for us are truly captivating this is a distant future film that also feels grounded in the best of ways balancing everything i watched it in imax as it should be please lol and my eyes were glued to the screen the entire time its long run time was not noticeable and made me want it to never end i cannot wait for the rest of the series to come out to experience the complete story
Oct 24 2021,negative,slowest most boring movie much below the expectations
Oct 24 2021,positive,i enjoyed every bit of this movie and it passed my expectations will see it again shortly
Oct 24 2021,positive,1010 enjoyed this movie
Oct 24 2021,positive,i could almost feel sands in my mouth  the scenery is so beautiful 12 star deducted because the ending was a bit abrupt
Oct 24 2021,positive,im not sure what i watched a lot of visual stimulation and fantastic cinematography but the story was lacking and dull too long
Oct 24 2021,positive,i loved the books i hated the 1984 version so this one stacks up pretty well the first dune book was massive with a gazillion characters this film had to deal with all of that and did a really pretty good job of it im looking forward to the next film
Oct 24 2021,positive,amazing better than i remember the original being makes me want to go read the books
Oct 24 2021,positive,a really great adaption its as accurate as movies like the lord of the rings and with an artistic style that denis villeneuve is known for
Oct 23 2021,positive,dune was cinematic glory and stayed true to the original book from the casting to the cinematography to the soundtrack everything was executed to perfection given the length and amount of worldbuilding needed for viewers to understand the story  villeneuve successfully kept the pacing fast while also respecting the original storyline
Oct 23 2021,positive,great great movie  part one cant wait for the next ones to be released
Oct 23 2021,positive,a true epic in story and scale
Oct 23 2021,positive,this movie did an amazing job bringing to screen the greatest science fiction novel ever written sweeping visuals combined with engrossing sound create an ephemeral quality that suits the source material as well as philosophical core of the story the dreamer must awaken further the film  some impressive acting reveals the human side of characters with near superhuman abilities plus giant sand worms sword fights between electronically shielded warriors dragonfly like flying machines and dark clothed women who can bend the will of others with nothing other than the sound of their voicesor deal with the best fighters in handtohand combat are really really very very cool
Oct 23 2021,positive,beautifully shot  great casting  i cant wait for part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,too long for its own good
Oct 23 2021,positive,very good really liked it   i recommend it
Oct 23 2021,positive,i was instantly transported to another world in this film then swept along by its beauty and amazing performances recommended 
Oct 23 2021,positive,on second viewing i was much more forgiving both times in imax theater were a true cinematic experience the scale of this film apparent in the visual effects and the score and the composition of sets is enrapturing while some of my favorite aspects of the book the politicking is removed in order to streamline the narrative the first half of this story does still have an arc for paul it is clear in one of the movieonly story beats his visions of jamis were told that jamis will be a mentor figure helping paul to navigate and acclimate to desert survival the subversion of this that they end up doing 100 landed for me the essence of that vision came true just not in the way we thought it would the other major drawback of the film is the fact that ive envisioned a restructured adaptation that i thought would fit better but i cant fault them too much for doing a very faithful adaptation of the source material this film worked for me at the end of the day and im really excited for the story to continue
Oct 23 2021,positive,kept me at edge of seat just waiting for what was nextgreat identification of each group establishments and goal to function  the ending left me when is part 2  please do not keep us waiting
Oct 23 2021,positive,awesome absolutely awesome
Oct 23 2021,positive,please go support this movie in theatre  its a beautiful movie worthy of imax admission price   even though the movie isnt perfect at times hurried with a dense narrative it is the best science fiction film ive seen in at least a decade  easily surpassing the obvious cgi of star wars and other such offerings  you can feel love for the project by all involved  those unfamiliar with the source material should be warned that this is part 1 of what will be a two part film   so go in with an open mind and expect to be visually knocked over
Oct 23 2021,positive,loved it best time in a theater in a long time
Oct 23 2021,positive,i liked the look and feel reminds me of what i saw as i read the book 20 years ago
Oct 23 2021,positive,absolutely phenomenal storytelling dune fans i think we finally have the one
Oct 23 2021,negative,an empty film with empty characters and very boring story all told this was painfull to endure at 2 hours and 36 minutes you will suffer if you choose to watch this garbage film that perhaps is the most boring film ever made and the biggest waste of 2 hours and 36 minutes of precious time please avoid this garbage film and do not believe the paid 5 star reviews i saw the previews and great cast and thought it would be awesomei was dead wrong avoid
Oct 23 2021,positive,best movie ive seen in 2021 a must watch if youre a fan of scifi
Oct 23 2021,positive,action packed and was very close to the original movie  brought back great memories of watching the original one with family
Oct 23 2021,positive,ridiculously good i havent looked it up but the special effects alone must have cost more than most movies ever make
Oct 23 2021,positive,enjoyable take no slogging internal monologue instead they relied on the actors to show you what they were feeling or thinking through body language if you read the book the easter eggs are everywhere for you to pick up on and enjoy
Oct 23 2021,positive,one of the most immersive viewing experiences ive ever had at the movie theater
Oct 23 2021,positive,denis villeneuve has raised the bar for what cinema should be dune for todays generation is akin to what films like benhur or ten commandments were to the golden age of hollywood the level of detail is incomparable as for the story villeneuve has perfectly adapted it for the big screen do yourselves a favor see dune in imax
Oct 23 2021,positive,spectacular true to the book and the liberties taken served the flow of the film this is meant to be watched on the big screen
Oct 23 2021,positive,everyone involved with this film ate and left absolutely no crumbs thank you to all of you ill be here patiently waiting for part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,loved it see it on the big screen
Oct 23 2021,positive,they finally got it right the love story is front a center a few minor things paul didnt appear to cry after killing the fermanimportant in solidifying his position with the fremen never imagined liet as female and felt jessica was portrayed as more emotional than i ever imaginedbut then its been 40 years since i last read the book so maybe its time for a rereading looking forward to reading the new book on lady jessicaand the second graphic novel
Oct 23 2021,positive,expertly shot but too many short random scenes for over half the film
Oct 23 2021,positive,it was obviously setting up the saga and i think that was achieved i am looking forward to the sequels
Oct 23 2021,positive,excellent finally does the book justice waiting expectantly for the 2nd part and cant urge folks to see this enough especially if you read the book a visual masterpiece
Oct 23 2021,positive,just another great from villeneuve
Oct 23 2021,negative,this was a humorless joyless shot for shot reshoot of the 80s film they only stretched out the boring parts so they can turn this into a two part series the musical score for the film was dreadfully over dramatic
Oct 23 2021,positive,everything about this movie was amazing see it on the big screen imax if you can i will be going again
Oct 23 2021,positive,the movie is wonderfully adapted for the cinema from a complex book thats simplified in a way that reminds me of the fellowship of the ring hopefully the trend continues with the sequals
Oct 23 2021,positive,dune is an interesting movie it focuses more on the story aspect than action sequences i enjoyed the film but its a one time movie for me overall i wouldnt watch this again by choice
Oct 23 2021,positive,see it in the theater epic vistas and pretty true to novel worth the visit
Oct 23 2021,positive,best movie ive seen in the last few years
Oct 23 2021,positive,im a huge fan of the dune book series and have been disappointed by the various movie and short series iterations because the source material is so rich and dense i had little hope that it could effectively translate to the screen both big and small i must say this movie is visually stunning and it hits the mark on the world building front i will be so vexed if there isnt a part 2 to close out this particular storyline 
Oct 23 2021,negative,kinda what i expected  loved the 80s movie  yes the effects were better  jason momoa is a great hero and batista is a fantastic villain  however chalamet isnt the right actor for this role neither is zendaya  both were terrible for their respective role  my kids had no idea what was going on because they didnt explain anything too much slow mo artistic effect  everything was dark pretty much what i was expecting disappointment reboot
Oct 23 2021,positive,way better than the book
Oct 23 2021,positive,amazing adaption   im so happy already at the first minute i was looking at my husband with a face like what the hell  love the story and the director made it perfectly so worthed   the soundtrack is beyond this world the actors the voices they act so powerful all the glimpses even in the sand is mesmerizing    is now my favorite movie of all time
Oct 23 2021,positive,a brilliant and faithful adaptation of the section of the book they decided to put into this first part
Oct 23 2021,positive,long time dune fan and reader been waiting for decades for a adaptation that respects the book and can capture the visuals i had in my head when reading this movie is perfection insanely beautiful cinematography the visuals are flawless i will never need to watch the 1984 dune again to satisfy a dune hankering now very anxious to the next one
Oct 23 2021,positive,third time was even better this was my third time experiencing this scifi epic masterpiece and must say it has gotten better with every viewing i absolutely love this film everything about it is grade a material deserving of every oscar it can muster my favorite film of the year thus far
Oct 23 2021,positive,wish i could see part two now
Oct 23 2021,positive,honestly it felt less like an adaptation of the first half of the novel and more like watching a threehour documentary on the true events behind it in 3d i will say that it was consistently engrossing both on a visual level and in the attention to detail especially for someone obsessively familiar with the source material  not unlike watching say three good hours of game of thrones but it wasnt terribly exciting  too many story beats fall disturbingly flat and the dialogue is so deadpan it almost feels selfconscious the most pleasant surprise for me was sharon duncanbrewster as kynes the character has a bigger role than in the book played with so much heart she practically carries the film the rest of the cast by comparison feels like their personality was suckedout through their eyeballs skarsgards baron was not just an homage to brandos kurtz but a blatant ripoff and not a lot else all in all its as if villeneuve was so terrified of lynchs quirky shakespearean take on the property and particularly of its polarizing effects that he backed himself into the corner of playing suffocatingly safe with it the result is a meditative nofrills interpretation that covers the basics but leaves color and life at the door and thats a shame
Oct 23 2021,positive,the quality of the special effects made you feel like you were in the movie  the drawback is that it leaves you at the rising action
Oct 23 2021,negative,too complicated the beginning has too much information for a casual person the rest of the movie is just pretentious and abuses of excessive action scenes its is still fun though but its overhyped
Oct 23 2021,positive,from the start to the finish this movie was well written a compelling narrative on the raw version of power and intrigue i will definitely watch this again a few more times the actors well suited for their roles and the cliff hanger belies a well trodden path for sequels a must watch 
Oct 23 2021,positive,was left overwhelmed by visuals and sound design but sadly underwhelmed overall its by far the best screen adaptation and has some memorable moments however the ensemble cast fails to have any chemistry and the film as a whole i felt lacked any emotional connection to its characters and their own story arcs although granted this is only part one of the first novel   hans zimmers score is the highlight of the film as well as the stunning cinematography  despite the muted and desaturated tones throughout  the onscreen scale is however hugely impressive on imax and transports you into frank herberts visionary worlds  hoping that a second part will tie up those character arcs and provide some quicker pacing to round off the best on screen adaptation of the novel
Oct 23 2021,positive,it was so good i saw it back to back days
Oct 23 2021,positive,compelling story well written and acted
Oct 23 2021,positive,true to book sets acting excellent  after all these years so glad to see so well done   o
Oct 23 2021,positive,they got it right this time i cant wait for part 2 great movie
Oct 23 2021,positive,a big thrilling epic worth it
Oct 23 2021,positive,i loved this movie  the only thing i didnt like was that it wasnt long enough      they do such an amazing job of world building its like being taken there      so good that they didnt use green screens and used real locations and massive sets instead  the final product is so much the better for it    all kinds of mystery epic visions moody music and a balance of action with story    very happy theyre making a part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,read the book as a teenager and anxiously awaited the first movie  seen every adaptation since the first 3 minutes were annoying and gave me concern  it improved dramatically from there
Oct 23 2021,positive,amazing movie music and sounds were amazing
Oct 23 2021,positive,amazing totally mindblowing
Oct 23 2021,positive,i loved the way they adapted this massive book into this movie i totally like how it will be in multiple parts because of how big it is i feel like the actors were good and if i had to critique something it would be that some things werent explained well and such but overall it was good
Oct 23 2021,positive,this movie is awesome fantastic acting and the cinematography is breath taking see this on the biggest screen possible
Oct 23 2021,positive,the film feels like the books i read 35 years ago
Oct 23 2021,positive,absolutely incredible i cannot wait to watch it again
Oct 23 2021,negative,i walked out after one hour
Oct 23 2021,positive,saw it on a dolby atmos amc big screen and on hbo max perfect movie considering the source material 55 cant wait for part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,this movie is definitely worth your time ive watched 3 times between the theater and hbo max and each time it gets better im not a huge dune fan nor am i someone who rewatches movies right away but this movie is so big i had to see all the things i was unclear about again ive never seen a world so alien represented in film every shot is just a study in world building dune is a tough story to tackle and you come away feeling like not much was cut in writing the script everything is there and despite the 25 hour run time i found myself wishing there was more to it i wont get into much else but will definitely say this is really something to see and i personally found more detail in watching it at home on a large high def screen but the theater was great too ps dont bother with the 3d it just blurred the incredible detail and imagery
Oct 23 2021,negative,minute movie spends 100 minutes of it with long drawn out shots that tries too hard to be like christopher nolan without the great script and character development you know you have a problem this rendition of dune is just horrible dune is the original got the politics the characters the spice are all things that make dune special and all the things this movie lacks having paul portrayed as a scared emo frail teen is pathetic and a far cry from the arrogant playboy prince who had to grow up what is most criminal is how horribly utilized and enveloped skarsgards baron was this character had all but 10 lines its pathetic key plots twists and dialogue from the book that made the book special are non existent to say the least where is irulan where is the emperor shadam the spacing guild all these things make dune the spice must flow was never once mentioned spice is the key and its an afterthought here if you think this movie is good you should absolutely rethink your life and yes i will be toxic because this movie is just boring if you want a decent video representation of dune watch the old sci fi miniseries
Oct 23 2021,positive,visually stunning and epic
Oct 23 2021,positive,truly loved this adaption of dune i cant wait to see the rest of the story unfold
Oct 23 2021,positive,not having seen the original lynch incarnation i like the way the story kind of explained the world and players of arrakis will be very disappointed if part 2 isnt greenlit
Oct 23 2021,positive,beautiful movie extremely well made amazing soundtrack amazing costumes and most of all it follows the spirit of the book frank herbert would enjoy this as opposed to asimov who is probably rolling in his grave seeing the horrible random foundation series
Oct 23 2021,positive,this spectacularly minimalistic audibly stunning and full of distinctive style masterpiece gives hope not only for a terrific franchise but also book adaptations in general
Oct 23 2021,positive,at last a noble adaptation of one my favorite stories
Oct 23 2021,positive,this movie deserves a sequel
Oct 23 2021,positive,absolutely amazing and captivating brilliantly cast loved the plot pace and the length of the film the longer the better cant wait for part two i really hope they end up continuing it and many more continuation films to follow safe to say this is definitely one of the top films of the year if not the best film
Oct 23 2021,positive,i had not seen a 3d movie in a long time better than i remembered but still sort of dark that could be the movie itself the movie was good though a bit slow in parts long time sitting as it was almost 25 hours story was good but i ill need to read the book to see if the movie was true to it enjoyed despite the draw backs worth seeing to me i do wonder what it would look like on a big good quality tv
Oct 23 2021,positive,the whole experience the fashion of the way the movie was shown characters are great overall the movie was fantastic
Oct 23 2021,positive,i read dune by frank herbert when i was 11 so my only issue is that it wasnt the whole book i could have watched 2 more hours with out a problem the wait will be agony
Oct 23 2021,positive,loved it granted they took liberties with the story line but acting was srrong effects amazing
Oct 23 2021,positive,i dont see how it couldve been better phenomenal film we need part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,first of all this not a science fiction movie but rather  an epic film a lineal descendant of  epics from ben hur and spartacus to lawrence of arabia and gladiator serious props to denis villeneuve for pulling this off    there is genius in the writing the film actually develops as opposed to jump starting allowing the viewer to become immersed performances are excelllent all around as are the cinematography set decoration and costumes special props to hans zimmer for creating a score that amplifies the mood and feel of each scene     not sure how verify ive seen it but i saw yesterday at santikos embassy theatre in san antonio and im watching it again now on hbo max    viewers expecting a rambunctious scifi flick may be a little disappointed at first but if they hang in they will be rewarded with a remarkable voyage in and through the world that frank herbert created
Oct 23 2021,positive,its an amazing film  visually stunning  the story was slow building up but it followed the book to a tee minus a few minor differences  but that will not bother you too much unless you are a real dune nerd i would not be surprised if that movie was nominated for the best picture oscar
Oct 23 2021,positive,lots of similarities to star wars sarah ferguson is a stand out
Oct 23 2021,positive,my coworker saw the movie at the late night premier and told me it was fantastic and he read the book i hate it when people lie to me  i went and saw it for myself and now i hate that he told me the truth after watching the movie i went out to buy the book so i can get ahead  fantastic job everyone
Oct 23 2021,positive,i was not expecting to be so into the movie it did not feel like 2 hours and 30 min its visually stunning and great cast
Oct 23 2021,positive,first off i have not read the dune books or seen the 1984 version of the film coming into watching this i was quite intimidated however from the moment the film started i couldnt take my eyes off the screen the beauty of the landscape and use of colors hooks you in to pay attention to the story wonderfully done and amazing set up for the sequel
Oct 23 2021,positive,absolutely a masterpiece
Oct 23 2021,positive,really looking forward to the rest of this series now
Oct 23 2021,positive,incredible visual spectacle very faithful adaptation of the book if you are not familiar with the book you will be lost for those who know the story this movie ends way too soon when it ended i could not believe 2 hours had passed hungry for more
Oct 23 2021,positive,just excitement from start to finish
Oct 23 2021,positive,great movie a bit long but not in a bad way in a great novel way looking forward to the next one
Oct 23 2021,positive,cant wait for part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,the only reason i didnt give it a lower score was because of the last 45 minutes of the movie  the reason i didnt give it a higher score was the first hour and a half  last 45 minutes it was about an 8 and the beginning just laboured on and on
Oct 23 2021,positive,i loved it loyal to the novel but also an epic spectacle movie with slightly more humanity than  herberts version which grounds it the perfect balance
Oct 23 2021,negative,i really wish denis villeneuve had at least read the book most of the iconic scenes that make dune such a classic were stripped of all meaning they managed to make the hand in the pain box scene boring  the rest of the movie was filled with slow motion shots of people staring ever so meaningfully
Oct 23 2021,positive,the visuals were stunning they followed the book very closely loved it looking forward to part two
Oct 23 2021,positive,gorgeous visuals legendary soundtrack  its a feast for the senses all around  not exactly familiar with dune lore myself but i think we got so much more packed for us   if anything can challenge the might of the original tlotr trilogy this might be it
Oct 23 2021,negative,i am so tired of hollywood trying to turn everything into a decades long franchise  just make a friggin movie already and stop trying to hold us hostage two and a half hours of cgi under saturated soft focus bloated scenes just tell the story already and let us get on with our lives at this pace it will take them 4 movies just to cover the first book and im sorry but this one was way too bad to watch that many more especially with this cast although theyve already killed off most off the over used actors so they will have to get a whole new crop of over used actors for the next oneand kill them off  at least they stayed somewhat true to the book but where they veered off it was obviously to bloat the story line because those scenes added nothing and just made me scream get on with it already but they didnt listen and i certainly wont be listening in anticipation for the next chapters arrival this isnt 1935 and im not going to the theater every saturday to see the next capture of dune and the rocketmen on the planet of spice serials were a cheesy and sleazy way to fill seats then and they are a sleazy way to try to fill seats now just tell the story in two hours preferable there are plenty of other dune books waiting for you to screw up
Oct 23 2021,positive,i had high expectations and it exceeded them really captured the feel and essence of the first half the the book
Oct 23 2021,positive,tough to make a full narrative with half a book which is probably why it seemed to slow towards the end but overall dune was a great start to the franchise and i wouldve watched 10 hours straight if it were released as an hbonetflix series  although then i supposed i wouldnt have got to enjoy the epic imax experience
Oct 23 2021,positive,great visual effects  good acting  having read the book would have helped follow the plots  could be shorter without so many wordless closeups of faces  some of the dialog was annoyingly unintelligible
Oct 23 2021,positive,awesome movie super sfx good start on the dune series
Oct 23 2021,positive,part one is the bomb cant wait for part two
Oct 23 2021,positive,the best science fiction movie form avatar 2 hours and a half and i dont fille the past of the timethis movie is a must see of 2021
Oct 23 2021,positive,a better take on the source material great pace with lots of actions the only grip two grips i have is that some scenes were too dark this however could have been my theater the second is that we dont know if warner bros will greenlight the second part i hope they do
Oct 23 2021,positive,great looking movie and great soundtrack 
Oct 23 2021,positive,good combination of story and action
Oct 23 2021,positive,loved the movie as a fan of the books it was exactly what i was hoping for going to watch it again on hbo soon but it was definitely one to see in the theater
Oct 23 2021,positive,a movie of the quality you just dont see anymore in hollywood 1010 best epic since lotr
Oct 23 2021,negative,story solid graphics and acting a just needed more big action scenes as it drug a little in several parts
Oct 23 2021,positive,i loved this movie i know nothing about dune  but i cant wait till i can see part two the film is beautiful and stunning 
Oct 23 2021,positive,very entertaining and visually stunning could have been 20 mins shorter but i definitely loved the universe and cant wait for the next one
Oct 23 2021,positive,the visual effects were outstanding so real and lifelike award worthy
Oct 23 2021,positive,perfect ready for part 2 so well done
Oct 23 2021,positive,way better than the 1980s version visually outstanding i wasnt sure how good it would be but i was pleasantly surprised but you need to know this is only part one movie runs about 3 hours but it goes by quickly
Oct 23 2021,positive,steadily led by denis villeneuve part one of dune actually uncovers the appeal of frank herberts visionary novel by letting the characters thoughts stay thoughts and letting the movie screen do what its meant to to tell an epic scifi story with plenty of its own layers and believably astonishing visuals
Oct 23 2021,positive,dune greatly lacks character development and instead focuses its dialogue on exposition much of which is unnecessary  for as expansive of a lore the story establishes the script fails to expand upon the characters beyond their role in the plot  this is especially the case for paul the main protagonist  his motivations and internal struggle are presented as not much more than a blank canvas  this lack of investment in characters leaves all conflict in the story feeling void of significance
Oct 23 2021,positive,an exciting adventure into a unique fictional world
Oct 23 2021,positive,you can tell the director is a fan of the source material the visuals are incredible bold yet very conscious of herberts original vision casting is spot on and the run time feels full without dragging on lynchs version will always have a place in my heart but this is highly reccomended
Oct 23 2021,positive,absolute best movie ive seen in years intelligent plot well acted spectacular computer aided graphics dont worry about the length of the movie
Oct 23 2021,positive,a true and faithful adaptation of the novel it fixes many of the mistakes of the david lynch version hopefully the franchise in the making weve been waiting for
Oct 23 2021,negative,this movie is really really bad i have no idea how critics could still bluster over it i eventually turned it off
Oct 23 2021,positive,everything about dune i wanted timothy is just going to keep getting better and better you guy is awesome
Oct 23 2021,positive,good shit  moved much more swiftly than i expected without trying to cover too much ground
Oct 23 2021,positive,loved it cant wait to see part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,so true to the book id give it 10 stars if i could
Oct 23 2021,negative,this is the worst of the three versions ive seen its a waste of money and time
Oct 23 2021,positive,its an interesting movie and looking forward to part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,awesome  cant wait for part 2and then children of dune and dune messiah
Oct 23 2021,positive,it was done beautifully 
Oct 23 2021,positive,holy smokes by far such a great movie that does complete justice to the book the visuals are stunning the score is a not so distant allusion to blade runner 2049 but with more middle eastern influence  if you are a fan of the book you will absolutely enjoy and revel in this ride if you are not read the book there is so much inner dialogue from the book that fills in the gaps you dont get to see in the more subtle aspects of film one of the best films ive seen in a long time and i cant wait for part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,loved it its really good
Oct 23 2021,positive,this movie is epic does not feel like 25 hours at all ends where the book does for the first half and follows it closely throughout its run time i cant wait for the second part
Oct 23 2021,positive,great film ready for part 2
Oct 23 2021,negative,it was horrible it was all about loud sounds and monochromatic cinema photography  had i known it was a two part movie i never would have wasted the money it doesnt hold a candle to the original
Oct 23 2021,positive,this was a great book i read 50 years ago and multiple times since the movie is perfect it was directed by a big fan of the book and it shows followed the book very well and captured the spiritual emotional and vastness of the epic would be a great movie even without reading the book
Oct 23 2021,positive,stunning riveting perfect
Oct 23 2021,positive,its good but lynch did more with less
Oct 23 2021,positive,very good movie looking forward to pt 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,very well done its quite clear star wars copied this book and story
Oct 23 2021,positive,to say it is a triumph of cinema would not do it justice it is a wondrous slightly dystopic space opera the likes of which you have never seen jessica paul duncan every character is so good in this world building par excellence 9510
Oct 23 2021,positive,excellent adaptation from one of the best but one of the most difficult science fiction stories ever written
Oct 23 2021,negative,disappointing looked great for the most part but felt very flat this is a difficult story to bring to the big screen but this felt like a dumbeddown version very surface only  no depth
Oct 23 2021,positive,the visuals and cinematography were great the acting was amazing but there were a few casting decisions i would have changed there was something missing however like the connections between the characters the ending was also unsatisfying i understand why they ended the movie at  that point but it just didnt feel right the next two movies are sure to be better and will do the book justice this one is really just felt like a set up to the other two
Oct 23 2021,positive,epic  but they better make the sequel
Oct 23 2021,positive,this movie will go down in history as one of the greatest movies in the past few years well done well done
Oct 23 2021,positive,this film magnificently tells the beginning of the story of a young man and his journey into fulfilling his destiny the use of sound and the times where it was dropped expertly enhanced tension emphasizing drama highlighting important segments visually the film used light perfectly to contribute to the flow of the story and once again highlight important scenes or to disruptdistort your perspective on purpose overall it is a marvelous film that must be experienced in theater if at all possible
Oct 23 2021,negative,sad to report dune didnt work for me at all as with villeneuves last effort the eyecandy is amazing the film looks like the best of chris foss and moebius brought to life the acting is top notch and the cast all look the part the score is wonderful but the story has been stripped so bare that most of herberts ideas are missing and the plot is unexplained to the point of incomprehensibility at least to those who havent previously read the novel   the format has been changed from an intricate ensemble parable about power religion and ecology into a simple heros journey told through the eyes of paul atreides yet somehow despite leaving out massive chunks of the story the tragic rift of leto and jessica the emperor princess irulan the mentats the weirding way the spicing guild and feydrautha are only some of whats missing villeneuve only manages to cover a third of the novel in a run time twenty minutes longer than david lynchs complete telling   the absence of key story elements removes the rationales for and the reasons to care about most of the twists and turns in the plot so much of the run time is devoted to vistas and fight scenes and so little to establishing the motivations of the many secondary characters that none of their anger betrayals and sacrifices carry any genuine emotional heft the harkonnen originally complex characters with plenty of issues of their own have been reduced to saturday morning cartoon villains worthy of an episode of heman and i found the greatly reduced role of jessica one of the first great female characters of science fiction to be particularly painful although arguably expected given the directors difficult track record with misogyny much debated when br2049 came out   to my mind this wasnt really dune so much as a very nicely shot big dumb hollywood action movie inspired by the imagery of dune they did what they did with the lord of the rings only to a much greater extent extract the bits  that a thirteenyearold boy would consider cool from a thoughtful themeled story but whereas peter jackson kept enough tolkien in his story to keep the sprit intact here they binned literally everything that made dune the important book it is what remains is a sf adventure as glorious but empty as the desert it depicts   i dont buy the argument that dune is inherently unfilmable its politics are no more complex than game of thrones and its ideas are no more weird and intellectual than 2001 or arrivals or bladerunners we know it can be done from david lynchs flawed masterpiece and the credible miniseries they just didnt really try
Oct 23 2021,positive,epic feel that captures the essence of the novel with great pacing and beautiful imagery worth seeing on a truly large screen
Oct 23 2021,positive,a great adaptation of the classic and epic
Oct 23 2021,positive,if youre a fan of the book youre gonna love it  really well done   if you have never read them its hard to say if it translates the same way but the production is fantastic and the visuals are stunning  absolutely must see in the biggest theater you can find
Oct 23 2021,positive,best film adaptation and world building ive seen since lotr acting was on point filmography was beautiful music was phenomenal the story was accessible to those unfamiliar with the world but also spot on for those who are
Oct 23 2021,positive,great part 1 now get part 2 going please
Oct 23 2021,positive,outstanding and visually stunning
Oct 23 2021,positive,this is as epic as lord of the rings and as intentness as game of thrones
Oct 23 2021,positive,epic scififantasy visuals stays true to the novel
Oct 23 2021,positive,its exactly as huge and beautiful as it should be and it also has that mystical feeling which attract us to this story and even though my only fear was that it wouldnt be selfcontained which it definetely isnt its more than enough to keep me thrilled for a year or more
Oct 23 2021,positive,absolutely incredible i dont even have words to describe it
Oct 23 2021,positive,follows the books which captures you the first 5 minutes and rides you to the end
Oct 23 2021,positive,really liked it  it was gorgeous to look at incredibly true to the book the locations were phenomenal and just the kind of diversion we all need now
Oct 23 2021,positive,awesome movie i hope part 2 comes sooner than later
Oct 23 2021,positive,big movie it needs to be seen on a theater big screen to fully appreciate its beauty    acting is very good the actual plot line for those who have not read the book like me was a bit difficult to follow so i took off a half star for example why are spices such a big deal      when is part 2 supposed to be released
Oct 23 2021,positive,if youre a fan of the original this one is better  if youre new to the world of dune this is an excellent place to start
Oct 23 2021,positive,phenomenal everything i could have hoped for in a dune adaptation the visuals were eye candy the whole way through and the acting was fantastic im going to see it several more times to help boost box office revenue to help green light the sequel
Oct 23 2021,positive,if you havent read dune you might have some trouble following it but i had and thoroughly enjoyed it  i thought the action scenes were good but the acting was even better  i cant wait until the sequel
Oct 23 2021,positive,new star warses 0 dune 100 beautiful movie
Oct 23 2021,positive,very interesting and keeps your attention
Oct 23 2021,positive,liked visually appealing with a great cast some very good drama music was haunting but worked very well disliked way too long and dragged at many times a few times i struggled to not dose off
Oct 23 2021,positive,amazing adaptation of an incredible book cant wait for part 2 
Oct 23 2021,positive,beautifully shot film keeps you engage from first to final frame
Oct 23 2021,positive,man there sure were a lot of dunes in that movie
Oct 23 2021,positive,great approach to the feel of the novels cant wait for the next installment
Oct 23 2021,negative,beautiful movie but void of any personality
Oct 23 2021,positive,accurate to the book but kinda slow maybe cause its only part 1 and setting the stage overall good movie
Oct 23 2021,positive,downright fantastic as a lover of the book i came into this semi nervous i couldnt have been happier with how it ended up the grand scope and scale of the film is breath taking zimmers score is absolutely fitting to the world that villeneuve brought to the screen timothy chalamet brings the thunder as paul he brings a presence that is demanding and yet still subtle the interactions between him and rebecca ferguson are astounding they can say so much without a single word being said i loved it guys go see it in theaters its the best way to view this bad boy 
Oct 23 2021,positive,great actors and visually beautiful but the story didnt captivate me a bit boring
Oct 23 2021,positive,best movie ive seen in a long time
Oct 23 2021,positive,a visual marvel blended expertly with sound storytelling the only bad part about dune 2021 is that you will want more after its 155 minute run time make sure to watch on imax for the full experience also if youre old enough an adult beverage is an excellent companion to the movie somehow it makes everything more intense and epic
Oct 23 2021,positive,i have mixed feelings about this movie as someone who read the book i can understand the difficulty in trying to determine which pertinent details should be the focus of a film and having to rush some things in their explanation but the scene setting should not be one of those things i thought the scenery of caladan was too gray and dreary for a place that was referred to as one of flowing water and greenery from the abundance of rain certainly the scenery for their time on that planet could have been less bland even the waters were dreary and it seemed like it wouldnt have been a hardship to leave a place if it were always so gray as for arrakis i get that scifi movies make everything superindustrial but hollywood has become very onesided in portraying such scenes as blocklooking behemoths of steel i cant fathom why better imagination cannot come up with futuristic worlds that arent anything other than blocks of steel  even in a harsh world     all of the male actors were great and portrayed their characters well especially chalamet as muad dib id never seen this  young man before and he played a fantastic protagonist i was disappointed in the portrayal of lady jessica she is a major character and  in this first installment of the film the lead female i do like rebecca ferguson but she was either not the right person for the role or her depiction needed to change lady jessica is a beauty but more than that strongwilled and one tough cookie she was portrayed quite the opposite in the film she was bland in appearance wearing her hair in a formal tight knot and drab dark clothes and i felt she was portrayed as an emotionally weak woman as compared to her character in the book  chani came in very close to the endnot enough screen time of her character for me to have an opinion of her portrayal in this first installment
Oct 23 2021,positive,the most visually rich movie ive seen in years
Oct 23 2021,positive,amazing movie  highly recommend seeing it at a movie  the visuals deserve to be seen on the biggest screen possible
Oct 23 2021,positive,this is one of the best films ive ever seen the cinema experience is on another level yes it doesnt have a proper ending but this is just part 1 when part 2 releases is going to be a whole experience i wish i could watch both parts on the theater at the same time but for the moment this is a really good movie maybe it could be confusing to new audience but after you get the context of whats happening youll enjoy it so much  watch it on the theater i believe thats how you can really feel the magic of the film
Oct 23 2021,positive,denis villenueves adaptation of frank herberts scifi epic was an incredibly rewarding experience for those who have read the novel its an experience that is definitely made for the big screen
Oct 23 2021,negative,villeneuves dune mother of all clichés    the 1966 frank herbert novel had it all or all that seemed then and still seems now to encompass what all is emperor baron duke prodigal sonwitches aliens a seductress ginormous extragalactic annelids an lifeenhancing yet addictive panacea armies galore in battle upon battle both large and small et cetera et cetera and so forth    the 2021 film adaptation of the first half to twothirds of the book is both less and more its the lord of the rings without sass star wars without quirkiness a pompous overblown grandiosity that takes itself way too seriously spice aka melange is its one ring or force intended to demonstrate that ownership of what generates unsurpassed wealth equals power equals control and to think i never knew that    the production design and lighting arent just atmospherically dark theyre so darn dark that i had to turn out all the lights just to see the film and you know what they say once you turn out the lights the partys over never truer than here    the hans zimmer soundtrack sucks out all the breathable oxygen overbearing seemingly omnipresent tuvan throat singing  a technique of which im usually quite fond  is reminiscent of the twin peaks mood music by angelo badalamenti but utterly bereft of charm like the postmid 80s saturday night live it doesnt know when to stop hans baby quit hitting us over the head with dunes inept attempts at animistic spirituality your exotic walls of sound cannot rescue this second apocalypse now 37 years after david lynchs apocalypse then    this foolmetwiceshameonme cinematic adaptation of a popular gothic fantasy novel masquerading as science fiction is proof positive that frank herberts game of thrones preincarnation a long time from now in a galaxy whoknowswhere isnt so much unfilmable as it is actually a chimera of inexcusable conceit world building alone in science fiction novels doesnt make those stories science fiction neither does situating them elsewhen nor piling on the swordplay and gore until our own bile rises in involuntary intolerance    for all you young aging and agèd duneatics give it up id advise yall to satisfy yourselves with the 2001 dune video game except it crashed and burned too just like villeneuves did  i mean will
Oct 23 2021,positive,i really liked it but expected more raw feeling it feels like a beautiful film i should care a bit more about dialog too sterile and timothée chalamet was a mis cast i am a super fan of dune  i enjoyed this but frankly it could have been so much more with just a bit more thought and consideration to building the characters non dune fans will struggle
Oct 23 2021,positive,probably the most faithful book adaption ever made cant wait for part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,this movie is incredible and a must see in my opinion as a fan of the book i was blown away at how true to the book this movie was additionally the score is hans zimmer at his best the visuals are stunning the fight scenes fun to watch the acting top notch this is the best movie i have seen in a long time
Oct 23 2021,positive,unbelievable only half the story but truly a great scifi film that will stand the test of time
Oct 23 2021,positive,awesome awesome awesome great acting visuals story i will be devastated if the sequel isnt made firefly level devastated
Oct 23 2021,positive,this movie was a masterpiece given the strength of its overall experience the performance of timothee chalamet bolstered an already strong and interesting protagonist complete with compelling story captivating score and worldbuilding that is great in scope and will surely be appreciated for years to come
Oct 23 2021,positive,perfect flow easy for those who arent familiar with the dune series amazing sound superb acting and a true epic
Oct 23 2021,positive,everything ive waited for since reading the book a half century ago and more perfectly cast visually stunning in imax it blew me away even more the 2nd time
Oct 23 2021,neutral,special effects were excellent scenes with jason momoa were great in fact his character came across as believable otherwise its was slow and acting not up to par i still prefer 1984 version
Oct 23 2021,positive,loved the visuals and soundtrack felt a little too long but there better be a sequel
Oct 23 2021,positive,very well made the only thing i didnt like is they dont advertise it as a 2 movie series so when the title came on screen i was not prepared to see dune part one could have been a little more transparent in that department other than that the movie was amazing i would go back and see it a second time
Oct 23 2021,positive,visuals are greatstory is interestingmore development of characters would have been fine
Oct 23 2021,positive,seeing book come alive  so fiction
Oct 23 2021,negative,so bad and boring never read the books now i dont care too harry potter and the lord of the rings are still the best books adapted to screen
Oct 23 2021,positive,the sound and cinematography were fantastic
Oct 23 2021,positive,breathtaking great sort and great effects fight scenes were awesome cinematography was outstanding cant wait for the next one
Oct 23 2021,positive,i loved it enough said the duke of atreides acting was the only disappointment in the entire film
Oct 23 2021,positive,i loved how the movie passed by quickly even though it was 2 hours and 35 minutes long but i disliked how zendaya wasnt really in the movie until the end
Oct 23 2021,neutral,where is the rest of the story
Oct 23 2021,positive,beautiful film  very wise cinematic pacing  if the pacing were faster it wouldve lost or bored me   this feels like the right 1st film to make allowing you to possibly get more complicated as the story continues in a sequel  it really had a cool tone and i was happy to be in this epic new world
Oct 23 2021,negative,while the visuals were nice  theres not much more  sure the actor performances were good but villeneuve totally screwed this movie up     too many departures from the book to list  soooo many   the barons character was only for show  he was the main harkonnen  he shouldve had quadruple the number of lines   wheres the emperor   wheres the princess   wheres feyd  hes a main character of the damn book   why not show the spacing guild  not a single glimpse    why are the mentats lips stained in straight lines  they drink the juice of sapho  that stains their lips  its not makeup  theyre supposed to be human computers   did any of their acting convey that  nope    ultimately the characters are shallow not so in the book  this movie relies heavily on the visuals but much of the background  explanation is not given      ughhhthis movie was terrible  go watch the long version of david lynchs version for a much more enlightening watch  if you read the book you too will see that this movie should be admonished
Oct 23 2021,positive,the way the story unfolds itself is addicting the visions make the movie mysterious leave you guessing the suspense the soundtracks the cinematics 55 from me
Oct 23 2021,positive,in general they remain true to the novel looking forward to seeing chapters 2  3
Oct 23 2021,positive,the start of an unforgettable trilogy
Oct 23 2021,positive,its a good movie the universe is really interesting but the movie is just a big teaser for a potential sequel like mortal kombat if the movie works of course
Oct 23 2021,positive,great job cant wait for part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,dune a master piece the reason we go to the movies in caliber with lord of the rings
Oct 23 2021,positive,it was very interesting and intense we will come back to see part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,a great start to a film series adaptation of fune from villeneuve and the team working on this movie worth a watch 100 percent if you like scifi at all
Oct 23 2021,negative,too slow and long in the beginning
Oct 23 2021,positive,exactly what i wished for highly recommend seeing it in a theatre
Oct 23 2021,positive,at two and a half hours i thought it was going to be a slog but ive felt more burdened by some 90 minute movies  the tome is super serious but it still moves along really well  my only gripe is that its only a partial movie and i have no idea if well get the rest of it  i really hope that we do
Oct 23 2021,positive,magnificent adaptation faithful to the text and spirit of the original
Oct 23 2021,neutral,long and fairly boring could have been condensed in half without cutting out any plot acting and score were good
Oct 23 2021,positive,the most incredible movie ive seen in a long time
Oct 23 2021,positive,everything i dreamt it would be
Oct 23 2021,positive,great directing excellent cast excellent story line better than the original movie a must see
Oct 23 2021,positive,having seen the previous incarnations of this story and read the book i found this version better in most ways but still lacking  it seemed hollow in some way i cant quite yet say how  they purposely hit all the critical dialogue showed all the important scenes most of the acting was spot on and the tech felt as if it was right off herberts pages  there was something missing i cant quite describe like a beautiful house with marble floors wood panel walls fine furniturebut still lacks some spark or soul to make it feel complete  maybe it wastoo big  the house was just too large to make what was in it feel right or comfortable  i dont know   ill hold final judgement until ive seen it all
Oct 23 2021,positive,amazing adaptation the only mark down was that it felt mainly as a setup for the next film
Oct 23 2021,positive,good effects  excellent adaptation of the book
Oct 23 2021,positive,visually stunning and very faithful adaptation of the first part of the book
Oct 23 2021,positive,amazing a proper adaptation thought to be impossible but nonetheless has been accomplished the movie is worth seeing for the cinematography and music alone the world building is immense and the acting is superb its only downside is that it is a part one there is no climax for this is the prologue for an amazing story hopefully it gets a sequel and more still a masterpiece in every sense of the word
Oct 23 2021,positive,production created another world  really felt the perfectionism of the director and producer cast was great
Oct 23 2021,positive,i knew the movie would be beautiful i knew the actors were top notch but i still didnt expect to be so blown away this movie does omit some explanations about the weirding way or the spacing guild but those are things i agree are best saved for the next movie i have seen it three times now twice in theater once on hbo max it does seem slower than many might expect but it gives moments time to breathe the pacing wasnt slow to me in the second half because we needed to see paul overcome his adversity and choose his path i think its the greatest scifi movie i have seen since the first matrix the star wars a new hope for the next generation wow
Oct 23 2021,positive,loved cant wait for more
Oct 23 2021,positive,they did an amazing job this time story actually follows the book well done 
Oct 23 2021,positive,perfection best experienced on a big screen
Oct 23 2021,positive,well done read the books many times and i think they did a great job bringing one of the best scifi books ever written to life
Oct 23 2021,positive,solid version glad they split into more than one movie a couple things not true to the story but still very well done
Oct 23 2021,positive,as a movie it stands out with a great cast list and amazing visuals its slower paced because it splits the first book into two movies those unfamiliar with the book might have questions so i suggest watching it twice also this needs to be seen in theaters to get the full effect 
Oct 23 2021,positive,see it in imax do bring your ear plugs the music is great  and otherworldly and loud
Oct 23 2021,neutral,im sorry but this was a disappointing movie for me the only thing that kept me from nodding off was the anticipation of seeing jason momoa his character was the only one that gave this film some life the storyline was confusing if you didnt have any background knowledge of the original dune i tried but just couldnt get into the whole storyline 
Oct 23 2021,positive,dune is one of my favorite scifi books and the movie is a perfect rendition visually stunning loved it
Oct 23 2021,positive,wow just wow hands down my favorite version of a filmsmall screen adaptation visually stunning and very well acted at first i was skeptical if timothee calumet as paul at first but 30 minutes in i wassold hands down the most faithful adaptation to the book cannot love this enough 
Oct 23 2021,positive,immense told the book story mostly bit of slow burn definitely felt space was a bit beyond human those unfamiliar with book may benefit from a bit of background like why no robotsai
Oct 23 2021,positive,as a filmmaker i have never been able to answer the question whats your favorite movie and now i finally can dune directed by denis villeneuve is my favorite film of all time there are far too many good things to say about it but do yourself a favor and see it i will be watching it 10 more times this weekendit truly was a masterpiece and i hope they make part 2 soon
Oct 23 2021,positive,loved it cant wait for part 2 chalame may be this generations best actor
Oct 23 2021,positive,excellent movie such an amazing story it could have been even longer a must see
Oct 23 2021,positive,well cast and visually amazing
Oct 23 2021,positive,great movie followed the book didnt leave much out
Oct 23 2021,positive,i was very scared most adaptations have been horrible and i was very pleasantly surprised  it misses some things here and there but over all makes me want to read the books again
Oct 23 2021,positive,very awesome movie beautiful cant wait for part 2 
Oct 23 2021,positive,those who claim eg new yorker review dune includes only stripped down emotion must have either tuned out or lack empathy  in both framing conflict scenes  the are you human test of paul near the beginning and near the end the duel with jamis and its aftermath  the characters express a range of rapidly fluctuating powerful emotions often combined in ways rare in sf mainstream movies and indeed in film generally  in between anyone paying attention would have shared sudden and convincing moments of anger paul at jessica duke at paul ecstatic release shadout mapes when she believes truly perhaps for the first time she is speaking with the mother of a messiah affection leto to paul fear paul seeing horrifying possible futures the baron cowering against the ceiling suppressed anxiety the bravado of the men in the strategy meeting pity for jamis for paul courage duncan liet embarrasment paul and jessica changing into stillsuits remorse paul confronted by luke liet struggling with her conflicts amused scorn chani and a stunned awe chani  in fact the movie improves in minor moments over the books emotional intelligence and does so much to convey emotion that the combination of visual beauty brisk pace and relatively infrequent expositional pauses after the first 15 of setup are likely to leave many of those who have not read the book with a stronger sense of lingering emotional confusion than they can explain  this movie will bear rewatching and the pull towards the sequel is stronger than any plotdriven cliffhanger could have produced  take the negative reviews with at least as much salt as you take exuberant ones like this one
Oct 23 2021,positive,honestlybetter than star wars and lotrcombined
Oct 23 2021,positive,it was pretty i am gay now
Oct 23 2021,positive,amazing and stunning cinematography with a high  attention to detail it felt like i was seeing the book come to life with how accurate the story was
Oct 23 2021,positive,a bit of a confusing storyline especially since i havent seen the original by the end i was invested in the story and looking forward to the second part great visual effects
Oct 23 2021,positive,im a big fan of dune i knew they couldnt do the whole book in one episode so prepare for a sequel i thought it was well worth it
Oct 23 2021,negative,no no no too slow the original had more steam
Oct 23 2021,positive,outstanding visual effects and art design
Oct 23 2021,positive,a science fiction masterpiece
Oct 23 2021,positive,this is such an improvement from past iterations and attempts at translating this book to film in every way from the acting to the epicness of the scenery the sound design the darkness of the harkonnens the only complaints are there wasnt more and the music is not as inspiring as the lynch version  but it definitely leaves you with a desire to see moresooner rather than later and sadly we will have to wait  a fairly decent long time i am sure to be swept up again into the world of arakkis
Oct 23 2021,positive,the audiovisual experience left me on emotional turmoil enjoyed all the character portrayals immensely i have to get this on bluray
Oct 23 2021,positive,its just the beginningof epic
Oct 23 2021,positive,710 couldve shaved 15 minutes off multiple points where it couldve ended reminded me of the epics from the 60s in a good way also mumbling they have subtitles for everything else they could at least provide them when no one can hear what the characters are saying hard to say anyone else couldve handled the material better though still great but looking forward to that sequel for the payoff otherwise unlikely that i would revisit it
Oct 23 2021,positive,amazing hope they make part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,read the book and watched the movie back in 1984 back then i thought both were slow and a bit boring flash forward to 2021 version this movie is also true to the book but with villeneuve style and updated visuals as another reviewer said villeneuves visual style is unmistakable and will remind you of blade runner 2049 for better or for worse all the characters by villeneuves design are so droll and dark like someone just killed their cat i was pleasantly surprised by momoas acting which i thought would be too over the top going into this movie i didnt know it was going to be a 2 parter im sure that will turn a lot of people off because the 2nd movie hasnt been filmed and i just found out hasnt been green lighted yet so there will be a long wait for the next installment now a days people want instant gratification overall this is a good but not great movie if you like world building movie series as i do you will enjoy this go out and read the book this movie has inspired me to reread it 
Oct 23 2021,positive,a fresh and captivating film with an intricately detailed world and definitely worth a watch looking forward to part ii
Oct 23 2021,negative,booorrrrriiiiinnnnggg very slow  confusing
Oct 23 2021,positive,mostly follows the book looks like a trilogy as it only shows the first 3rd of the book  it does move a little on the slow side but its not boring worth watching  would be better if people read the book or did cliff notes to understand how the spice is used by all sects and also how their tech operates
Oct 23 2021,negative,figurine and scenario very beatifull but boring tedious couldent watch until the and
Oct 23 2021,positive,amazing do yourself a favor and watch it
Oct 23 2021,positive,amazing  cinematography excellent soundtrack incredible casting incredible  im on board for all the rest that come  wonderful movie
Oct 23 2021,positive,great scifi flick i liked the slower pace i would say if you like blade runner 2049 you will like this film
Oct 23 2021,positive,after very longtime story movie which is like 5th elements starting imperial style story great personality character  scifi trance music bad guy character like old egypt 300 movie style and awesome movie shot for watching theater
Oct 23 2021,positive,one of the best movies i have ever seen the theatre experience was crazy must see if you like scifi movies
Oct 23 2021,positive,excellent start to finish     leaving myself half a star of room for improvement since i havent seen it in imax yet
Oct 23 2021,neutral,paul atreides and the philosophers spice      welp what a disappointment  while the visuals and sound score for the latest dune movie are gorgeous and grandiose the dialogue and performances are not  all the acting and actors were competent but many of the scenes just lacked emotional depth and power  it was surreal to watch the bland performances and awkwardly reimagined scenes set against majestic backdrops  i see this as a direct result of trying to simplify the source material for mass audiences stripping out the mystery from key elements of the story to make it more accessible  if the previous movie by david lynch failed by being too esoteric then this one by denis villeneuve fails by being too mundane      paul atreides needed to be the backbone of the story as the heir of a planetary duke gifted mentat and inheritor of massive psychic power  instead he comes off as a mildly precocious and occasionally surly teenager  there are attempts to reveal glimpses of his destiny but its pretty clumsy  without having read the books or watched the other movie it might seem like paul is actually a fairly normal boy with a few quirks and a really bad spice hallucination problem  i dont fault the actor for this though as i think it was intentional to make his character more relatable  you can almost think of this version of paul as an every persons harry potter rather than the kwisatz haderach born to set the galaxy on fire    lady jessica appears almost like a normal mother albeit one with a penchant for practicing weird roleplaying with her son and a nervous constitution  shes supposed to be a master practitioner of a myriad of psychological and martial arts  instead she has to haltingly recite the litany against fear just to hold her shit together like some soccer mom out of her depth  in fact without reading the books it might seem like the bene gesserit in general are an organization of mostly normal women who stand out by having powerful political connections  for example their secret and subtle hand signals are reduced to clumsy sign language jessica even uses with normal guards  i found a reference online that called it asl atreides sign language which is both funny and sad    duke leto has a decent performance  he is relatable and projects a competent presence as a warrior leader  but again this comes at the cost of demystifying his character  in the book he was a near prophetic figure  he willingly sacrificed himself for his sons ascension  the first movie understood this and made sure to include a key message he gives to paul without change something sleeps inside us and seldom awakens the sleeper must awaken  here he comes off as largely unaware of the plots within plots around him  they really did him dirty    poor doctor lietkynes got both a race and gender swap  no surprise there with minority inclusion being an important contemporary agenda  in the book liet is a powerful and mysterious character who paved the way for paul and jessica to be accepted by the fremen  he was an important figure and a strong leader but like pauls father he willingly sacrificed himself so that paul might go on to fulfill the prophecy of his people  here liet almost seems afraid to help until forced to when attacked by sardaukar  she then dies by letting a sardaukar literally walk up behind her in the desert just after claiming she was a fremen  it makes the character seem incompetent and unimportant    stilgar chani thufir hawat doctor yueh glossu rabban piter de vries and even the baron harkonnen are all so forgettable that i dont even want to waste the effort delving into what was missing from their current incarnations  to be clear i dont blame the actors as they were clearly being directed and most were barely given any screen time to work with  however choices like this are probably why this movie manages to have less depth than the first one despite being able to focus on only part of the first book    gurney halleck and duncan idaho  what can i say except they steal nearly every scene they are in  in contrast to the other bland performances their characters are so interesting and vital its almost like they are reading from a different version of the movie script  i only wish the other actors were given this level of direction and freedom to breathe life into the movie  then again maybe the director simply couldnt reign in these superstar actors who were willing to play support roles  duncan gets so much screen time and his death scene is so fantastic you might even mistake him for the main character    as for the technology from dune there are some wins here  the shield effects are simple but manage to look pretty decent and are a big improvement over the funny blocks from the first movie  the hard plate armor of the houses and sardaukar are awesome and lend to the quasi medieval vibe of the dune universe  the sardaukar especially make the most of their screen time and go a long way towards showing them off as well equipped elites  by far though the coolest tech presentation is the ornithopter  these machines are freaking amazing and truly inspired with their dragonflyhelicopterbird chassis design and operation  i can see many toy models of these being sold and i might even break down and buy one myself    unfortunately one of the most important pieces of tech comes off as cheap and basic  im referring to the iconic stillsuits  seriously they have parts that are straight off the shelf  paul doesnt wear his boots desert fashion he wears them adidas fashion to sand walk better  also im pretty sure i own a pair of the armored gloves they used  the first movie was much smarter to invest in a fully customized design for the stillsuits recognizing their value in both form and function     at the end of the movie i was reminded of something duke leto said to lietkynes after the ridiculously reimagined sandworm first contact scene  looking back it was truly prophetic    you saw it  with your own eyes  its plain to see  everything theyve left us is in shambles  weve been set up to fail    yes my duke  yes you were
Oct 23 2021,negative,super unfulfilling in that it only covers half the novel
Oct 23 2021,neutral,sound track was stellar cinematography was good the idea of the plot was interesting and intriguing but oh man the it was excruciatingly slow to execute poor contextual clues and overly drawn out set up made for an exhaustive watching experience this coming from a major space scifi fan and aerospace engineer
Oct 23 2021,negative,what a disappointment after all the hype  i loved the first dune 1984 and they didnt have computerized graphics back then   has anyone who thinks this movie is good seen the original  i think its a big failure
Oct 23 2021,positive,epic and grandiose movie
Oct 23 2021,positive,while there are allowances for creative interpretation dune is an epoch right up there with the middle earth works of tolkien and should be respected as such if you are looking for a drive thru single sitting experience this is not it    i will also reflect that producing part one let alone releasing it without a firm comitment to finishing what they started is a sure way to loose whatever momentum is gained this information alone will scare off many since executives in general are very skittish and fickle when it comes to this genre and many of the target audience will refuse to get tricked into another empty promise that will just leave them hanging   tldr if you want real demographics commit to finish what you started then measure the whole anything less with a work like this whis has already proven itself not just feasible but very viable and you are not worthy to work this genere    this said and despite the studios backhanded lack of faith in the writersproducers of this iteration the work has much promise solid casting so far good scenes without the useless filler that has become common place in others works that lack real substance to carry the audience from one moment to the next and just shadowy enough to keep existing franchise viewers wondering with anticipation at what might yet change in this iteration for myself the subtle changes thus far have been spot on with the presented interpretation and i would look forward to a continuation  not sequel be very clear on this distinction if you think sequel here you need to reacquaint yourself with the definitions of the words  though given their tracks in recent years i am not holding my breath for any further works  hope yes i am always hopeful for good scifi and fantasy works   expect no i do not feel the existing studio has the fortitude to keep it going which is artistic malpractice when taking on established epochs like dune  in this case i would gladly be proven wrong but only time will tell
Oct 23 2021,negative,rip off this is part 1 warner bros has not green lighted part two so youre left hanging in the middle of the desert even if they give part two a go itll be at least 3 years to do it i just wasted 22
Oct 23 2021,positive,amazing  not for everyone its story driven so dont expect a superhero type of movie  great performance and amazing story telling with amazing cinematography a must see
Oct 23 2021,positive,45 stars richly imaginative and aided by a brilliant soundtrack and a talented cast best movie since the start of the decade
Oct 23 2021,positive,phenomenal it did the book justice and i cant wait for part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,pretty good  definitely going to get a nod for oscars win for cinematography imo
Oct 23 2021,positive,simply stunning my favorite movie ive seen in theaters ever i cant think of another movie that is more faithfully to its source material while still translating so perfectly to the huge cinematic medium ᑐᑌᑎᕮ
Oct 23 2021,positive,sooooooooooo much better than the original
Oct 23 2021,positive,they got it right they absolutely got it right oh my god i cant wait for more
Oct 23 2021,positive,the visuals and score were really good but thats about it the pacing wasnt that good and the story was just a retread of other popular stories about a young guy being the one this was basically star wars if they never left tatooine
Oct 23 2021,positive,its awesomely wellmade i didnt mind how it ended it felt like a conclusion of sorts   that this film was him turning from a boy to a man  its hugely late19thcentury in its colonial and imperial themes design and structure  its huge longue usr its hypnotic power like watching a debussy or wagner opera designed by adolphe appia  and as such it wont be for everyone chalamet glues it together with the assurance of a born leading man the king was a great trialrun for this  rebecca ferguson amazing as his mother and was that just a whiff of incest in the air along with the spice towards the end momoa isaacs brolin rampling skarsgård bautista zendaya mckinley duncanbrewster bardem all doing great work villeneuve is a forwardlooking artist who knows his history and doesnt mind telling a story slowly like i say this isnt going to be for everyone
Oct 23 2021,positive,cinematography was excellent and i loved how the script followed the book so closely
Oct 23 2021,positive,excellent beginning to a great story
Oct 23 2021,positive,dune is absolutely astonishing in everything story soundtrack and visuals are so immersive 2h35min that flew away i want part 2 as soon as possible warner bros please make it happen
Oct 23 2021,positive,amazing the breadth of story that dennis and the team accomplished is staggering as a life long fan im very happy and look forward to the second instalment
Oct 23 2021,negative,visually stunning well acted however a blaring score and excellent cgi can not compensate for a mind numbingly boring movie the pace is plodding and uneven to the point where when something interesting finally happens my mind and body cannot react as they have disengaged from the movie two hours felt like four i will not be seeing this again unless i have an intractable case of insomnia that needs rectifying
Oct 23 2021,positive,it was a great update to the past movie
Oct 23 2021,positive,the movie was absolutely great fantastic visuals vfx are top i enjoyed every minute of it and i want more looking forward to chapter 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,it followed the book quite closely glad it will be in several parts great movie  sound filming special effects
Oct 23 2021,positive,see it in the theatre if you read the books you wont be disappointed great job with the details
Oct 23 2021,positive,the movie is very well done the effects described in the book are hard to pull off in a believable way and the director nails it its part one of two so dont expect conclusion and i highly recommend reading the book before hand all the actors were picked well for the roles best seen in theatre for the first time loved it
Oct 23 2021,positive,all around great entertainment  better than its predecessors  hope they do part 2 for the second half of the book
Oct 23 2021,positive,beautifully shot and composed
Oct 23 2021,negative,the only positive is that i saw this garbage for free on hbo max the performances are subpar with the exception of javier barden jason momoa plays khal drogo again you know the same character he played in aquaman the picture is way too dark at times  supposedly to be realistic but in reality makes portions of the movie unwatchable they covered less in almost two and a half slow passing hours than the original this is only the beginning yes the beginning of a failed attempt to restart a franchise that didnt catch on the first time utter trash
Oct 23 2021,positive,great movie cant wait for the next chapter
Oct 23 2021,positive,best scifi movie of this century
Oct 23 2021,negative,booooring visual effects and the cast 100 25 hours of nothing
Oct 23 2021,positive,loved the lead actor  some familiar faces were great  storyline was a little hard to follow there wasnt enough action the scenes were very dark lighting and hard to see sometimes and i felt the whole movie was very monotone in color and tone and dragged on way too long  good not great didnt live up to the hype imo  b grade
Oct 23 2021,positive,i liked the movie it was spectacular and cozy the sound effects are fantastic i look forward to the sequel
Oct 23 2021,positive,striking visuals but moves slow at times i hate to say jt but i still think i like the original movie better both had star studded casts i think the original movie made better use of its cast
Oct 23 2021,positive,this movie is a masterpiece im so glad they took their time with this one and didnt rush the all story into just one movie the visuals casting outfits soundtracks and story were all amazing seeing it in a cinema was definitly the best option breathtaking i really want to see a part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,this is an absolutely visually stunning movie that needs to be seen on the big screen at least once the acting and direction are excellent and the writing is true to the novel i look forward to the other movies in what is apparently planned as a trilogy
Oct 23 2021,positive,i am having a hard time remembering the last time i saw a film that was as beautiful as dune the cinematography is outstanding the scope is completely alien as if your no longer on the planet earth everything is massive and imposing and so beautifully realistic the whole movie had this ethereal feel to it that is hard to describe with words
Oct 23 2021,positive,awesome movie that is meant to be seen on the big screen the only thing is that it is not a complete story we need part 2 to get made go see it in theaters in imax if you can
Oct 23 2021,positive,first and foremost lets get the obvious out of the way  dune is not by any stretch of the imagination the easiest material to make into a movieperiod as a person who has   1 as a child read dune and children of dune  2 grew up on the 1984 de laurentis version of dune  3 enjoyed the multidvd scifi channel miniseries of dune  what denis villeneuve has pulled off in my opinion is nothing short of breathtaking   the visuals were amazing and which is the most important in any movie or television show casting was absolutely spot on i was far more immersed that ive ever been and the general setting gave me chills i was blown away and speaking as someone who knows more of this story than the average person thats saying something
Oct 23 2021,positive,loved the movie cinematography and costumes loved everything except for how loud the music was compared to the words the acting was a little hollow too
Oct 23 2021,negative,dune is a grab by villeneuve and his production gang for a huge chunk of continued profits   more of a marketing ploy than the desire to tell a great story this movie was a visually stunning two and a half hour trailer for its sequel an artistic way to approach marketing of a franchise in reference to the story i felt like i was being fed breadcrumbs and that this was and is the plan  a way to squeeze as many movies out of herberts book as possible a beautiful but utter disappointment and most probably what can be expected of however many movies this franchise has in store for its audiences i wont be counted among them
Oct 23 2021,negative,any movie that makes me fall asleep is automatically 1 star was an hour too long
Oct 23 2021,positive,the only disappointment was not the sequel coming out next year this must be watched in imax and hbo max for rewatch
Oct 23 2021,positive,incredible as good of an adaptation as you could make fans of the book will love it
Oct 23 2021,positive,true to the book mostly amazing cinematography the time flew by cant wait to part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,the superlatives have already been said by others so ill just repeat in one word  great its the best visual adaptation so far hopefully the american audience has not become so dumbeddown that it cant appreciate the grim allusions to the current day thats what the best scifi has sadly lacking in blockbuster eyecandy like star wars marvel universe etc
Oct 23 2021,positive,cant wait for part ii
Oct 23 2021,positive,it was a well done adaptation of a difficult book to film
Oct 23 2021,positive,the visuals story soundtrackeverything the actors were amazing this movie made me go buy the book loved it
Oct 23 2021,positive,the film is visually beautiful and the way denis shows the multiple planets is incredible the score by hans zimmer added another layer however the action fell way short and if you arent someone who normally likes out of the box sci fi movies youre gonna hate it
Oct 23 2021,positive,amazing must watch in theaters
Oct 23 2021,positive,this is the first time in a long time ive walked away from the cinema happy with what ive just seen im quite a critical person by nature but i cannot find fault with this film    firstly the visuals and music in this are incredible every shot looks beautiful and this sound track is on another level  its worth seeing just for those two aspects but i was really impressed by the cast and their performances the world building and pacing was great it really introduces you to the universe well and kept my attention the entire film i didnt cringe or think anything was cheesy either this is just a good story told well    i will say at this point the 2 guys that came with me were not as impressed as me they were confused by the plot and the amount of information the film throws at you  but they still thoroughly enjoyed it     i would actually suggest seeing this in a cinema not on just a normal tv to really experience the music and the atmosphere  similar to 1917     cant wait for part 2
Oct 23 2021,negative,so disappointing boring struggled to watch he whole  eventually gave up    i had so much hope for thisas so many good actors but writing so badacting worse    the series was so much betteracted and written    if i could i would give it a lower rating
Oct 23 2021,negative,so boring if you have never read the book then this movie makes no sense its as if the screenwriterauthor was high on  drugs while  writing the story
Oct 23 2021,positive,generally solid expression of the novel but horrific casting of zendaya and occasional uneven direction from villeneuve  had the potential to be better
Oct 23 2021,negative,boring then and boring now
Oct 23 2021,positive,dune manages to distill down almost everything essential needed for an amazing cinema experience with its immersive soundtrack score  lush surreal imagery  above average performances and its devotion to the dune source essence   you feel as though you were transported  as a moviegoer you can ask for no better experience in my opinion  of course there are those who will not walk away with as favorable an opinion which will ultimately come down to its flaws in story building  these flaws are surely noticeable but if your someone who appreciates both the  big cinema experience  and scifi then this almost instantly forgiven  in fact this movie accomplishes something somewhat transcendent that im not  sure ive ever experienced what i believe this remake has done is  to take the essence of the original and make the unusualness of the material palatable  the original flaw in the original dune is in fact its lack of compelling storytelling  its not that the story isnt compelling its the act and art form of storytelling is absent  which is no fault of the new creators  we all naturally love to be seduced by storyline and this a flaw in dune  and after experiencing dune you cant help but feel like you just dreamt this unimaginably surreal and bizarre dream of a future world thats steeped in harsh unforgiving truth  that you awake from and are instantly hit with a deep yearning to know more  unfortunately a perfect movie experience would have built that yearning slowly and satisfied it  something even a part two cant go back and fix  perhaps mr  villenavue should have created his own world and told us a new story  because i would love to get lost in it 
Oct 23 2021,positive,ever so slightly too long
Oct 23 2021,positive,this movie is amazing the story is good the casting is great and the visuals are just amazing
Oct 23 2021,positive,much more detailed than original movie but in a very good way view this one as an origin movie that is laying the groundwork  part 2 will be incredible
Oct 23 2021,positive,this remake of the 1984 scifi epic is one of the most visually stunning and breathtaking movies of 2021 the vast landscapes and enticing backstory of arrakiss native population is the main attention grabber of the movie as there are many parts that do drag out about 34 of the way through the movie you start to check the time and realize its a 3 hour movie
Oct 23 2021,positive,absolutely amazing visuals are insane
Oct 23 2021,positive,denis finally did ita dune adaption well part 1 anyway thats as faithful to the book as you can probably get by translating a book into film this is a gorgeous movie that dune fans will love and is accessible to people not familiar to dune im optimistic we will get part 2 god i hope so
Oct 23 2021,positive,i enjoyed the movie a bit of a dark dystopian world a little reckless to end where it did and to not have the sequel filmed i hope they pull off the sequel but who knows how long that will take
Oct 23 2021,positive,amazing special effects  cant wait to see part 2  i remember the original dune and was amazed by that version as well  good cast  i was wowd the entire movie
Oct 23 2021,positive,found it very interesting  was totally into it even my friend who is not a scifi fan was into it by the 2nd half  now wants part 2 out now  the beginning is slow but the back story is necessary
Oct 23 2021,positive,masterful adaptation that will awe even those who are not yet dune fans
Oct 23 2021,positive,it was really long but really good
Oct 23 2021,negative,huge disappointment nothing like the book
Oct 23 2021,positive,wow this was such a captivating movie even after 25hrs i could bing and sit for part 2 if its available all the characters were well developed and amazingly well acted i cannot believe dune was not made into movies or tv series since 1984   im looking into the book series while i wait for part 2 movie to come out please be soon
Oct 23 2021,positive,breathtaking been twice
Oct 23 2021,positive,loved the movie visual effects battle scenes have me chilled the story easier to follow than previous attempts  total immersive experience in my opinion 
Oct 23 2021,positive,though this adaptation of dune is closer to the source material there are still some notable differences from the book to movie adaptation that being said dennis villanueva has done an incredible job at bringing this piece of work to life an all star cast combined with epic music and striking visuals make this movie a standalone success and a must see in theaters on the big screen or in imax as intended hopefully the success of this film will green light the part two and we get to see the conclusion of dune
Oct 23 2021,positive,great movie best one yet
Oct 23 2021,positive,this visually stunning film based on frank herberts 1965 novel is an epic and enthralling masterpiece the movie is also very long but is entertaining enough to keep you completely engaged with an all star cast great story telling and characters stunning effects and action this movie is perfect for fans of the novel or people new to dune
Oct 23 2021,positive,most beautiful movie ive seen in a while accompanied by some of the greatest music i could ask for this movie though serves purely to setup for the next movie nuts to buts action throughout the movie but by the end you realize that it wont actually mean anything until you see part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,better than expected im a huge dune fan and this movie was the best adaptation i could have expected really looking forward to the next installments
Oct 23 2021,positive,i wanted to be in this universe the minute i saw the trailer it did not disappoint the pacing characters music environments everything in this movie invites you into the lore the bad guys are not just evil but they are absolutely disgusting and terrifying such an amazing movie probably the best scifi movie ive seen in a long time
Oct 23 2021,positive,makes the original movie look like the storyboard for the remake perfectly done best movie since arrival
Oct 23 2021,positive,see this movie on the biggest screen you can
Oct 23 2021,positive,this is a well adapted film version of the first half of the book denis villeneuve has done frank herberts masterpiece justice i have seen it twiceonce at a screening a week before release which featured a fire side chat with denis as well as on opening day at the earliest possible matinee it is a rich and and gripping film and has depth that can be appreciated from multiple viewings denis has set the bar high bar for part two
Oct 23 2021,positive,i think this was a great adaptation the only complaint is hopes that they make some audio improvements in the sequel although that could have just been my theater
Oct 23 2021,negative,long boring and confusing
Oct 23 2021,positive,its an entrancing experience of sounds and visuals dune is extremely immersive makes you feel as if you are spying on the characters no one in the cinema dares to eat their popcorn use their phone or go to the bathroom once the credits start rolling you feel incapable of getting up from your seat you wish you could continue the experience its the type of movie which you cant discuss after exiting the cinema it leaves you speechless
Oct 23 2021,positive,great acting and cinamotography
Oct 23 2021,positive,signed up for rotten tomatoes just to leave this review i loved it so much visually incredible great performances and this amazing world is fully realized it feels old and lived in and full of history
Oct 23 2021,positive,this is the best movie i have seen in years its incredible i was so worried they would butcher it but that director knows what hes doing arrival blade runner 2049  prisoners sicario denis villeneuve knows what hes doing the movie is alien and ancient and as unfriendly as the planet the moviebook is based on  people complaining about the plot being confusing are the people that want their movies spoon fed to them this movie makes you pay attention and immerses you into something beautiful and alien  i hope to god we get enough people in theaters because part 2 needs to be made  this is the star wars lord of the rings of this generation get off the couch and see this masterpiece in imax then rewatch it on hbomax  you wont regret it some people will inevitably hate it but for the rest it will be one of the most unforgettable experiences in theaters youll ever have
Oct 23 2021,positive,i suspect this movie will fall into the some people love it and other people hate it category    as someone who only recently read the dune books for the first time i thought the movie was visually spectacular audacious and very true to the spirit of the books  during the movie i was trying to think of another movie that was as stunning from a visual perspective in terms of inventing a whole new world  the original blade runner jumped out to me  i also thought of the star wars movies and all of the worlds and creatures they created but this was so much more than that the movie is stunning and every single scene has so much detail to it  if this doesnt win basically every academy award for visual effectscostumesdesign etc i will be surprised    there were little details from the book that i loved how they handled  for example they really did a great job of explaining and then showing the voice  and also i loved the depiction of the atreides hand communication    but i could also see how someone who had not read the books would feel confused and overwhelmed and ultimately disappointed  this is very much a part i  there is no satisfying ending and you really did just stop the movie in the middle  there is also a lot going on to try to understand i could definitely see people walking away thinking what the heck was that    but overall i really enjoyed it and definitely hope they make part ii
Oct 23 2021,negative,didnt like the movie
Oct 23 2021,positive,visually appealing incredible score perfect cast this movie was awesome i cant wait for the parts to follow
Oct 23 2021,positive,this movie is a masterpiece loved every second great acting and an epic adventure cant wait for the sequel
Oct 23 2021,positive,dune is one of my favorite books if not my favorite it hurts me to say this its physically difficult the movie was better than the book looking forward to part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,i dont really do reviews here seeing as its critic review is worthless i havent liked most movies that have come out and the last movie i saw in theaters was alita battle angel i went to see this and absolutely enjoyed this masterpiece  as a fan of the book of course i appreciated the attention to detail that this movie embodied go see it for yourself because it deserves to be seen in a theater
Oct 23 2021,positive,i had very high expectations of this movie i find it a bit slow but its not a bad movie
Oct 23 2021,positive,fans of the book will love the way this movie captures the look sound and feel of the original story or at least the first half of that story although this is called dune its made clear early in the film that its just part i of what i assume will be a twopart series given this movies abrupt ending and lack of any real conclusion people who are not already fans of the book might wonder what all the fuss is about they might want to wait for part ii to be available before watching part i or even better read the book its great
Oct 23 2021,positive,if you havent read the books you wont understand anything this movies did a horrible job of telling g the story its visually appealing but has little to none of the narrative to back it up literally the worst storytelling job ever
Oct 23 2021,positive,groundbreaking music and sound amazing photography and effects excellent plot line and surprisingly good acting see it on a giant screen
Oct 23 2021,negative,i gave up after 48 minutes because i was so unbelievably bored the pacing of this thing is atrocious
Oct 23 2021,positive,very impactful and visual making of dune delivers a lot of the fantastical scale and beauty of the world of dune excited to see a directors cut to do deeper exploration of the world and to see the sequel and how they land the majestic new dune epic they have just launched
Oct 23 2021,positive,the best dune yet  cant wait for part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,masterpiece really fills in the gaps where the book  is slightly confusing     ignore the skeptics and go see this movie
Oct 23 2021,positive,i went into this movie knowing nothing about this franchise really besides the   books are absolutely adored by scifi fans all over also went into this with hbomax which didnt really hinder the viewing experience what so ever it starts quickly and over time youre met with useful or even confusing information the writing was exceptional some dialogue felt like it was feeding directly into certain tropes but with the context that this is a remake of an 80s film some moments like these are bound to happen thankfully for me it wasnt super awesome the editing was also amazing but there are a few weird cuts it didnt ruin any moments for me but it did make me take a mental note of it because to me at least it was that obvious    visually this movie is 1010 from the cgi to the fight choreography to the costume design dave bautista looked truly scary in this movie thats another thing movies these days have the issue of casting famous people and letting that be a crutch marvel movies often feel like ah yes chris pratt is starlord instead of making the connection with the character thats deserved to respect its growth and decisions more like how you watch aquaman and youre like yup thats jason momoa instead of thinking about arthur in dune i didnt have that disconnect each character truly had me going through it     while it ended strong and just kept that same pace it did end pretty abruptly i literally said what the fuck out loud and got a little visibly upset that after 2 and a half hours it wouldve ended with a better conclusion sets it up perfectly for a second movie and it doesnt have much else going for it this  movie will set the bar for filmmaking for years to come much like bladerunner 2049 its just so insanely beautiful found myself saying that out loud quite often     this is my favorite movie this year i wish i could give it 5 stars but that ending is jarring i have more questions than answers time to read the books goodbye now
Oct 23 2021,positive,i have been waiting on this movie for a while definitely didnt disappoint had good cinematography enough action to keep you engaged and it left you wanting more
Oct 23 2021,positive,had no clue this was a 2 part movie going in so that left me feeling unsatisfied  its hard to like this movie if you loved the original  only the visualization effects made it worth seeing  im not happy about having have to pay more to see the end
Oct 23 2021,positive,they nailed it the characters the foreshadowing the pace 100 best movie in years
Oct 23 2021,positive,that was the best movie experience i have had this year superb
Oct 23 2021,positive,an absolutely beautiful stunning movie a great beginning to what is sure to be an epic telling of frank herberts amazing books
Oct 23 2021,negative,outfits and sets are beautiful but from the book to this movie really not captivating music is slow dialogue is slow glad i streamed it would have definitely fallen asleep  the movie theater  zendaya kept it beautiful at the end
Oct 23 2021,positive,meh it passed the time is about right the cinematography was great the acting was great but the story was very drawn out and had just enough going on to keep you from walking away me my wife and two kids 25 17 all watched together and our collective review is a 710 just meh
Oct 23 2021,positive,one of the few movies that lives up to the hype just a great movie with some great acting and stunning visuals i didnt read the books but it was fairly easy to understand the plot and most of the subplots i applaud the directorproducerswriters and everyone else involved in this movie
Oct 23 2021,positive,was very well written nice music nice staging 
Oct 23 2021,positive,dune 2021  overall amazing well done on all fronts see this movie in the theater   fans of frank herberts dune series have been waiting a lifetime for a movie adaptation faithful enough to the books but grandiose enough for the big screen to emerge and i think its safe to say the wait is over this is the version that strikes upon all the necessary elements to satisfy not just dune fans but the average moviegoer as well     the cast is a whos who of celebrity alisters oscar isaac rebecca ferguson josh brolin jason momoa stellan skarsgard javier bardem and many others obviously wed expect a lot from them and they dont disappoint oscar gives a very nuanced performance as he encourages paul to find his path and lead a doomed house from their safehaven homeworld into battle stellans acting is brandoesque and relies more heavily on visual cues but he exudes villainy as the grotesque plundering baron even momoa who typically has a narrow emotional range and is a less obvious casting choice than his predecessors is less perfunctory in his role as house swordsmaster and guardian to paul i have to admit i was not entirely excited to see him take that role on but he manages to pull it off and we even get a few laughs in from him despite the apprehensive atmosphere of the rest of the movie  sharon duncanbrewster is an odd gender swap for liet kynes the imperial ecologist  planetologist but refreshingly sells us on her performance i wish chang chen as the traitorous dr yueh would have gotten more screen time but with an ensemble this large there have to be some tradeoffs     as for newcomers timothee chalamet and zendaya as paul atreides and chani they lend enough gravitas into their roles to drive home the desperation of their situations but leave just enough teenage innocence on the table to make believable the emotional heartbreak of the vicious decision they must make to survive before the end of the movie for chanis character maybe this is simple math the way of the desert and zendaya handles it aptly timothee struggles a little bit in that final jarring scene which probably should have been edited more succinctly so probably not his fault but all in all his performance absolutely shines as he drives subtle changes from being a superfluous courtly adolescent to forging his way through to the door of manhood     the look and sound of the film is gorgeous which is something weve come to expect from denis villeneuve and hans zimmer and is exactly the reason why you should take the time to see this in the theater the first time you see the sprawling and endless waves of desert sand you get a sense of how big this movie is and should be the familiar beating of the ornithopter aircraft wings does justice to herberts descriptions in the book and is something that must be felt in the vibrations of the theater the roar of the worm is amazingly believable and the sonorous blasts that underscore the tension and drives scene changes is very effective dont be surprised in the least if this movie racks up quite a few awards for technical achievements     despite running a touch over two and a half hours the movie paces quite well we get to linger on the striking landscapes and long shots just enough between scenes so that the film never feels rushed and allows you time to breathe and revel in the underlying moods some scenes from the book were omitted and maybe could have warranted better exposition but villeneuve modifies the script just enough to be faithful to herberts vision while moving the action forward adroitly     if you like frank herberts series youll enjoy this movie and even if you dont know the first thing about the series you will still enjoy this movie for what it is and maybe delve further in either way youre going to have fun well done all  we look forward to seeing you in the next installment
Oct 23 2021,positive,i was really surprised by this movie i did not think i would like it and i didnt i loved it great visuals good telling of the book just worth a watch
Oct 23 2021,positive,amazing  best movie i have seen in the past 10 years better than the last 3 star wars movies combined  great action plot and graphics  i could have stayed for another 2 hours  sure hope we dont have to wait long to see part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,the best dune movie to date cant wait for part 2 3 and more
Oct 23 2021,positive,very long movie it was hard to follow at times
Oct 23 2021,negative,the movie was interesting but incredibly slow by the end i felt myself begging for it to end because the final scene dragged on forever if youve read the books youll like it more
Oct 23 2021,positive,beautiful epic depiction of the book
Oct 23 2021,positive,beautifully done and several times had me on the edge of my seat visually stunning the costuming and sets are incredible most of the casting choices feel right and overall it is a great film adaptation of the book let it stand on its own and enjoy it as an artistic interpretation if we could have binged part two immediately we would have cant wait for the next one to be released my husband and i are huge scifi fans and this is now one of our top 5 favorites dont miss it
Oct 23 2021,positive,a cinematic masterpiece just one thing make sure you watch it in a theater with comfy seats we saw it in imax but the seats were traditional folddown seats for a 25 hour movie i was miserably uncomfortable definitely watch it in imax with recliner seats and youll enjoy it
Oct 23 2021,positive,the perfect entry to the franchise left me wanting more and part 2 cant come out soon enough greenlight it a wonderful balance of audio visual and performances 
Oct 23 2021,positive,i cant usually sit through 25 hour movie and not get bored but this one flew by in a flash it was utterly immersive and visually stunning cinematography and costumes and sets were awesome im seeing some people call it slow but the slow parts are not boring they are engrossing and beautiful and planned to be just the pace they are not only did they do an amazing job of adapting the story they incorporated tons of awesome small details reminiscent of both the book and the first film the acting is great chalamet was born for this role watching it in the theater would have been even better i saw it at home really hoping they green light the next films
Oct 23 2021,positive,true to herberts storyline nicely paced great castingcinematography
Oct 23 2021,positive,really enjoyed the plot and suspense  similar to star wars and yet different enough to be intriguing    the movie seemed to move slow at a few places
Oct 23 2021,positive,the film is predominantly really well cast and nails the ethereal epic tone of the novel which i read in preparation for this film
Oct 23 2021,positive,literally the best experience ive had in the imax since interstellar
Oct 23 2021,positive,looked beautiful awesome props true to the books excellent acting good story
Oct 23 2021,positive,amazing movie this movie takes its time and is accurate to the book the visual are incredible and the soundtrack is phenomenal i would recommend it to everyone
Oct 23 2021,positive,sit back and let this audiovisual masterpiece flow over and stimulate all your senses
Oct 23 2021,positive,everything i was hoping for i hope it makes enough to greenlight part 2 because im stoked for the rest
Oct 23 2021,positive,a very immersive sound and visual wonder i loved every second of the movie and wanted more it is a bit slow and a bit contemplative but the second part is worth waiting for do not forget that this adaptation only includes the first half of the book the cast  exceptional each and every one of them
Oct 23 2021,positive,this version of dune really captures the tone and feel of the novel which i highly recommend the direction art direction acting wardrobe and special effects are top notch i hope this becomes a successful franchise
Oct 23 2021,positive,overall it is a very good movie but lacks the emotional connection with the characters i didnt feel emotionally invested in any of the characters as i did with previous versions of this franchise also there are grand sweeping shots of landscape that are gorgeous but feel a bit pointless i feel the overall run time of this movie could have been cut down by at least 30 to 60 minutes and would have been much better  this would have added to the tension suspense and intrigue of the film leading into the next one
Oct 23 2021,positive,loved the visuals casting handling of the storyline and the overall feel that kept close the the original film version great movie this is only part 1 so i understand why it ended   in this way
Oct 23 2021,positive,it was a good movie but the story line was confusing in the the first hour of theove and the dreams of the main characters were not in order of the story but in the end it was a good movie
Oct 23 2021,positive,i loved it  cant wait for the next one
Oct 23 2021,positive,had potential to be in line with avatar and certain star wars films for some reason the character development and slow pacing held it back
Oct 23 2021,positive,borderline perfect filmmaking and pacing the efficiently in which the film gets you understanding its universe and characters is impressive i was immediately submerged and invested cannot wait for more
Oct 23 2021,positive,great show effects acting story  everything was great
Oct 23 2021,positive,very well made cant wait for second part
Oct 23 2021,negative,i am a huge fan of the book and the 1984 movie i felt like the movie rushed to get paul and jessica to the desert and glossed over some of the best dune lines as well as the barons craziness cinematography was excellent as was all the digital features but overall disappointed
Oct 23 2021,positive,especially in a theater this is such an immersive experience of sound and visuals see it in a theater beyond that its got a ton of great action and thrilling sequences and its a real blast i think all the actors did a great job especially oscar isaac and charlotte rampling i read the book so i wasnt confused at all and everyone i know understood it fine without reading the book but i cant say for certain that every newcomer will feel the same
Oct 23 2021,positive,i dont say this easilythis is one of the best movies ive ever seen  the visuals the music the story absolutely incredible  they better make a part 2 because i cant handle not finishing this epic story
Oct 23 2021,positive,i can say with absolute certainty that i am completely enamoured with this movie and cannot get it out of my mind it is everything i could have ever dreamed it to be    as an adaptation it focuses on streaming the story to make it easier for the audience to follow  but never sacrificing what makes it dune the political games are there the issues of messianic worship and manipulated faiths the brutality of nature the exploitation of people and lands and at its core a story of a young boy trying to find his place in this foreign world    the entire cast is just fantastic oscar isaac is the most dilf hes ever been jason momoa is a blast and sharon duncanbrewster is astounding but special call outs to timothée chalamet  rebecca ferguson timothée does a just fantastic job of portraying the internal struggle of paul his worries of his place in the universe and his fears when he is shown a possible future he displays such a maturity but also the underlying darkness that defines who paul atreides is   out of the entire cast if anybody is to get awards recognition it will be rebecca ferguson she delivers a powerful performance of a woman divided between her love for her son her passion for her lover and her duty to her sisterhood she has this intensive vulnerability but finds a strength in it she is a perfect jessica and he is the perfect paul    on every single technical level this film is an absolute cinematic achievement the scope and scale of everything is just so gargantuan and dwarfs everything in comparison seeing this in imax should almost be required if you are vaccinated and feel safe enough because god damn does it create just an entire different experience the massive screen allows for the full breadth and range of the worlds their machines and the harsh environments   the sound design and mixing completely immersed  you the way the voice is portrayed is bone chilling the precognition and psychedelic whispers are haunting hans zimmer creates another iconic and defining score   this goes to show how when you have passionate creatives and workers you can create a spectacle like never before this should be part of the definition and standard for blockbusters going forward    i cannot wait to rewatch this film take it in fall in love with it and then go see dune part two when it comes out it will be the defining scifi saga for a generation and im so happy i get to be apart of that
Oct 23 2021,positive,ive read dune 10 times and this movie was a great adaptation cant wait for part 2 great casting 
Oct 23 2021,positive,a great depiction of a great book acceptable liberties taken with little things from the book relies heavily on show dont tell filmmaking if there was one movie ment to be seen on the big screen this would be the movie to see on the biggest screen possible
Oct 23 2021,positive,finally a movie that honors the books gravitas
Oct 23 2021,negative,absolutely stunned that this is rated over 80 by critics and 90 by customers lol ill overlook it was super slow which is to be expected but the acting was awful the script was awful ofcourse limited by the novel the idea is to bring in new fans which you wont the visuals was the only thing good here
Oct 23 2021,positive,even though the movie experience mightve been a bit slower and not as entertaining it sets up an amazing world for the other movies in the series the movie was insanely cinematic and had breathtaking shots the entire movie was out together absolutely amazingly and im anticipating the release of part 2 because i feel like it will continue on the insane filmography of the first film
Oct 23 2021,positive,plenty of action  cant wait for the sequel
Oct 23 2021,positive,simply awesome and a breath of fresh air compared to a lot of the trash scifi  action movies that have been released lately best movie ive seen in a while and cant wait for the next one
Oct 23 2021,negative,i have not submitted a review here in some time but i feel compelled to after watching this movie dune essentially is a 2 12 hour product of some egocentric director given free reign to crap out a movie it is the most pretentious nonsensical movie i have ever seen in my life its as if the director tossed out plot in favor of trying to impress an audience with his grand sweeping visuals there is no story here it is 150 minute slog the dialogue is downright awful and eye rolling the acting is wooden the lead character timothee chamelet or however you spell his name is flat throughout the entire movie and has the charisma of a brick he should instead stick to wearing fancy clothes and playing dress up at the met gala i could go into other issues with this movie apparently its really hot in the desert and people cant be outside for very long but of course we see timothee in his black tom ford suit strutting around the desert in mid day like hes on some fashion runway please avoid this movie and do your best to not watch it it appears they are setting up a sequel and it would be terrible to reward this terrible director with another chance to stroke his ego
Oct 23 2021,positive,beautifully filmed movie slow pacing and a number of holes for those who are not familiar with the original story
Oct 23 2021,positive,wonderfully shot visual joy astounding soundtrack cant wait for bluray  a tad long but necessary considering the source material i was surprised the chose to end it where they did
Oct 23 2021,positive,liked that it followed the book more closely disliked that it went only 13 of the way through parts ii and iii better be as good or better
Oct 23 2021,negative,not really a complete movie 2hrs of set up for a sequel to come years later waste of time
Oct 23 2021,positive,it was too long not particularly clear story line
Oct 23 2021,positive,great movie  only drawback was toooooo much zendeya footage shes not that much of a major character  she gets way too much coverage
Oct 23 2021,positive,grand masterful aweinspiring
Oct 23 2021,positive,loved the film everything about the world and the characters is so interesting if we dont get a part 2 ill be devastated 
Oct 23 2021,positive,phenomenal majestic stunning stays very true to the source material 
Oct 23 2021,positive,the pacing may have been a little slow but it definitely makes sense for the movie itself especially knowing its part of a series the cinematography is spectacular and the storyline is engaging
Oct 23 2021,positive,ive read the book a couple of times and ive seen the 1980s film versions several times  i think they did a great job making this feel like the epic that the book is and taking a very dense novel and making it much more coherent than 1980s film did  the acting for the most part was well done not 100 sold on the actor playing paul but i think he did reasonably well  the choices of jason mamoa for dincan  james brolin for gurney were great  they did gender swap one character but as a rule of thumb i try not to criticize those decisions until i see it and i think she did just fine  the effects were very well done as was the sound  i definitely recommend seeing it in theaters first if possible i have a good home setup but its not the same
Oct 23 2021,positive,dune was very enjoyable  looking forward to part 2 engaging story  beautifully shot rebecca ferguson as lady jessica was the real stand out actor timothee chalament in the lead paul was very good in a difficult role there wasnt one bad performance it was long  over 25 hours and towards the end it did feel long as my wife jo remarked there was enough action for me in it and neither of us found it boring my one grouse was the cutting of some very important dialogue from the soothsayer lady with the veil in the trailer we heard her say more and it made clear what paul was all about and what was to come very puzzled why it was removed lost the star because it it messed up the plot and pauls role highly recommended if you dont mind character building and actually listening instead of battles and loud music almost nonstop raging around you  jo co
Oct 23 2021,positive,wheres the rest of the story
Oct 23 2021,positive,absolutely gorgeous performances lived up to the storytelling to deliver an adaptation that was everything that i dreamed it could be
Oct 23 2021,positive,an absolutely amazing film  everything about this is incredible and epic  the acting filmography graphics choreography soundtrack absolutely everything  cannot recommend enough and cant wait for part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,great cinematic experience  visuals were amazing and the music and acting were very good  a little slow at times but i believe they are just getting the story going for the second installment which should be a little faster paced  all in all loved the story and cant wait for the second film
Oct 23 2021,positive,first ive got to say that dune was a very great and magnificent experience in imax this is the first time to feel hyped for a book based movie since harry potter and honestly wb made a big campaign for the movie that i like and respect lets talk about positives and negatives    positives    the visuals are great    the acting was superb especially chalamet and ferguson    the score suited the movie in a good way    the film itself isnt boring although its long    the story is great    villenuve handled the visions sequences in a good way    action scenes were enormous    villeneuve takes his time to build the world and characters an advantage to those who never read the book and disadvantage to those who read    although they had little screen time momoa brolin bautista duncanbrewester nailed their roles i honestly cant imagine anyone playing these roles but them    the fremen are presented as powerful religious  yet dangerous    i like how villeneuve showed how hot sandy and dangerous arrakis is    worms are perfect      negatives  although ive written that the story was good but it missed many aspects that  couldve made it quite better and thats a many based on a novel movies problem    a lot of story is left out from the movie but you wont get lost in the movie    but honestly these negative points doesnt affect the movie that much    overall comparing to the og dune villenuves dune is quite spectacular and it deserves a 9510 i recommend everyone to see it in imax because believe me its liks nothing youve seen before
Oct 23 2021,positive,id give dune a b i enjoyed it and i would say it was 7580 on par with the book some politically correct changes liet kynes as a black female diversity in the desert but as far wokeness destroying a movie it didnt destroy this one just minor irritations i like most of the main characters but jessica was too weepy for me paul was good leto was good and i even liked the baron raban was also played well as was stilgar and chani gurney and duncan were perfectly cast and acted     sadly im going to go on record as saying that it wont be a huge success i hope i am wrong but i think fans of scifi will enjoy it the average person is going to yawn and think its far too long also its only a half movie it ends halfway through the book    ill be watching it again on hbo max at some point since the first halfhour of the movie was blurry due to projection issues and i had to go complain three times before something was done plus one bathroom break because it was 2 hr 35 min at home i can watch it much more indepth but again i did enjoy it today and im grateful it wasnt peter jacksoned
Oct 23 2021,positive,followed the book didnt mess around with stuff too much great sound design and visuals
Oct 23 2021,positive,outstanding adaptation probably the best so far cant wait until the next installment hoping theres enough traction to expand the universe to the subsequent books of the franchise
Oct 23 2021,positive,thoroughly enjoyable but wonder how it is for anyone who never read any of the books
Oct 23 2021,neutral,the sorry line was amazing but the movie itself was terribly slow
Oct 23 2021,positive,if you didnt read the book you will be at a total loss  also the sound was terrible  i couldnt make out half of what the actors were saying
Oct 23 2021,positive,i liked the look and sound of the new movie it looks fabulous and the acting is pretty good
Oct 23 2021,positive,an excellent adaptation of the first half of the novel dune ive been reading dune since highschool and it was amazing to see it adapted so well especially given previous attempts it also should be accessible enough that sci fi fans who havent read the book can still enjoy the movie 
Oct 23 2021,positive,pretty lame and drawn out  i liked the 80s lynch adaptation better in its ability to move a complicated setting along  the only plus eas updated special effects but the poor adaptation just leaves you bored
Oct 23 2021,positive,please go watch this at the cinema you will feel like cinematic history is unraveling right in front of your eyes no need to know anything about dune beforehand
Oct 23 2021,negative,not worth the time why did they bother with a remake again
Oct 23 2021,positive,visual and audio spectacle the writing and narrative is great i felt like it was a great adaptation of the book there were some minor changes here and there as expected but overall it was very faithful and i hope there is a part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,soooo good do yourself a favor go watch it 
Oct 23 2021,positive,track with me    outside of infinity war and endgame theres never been a movie i have anticipated with greater fervor than 2021s dune     my first encounter with the story was reading through it in the heart of covid using the novel as an escape from a troubling and chaotic time having been fairly unassuming of the novel prior to exposure i ended up plowing through 800 pages in three days     dune is unlike any story ive ever encountered at first sight it appears to be a simple whitesavior chosen one runofthemill story but its so much more ironically dune would go on to lay the groundwork for star wars harry potter and similar stories who would steal the model of dunes protagonist while removing the nuance     what makes the story of dune great is that paul may be the protagonist but he is no hero     its story is one that resembles historical accounts more than a classic heros journey there is no good there is no bad everything holds the potency for evil everything holds the potency for good nothing ever really ends    and thats not to say that dune inherently is a dismissive or simplistic story by avenue of its decision to not choose absolutes it inherits complexity and digs in its heels to the gambit of themes present the role of women in politics parents learning to be alright with watching their children be in danger conquering fear    i could go on and yet frank herberts masterpiece has been considered ever since its original publishing to be unadaptable im happy to say that villeneuve has achieved the immaculate     im blown away and was so happy to genuinely be thrilled in the theater once again after a slew of subpar and even heartbreaking movies im looking at you the green knight    in response to your sorrowtinged question maddie im not quite done with film not yet dune has restored my joy        fear is the mind killer
Oct 23 2021,positive,this is a masterpiece the sound and visual adaptations made my jaw drop this is the first movie i rate ever it really got me exited all the time and ode to the scifi
Oct 23 2021,positive,beyond what i expected a well made movie can make you lose track of time but an exceptionally well made movie will make you want rewind time and enjoy the movie again like it was the very first time man i wish i could rewind time
Oct 23 2021,negative,the visual were good but the story was dragged on too much and was difficult to follow the characters were not very relatable i am a great dune fan but i was expecting cinematography somewhere between  a marvel movie and blade runner and this was not it also the sound volumes were horrible the narrator or character voices were often a faint murmur while the spaceship scenes were a deafening roar the music selection was not great either so mr villeneuve you can do better
Oct 23 2021,positive,only because they made half the movies but well done for first half of the store it was pretty good
Oct 23 2021,positive,many eminent filmmakers eg david lynch have already found out that herberts novel is difficult to adapt   this time one of the best directors of contemporary cinema tried to do it  denis villeneuve blade runner 2049 sicario    from the very beginning we are hypnotized by the monumental landscapes of the desert planet arrakis enjoying the slow blunt shots we hear the extremely killmatic music of hans zimmer which perfectly fits into the mysterious and dark world    the very story of paul atryda timothée chalamet causes great admiration we observe a young man heir to the throne of the atreides family he has to overcome his fear to become what he should be  villeneuve perfectly shows the way of this character in addition it creates interesting supporting characters thanks to which we understand the main protagonists motivation even more actors impersonating villains deserve special attention stellan skarsgãrd and dave bautista are impressive in terms of facial expressions and body language the entire cast performs decently but not outstandingly this is the result of the directors choices who focuses mainly on showing beautiful landscapes so sometimes he does not let these talented actors show off  another small problem is the screenplay especially the ending lacks a strong punch line of this amazing story    to sum up denis villeneuves dune despite its small problems is not only one of the directors best films but also one of the most important works of cinematography in the 21st century
Oct 23 2021,positive,its time to say we have the most impressive film of 2021 denis villeneuves dune is an impressive auteur blockbuster that becomes one of the best films of 2021 one of the cinematic experiences of the year and one of the musical works of the anus    denis villeneuve is once again consolidated as one of the best directors today frankly i think that only this director could have adapted frank herberts novel in such greatness an adaptation practically faithful to the novel and that villeneuve takes the trouble to make it in 2 parts    the first part that the director builds for us is an amazing introduction to the world of dune with the delicate work of representing the lands the planets and the environment arrakis is to feel that you are recording on a real planet in the same way the time that its director dedicates to the presentation of each character    timothée chalamet is very well directed and manages to enter the skin of paul atreides with a performance that is pure feeling the complexity of the character the young actor represents it correctly we understand the journey and the beginning of the arc that must be carried out during the film which is obviously unfinished and which can be developed in the second part rebecca ferguson likewise provides an impeccable performance that increases her strength as the film progresses    the villain theme is perhaps the films weakest point in a way they feel not entirely exploited and remain in sporadic appearances either way the baron of stellan skarsgård is an interpretive as well as creative madness    the work that denis villeneuve has achieved is a show in all its dimensions the camera set by villeneuve of wide shots of geometry in each one of them of details that he always knows how to highlight and of a staging as he wants it to be at all times that is complemented by the immense photography of greig fraser who seems to understand the mind of his director to the maximum detail monstrous visual effects from the environments to the worms you do not doubt that they are real artistically the film is also a pleasure where the lights are carried by the clothes especially the one worn by rebecca ferguson    the icing on the cake is none other than hans zimmer and his marvelous musical creation wow the creation of every chord melody and note that he uses to accompany denis villeneuves work is mindboggling    the first part of dune is a work that is simmered with the best possible ingredients to wait for the final tasting with all the highest possible expectations you can have    there is a possibility that you do not like what you are seeing in a certain way because it is a movie that takes all the time in the world to explain things from pauls dream dreams to each kingdom that is part of the story however if you connect with it the first time it is a trip to perhaps one of the most spectacular visual experiences of the year and of recent times    a film that deserves to be seen in theaters to measure its spectacular nature
Oct 23 2021,positive,faithful to the books without needing to go wordforword or constant exposition
Oct 23 2021,positive,truly amazing absolutely made for the big screen
Oct 23 2021,positive,this is an excellent realization of the novel with images as i imagined them when i read it 44 years ago the film nicely compresses the sprawling narrative even if it must conclude half way with part ii to follow the special effects were seamless i thought the dialogue was a little difficult to hear at times
Oct 23 2021,positive,saw it in imax and immediately watched it again the next morning at home as a fan of the book i thought it was immensely faithful while cutting out only the parts that arent necessary to the story the score and cinematography are nothing short of a masterpiece go see dune get them to make part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,brilliantly done the pace is just perfect the world building in the first half of the movie is simply amazing as someone who loves the books i did appreciate the efforts to bring to life so many small details in the story building naturally they made changes and couldnt fit everything from the book but there are many hints and references that help to guide your imagination in just the right direction the cast is brilliant everyone delivers an amazing performance the suspense has you from the very first to the last minute of the movie cant wait for part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,this film is an easy 910 for those who arent familiar with scifi as a genre not dune the novel the slow tempo in the beginning is to be expected with that said the film does an amazing job of setting the stage and backstory thats simple and digestible for the viewer one of the primary problems with frank herberts novel is that it immediately thrusts the reader into a complex universe full of complex intricacies with little explanation its up to the reader to understand and grow their knowledge over the course of the book the film does the opposite in an elegant and unforced way which was refreshing and great for film the plot is very similar to the original book less a few minor adjustments which were actually improved upon in my humble opinion the world portrayed in the film is dark complex and massive just how herbert dreamed it up nearly every scene in the film was depicted exactly how herbert drafted it even adding some additional uniqueness to supplement herberts writing the score was incredible and we have a new scifi classic on our hands cant wait to see how the 2nd have of the novel plays out in pt ii
Oct 23 2021,negative,slowboring and long and this is part 1 flat acting except for aqua man who smiles cgi cool as usual so thats the main positive 
Oct 23 2021,positive,absolutely loved this movie possibly one of the best scifi visual story telling thats been released in a generation
Oct 23 2021,positive,this movie is phenomenal and exactly what dune is suppose to be its a must watch on the big screen movie
Oct 23 2021,positive,the casting is spot on they created beautiful worlds it did not feel like 25 hours i just wanted more
Oct 23 2021,positive,slow build to a cliff hangar ending with action drama tension world building backstabbing and incredible action packed in between when i heard this heralded as the next lord of the rings my expectations became unrealistically high but this visionary masterpiece that denis villenueve has directed met if not succeeded my expectations my advice to the casual viewer  listen closely the movie isnt too confusing political power grab main character rising to unsuspected power but to understand the inner workings its best to avoid talking throughout would highly recommend
Oct 23 2021,negative,what could have been an amazing movie turned out to be a bit of a mess the pacing was off the entire movie with dramatic emphasis on what seemed to be random moments of starships lifting off or dramatic scenery outshined important moments regarding the main points of the story had i not known the lore of dune prior to the movie i would have struggled to understand what was going on this is because the dialogue regarding those important parts of the plot were expressed in the smallest of conversations and said very passively and no emphasis was placed on what the audience should be listening for   the story also never seems to climax with one major battle and then a smaller one eventually leading them towards the mcs destiny   the thing is i really wanted this movie to be great as i love the lore of dune i even paused the movie several times to explain to my wife what was going on as i got excited when things were revealed but after the 4th time i realized that many of the important parts of the plot were hard to grasp for the average watcher because of the way the dialogue lacked emphasis on what was being said or the timing would be off or theyd use other languages randomly without proper buildup or explanation   conclusion to get the most out of this movie youll have to watch some breakdowns of the lore of dune on youtube before watching it and that in itself is sad because the movie itself should be enough to get the audience interested in the dune universe
Oct 23 2021,positive,great adaptation of the book does the source material good by keeping to the story and cant wait for the second part
Oct 23 2021,positive,should have finished the first book
Oct 23 2021,negative,it was too long and the story was difficult to follow i still dont know what it was really about
Oct 23 2021,positive,acting was good etc just very slow paced
Oct 23 2021,positive,after watching when i left the cinema in a stream of audience one of the main feelings was surprise that so many people far from this direction of cinematography and literature have come and continue to come to watch dune  its the same as people would throw down crowds on angelic conversations villeneuve somehow deceived everyone and made them watch pure poetry for two and a half hours  i really liked the movie it completely coincided with my feelings from this universe in which i practically lived in my thirteenth the books from the dune cycle were my bible many quotes i still remember by heart and i never settle myself with my back to a door
Oct 23 2021,positive,just as i imagined while reading the books thank you denis
Oct 23 2021,positive,incredibly faithful take on the novel with its focus very much being pauls arc out of his youth villeneuves most mainstream movie yet while still completely retaining his artistic touch  fortunately not the generic popcorn adventure movie some trailers made it seem to be love it as a dune fan saw it with friends who knew nothing about dune and enjoyed it a lot  seen the movie 3 times by now might be my favorite cinematic experience so far
Oct 23 2021,negative,wow this movie was just not good while i also thought the book was mostly boring i can say this movie perfectly capsulates it at least the first half of the book  the plotstory just isnt there they explain nothing besides a blurb at the start zendaya and jason momoa each have maybe 5 minutes of screen time i cant say anything about timothee chalamet since this is the first thing ive seen him in the rest of the cast was fine  rebecca fergusons acting in this is just terrible her line delivery plus some of the audio mixing choices make it where you can barely hear what she is saying the audio cues and mixes happen a lot to the point where you knew exactly what it meant if you are so inclined to see this id suggest a free trial of hbo max
Oct 23 2021,positive,enjoyed it very much
Oct 23 2021,positive,excellent looked gorgeous
Oct 23 2021,positive,dune was absolutely epic it was just like the book in nearly every way aside from a few changes that were very minor in my opinion insane experience and cant wait for part 2 and part 3 potentially well done
Oct 23 2021,neutral,utterly disappointing and guess what it was part 1 of   i am surprised with such a great cast this was such a letdown i had tickets to see it for the second time and have canceled
Oct 23 2021,positive,going in im very concern that this may bored me because of all the trailers well after watching it i am now a fan
Oct 23 2021,positive,great movie and look forward to part 2 followup
Oct 23 2021,negative,boring i nearly walked out of this movie because of how boring i found it the only thing that kept me in my seat was curiosity
Oct 23 2021,positive,loved the effects and story line the cast is unmatched
Oct 23 2021,negative,hard to understand what and why this all happened  did not like it
Oct 23 2021,positive,the movie is great but 2nd half is more low paced then the first haflf but still the scope is huge
Oct 23 2021,positive,i did enjoy it and do recommend it you dont see her much in the trailers but rebecca fergusons role is a major reason why this works cant wait for part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,epic grownup mindblowing imagery
Oct 23 2021,positive,finally the adaptation to the big screen that dune deserves fantastic acting sublime photography and electrifying soundtrack i cant wait for the following ones if you are a dune novels fan you will absolutely love it
Oct 23 2021,positive,some all time epic visuals and a compelling story
Oct 23 2021,positive,the story line is perfect and follows the series acting is superb and this movie already fills in a lot of holes in the earlier dune movie only disappointment is having to wait so long for part 2 o  definitely worth watchinggreat special effects
Oct 23 2021,positive,the visuals  audio are incredible its an experience which must be seen only on big screen
Oct 23 2021,positive,i greatly enjoyed this movie  it is fairly faithful to the original novel  however i still cannot get over timothe hal chalamet as paul  as a young teen he would be fine  however i can never see someone that thin short and boyish having the gravitas to be warrior emperor and leader of a spacecult  the muabdib  as a certain president is known to say come on man i think he is a good actor but i think he is miscast  hopefully if they make it to a part iii the person who plays leto is more appropriately cast
Oct 23 2021,positive,this movie version of dune is an instant classic it will be watched over and over again for years to come i had two immediate reactions as the final credits started to roll when is part 2 coming out and where is the nearest imax where i can see this again    the pacing is perfect perfect having seen timothee chalamet in the title role of the king i knew he would be an outstanding paul atreides the whole tale of dune is very much about this one characters transformation only someone with real heft and the control to not let too much be revealed too soon can portray him well chalamet is perfect those who are unfamiliar with his work are in for a treat    much will be made of the cinematography which absolutely demands to be seen on the biggest screen possible the score by hans zimmer is as stunning as the images in my opinion they are perfectly paired    this is just part one of a very long story it took a half hour for the audience i was in to settle down and understand what they were about to see this isnt some slambang cgi fest this is a noholdsbarred science fiction movie the likes of which we get only once every few decades it draws you in and slowly captures your attention until your world falls away
Oct 23 2021,positive,i think only deni can make you feel so insignificant before a ginormous space tube  i really hope to see part 2 of the story
Oct 23 2021,positive,great show can not wait to see part2
Oct 23 2021,positive,great world building cinematography and visuals definitely a high quality movie although can be a slow burn at times cant wait for part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,this film is a modern masterpiece
Oct 23 2021,positive,an absolutely perfect film
Oct 23 2021,positive,loved this movie as a huge fan of the dune book series this lived up to most expectations the beauty and scale of the world was impressive and the cast is amazing would have like to see more of the political scheming but i can tell why that part was removed from the movie some pacing issues some parts too fast some too slow but overall this was a piece of art worthy of frank herberts legacy
Oct 23 2021,positive,very cinematic and extremely fascinating and immersive experience for every aspect of the film strong acting cinematography score and setting highly recommend watching this seminal piece of film
Oct 23 2021,positive,great adaptation from the book but there are some references that may not be clear if you havent read the book first   a few things happen at a different point than in the book but overall exceptional  i plan to go again
Oct 23 2021,positive,the acting and cinematography were top notch as a fan of the books they were very loyal to the source material while also using effective creative expression that made the experience that much more enjoyable the action was well choreographed and made me feel like i was part of the battles storywise its a slower movie that focuses in on the political situation and the characterization of people well be with throughout the hopeful sequels while covering a relatively smaller chunk of the book but its because there is so much to pull from there i really liked this interpretation of jessica the baron  paul im anxiously awaiting the sequels cleared for development because ill be one of the first people heading back to the theaters for it
Oct 23 2021,positive,good movie that starts slow and ends strong even if it wasnt based on a book and prior movie some of the plot and characters would seem unoriginal leaves the viewer looking forward to part ii more than enjoying part i of the new dune
Oct 23 2021,positive,more of this please
Oct 23 2021,positive,bleak and underwhelming the first half is a visual feast of panoramic cgi but the films weaknesses dominate the second half specifically weak dialogue and anaemic character development reveal a lack of focus on the fundamentals while villeneuve overcompensates with relentless screaming soundscapes and neverending repeated closeups what little dialogue there is is barely audible i honestly cant remember much of the second half besides feeling bored and irritated by the droning noise and complete lack of personality chamolets acting has been praised but its mostly flat and the intended emotional complexity with his mother is lifeless fans will still enjoy it but we get all of the irritations of bladerunner 2049 without any of its charisma the first half is cinematic scifi deliciousness but the second half is sandy and dull like a desert dune but not like a masterpiece
Oct 23 2021,positive,the film was an absolute spectacle for start to finish  i highly recommend watching it in imax for the best experience
Oct 23 2021,positive,i have mixed feelings about this adventure the actors are perfect the build up for the tone of the movie is way too long action scenes are edit perfect toward the end the set up for part two wasnt smooth it left you hanging and wanting more like a netflix series i feel like that transition could of been smoother i feel like i was uninvited to a party at that last minoverall good job
Oct 23 2021,positive,a perfect movie one for the sci fi fans to celebrate something done in a scale worthy of a box office franchise being born and what cast marvel star wars and dc but this movie must be scene on the big screen not to be missed
Oct 23 2021,positive,excellent adaptation of the book very well acted and directed great character development visuals and soundscapes
Oct 23 2021,negative,boring trys to be way to dramatic with the sweeping epic type music yet zero entertainment omg i wanted to walk out so bad what a joke of a movie
Oct 23 2021,negative,it ended right when i thought the heros journey was about to start if i had paid actual money instead of torrenting it i would probably be disgruntled but i ended up only losing 90 minutes of my life so just got up early the next day to compensate   the lad seemed happy that his father had been brutally murdered and world obliterated im not sure what the message is supposed to be  kill your parents for validation  it was beautifully shot but doesnt seem to go anywhere perhaps its a well funded student art project
Oct 23 2021,positive,visually a great movie needs to be renamed almost dune though or maybe not quite dune three quarters dune
Oct 23 2021,positive,the visual is different but because they use a lot of dark frames so it is hard to watch also the movie pace is very slow 25 hours film in some part it gets boring  not too exciting of course there is no ending in this movie more sequel next
Oct 23 2021,positive,a glorious start to an epic saga where every scene is a visual spectacle filled with atmospheric and dramatic music  every part of this film is on an epic scale from the explosive and exciting action scenes to the spectacular cgi landscapes and special effects  the film is mostly about setting the scene explaining the story and who the main players are which is informative and welltold but it does make it a bit slow and possibly too long overall  the strong characterization and great acting makes up for this and i for one cant wait to see the next chapter
Oct 23 2021,positive,i loved this movie for some this might move slowly but its all about the development of the characters and understanding of this universe beautifully cast and visually stunning im all in for part two 
Oct 23 2021,positive,disappointed i have to wait on part 2 but loved it but i already loved the first dune
Oct 23 2021,positive,i could hardly breathe throughout the movie stunning on all levels just one word to describe this film masterpiece
Oct 23 2021,positive,this is moving making at its best  cinematography check  music check  acting yep  and its captures the book like no one else has  i felt i was on dune myself i felt the words the power of dune itself what more can i say if your fan of sci fi see it  if fan of the book see it  support this great work of masterpiece it is
Oct 23 2021,positive,very well done as close to perfect as any adaption of such a sprawling novel could ever be as two lovers of the original books my wife and i greatly enjoyed this adventure and are very much looking forward to the second half of dune we will probably watch this initial installment a few times before then 
Oct 23 2021,positive,i hope it would perform well at the box office or else we would have another unfinished film
Oct 23 2021,negative,predictably boring if youre into special effects this is the movie for you so where is the great hue and cry from twitter about the racially insensitive casting of the fremen guess its howls of discrimination dont apply when the characters are supposed to look like arabs
Oct 23 2021,positive,i dont rate very many movies in here but holy mother of god this movie was absolutely phenomenal i couldnt not leave a review for it absolutely beautiful cgi beautiful soundtrack beautiful costume design a
Oct 23 2021,negative,despite excellent cinematography and some decent perfomances from the cast dune is slow uninteresting and feels way too long for its own good definitely a step back for director villeneuve after the excellent blade runner 2049 510
Oct 23 2021,positive,this epic tale has been attempted to be told on the big screen and on the small screen throughout the past 30 plus years to see this film make the book come alive the way it has and keep most of the deepness of its incredible storyline without feeling like its dragging is an incredible feat part two needs to be immediately green lit to retain this awesome crew and cast the studio has lit the torch hopefully it wont douse it
Oct 23 2021,positive,denis villeneuve never disappoints hits every mark cannot wait for part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,there is nothing like dune the best way i can describe it is an out of body experience it is insane to me to think that all of this came from the mind of one person this is an incredible adaptation of an unadaptable novel with incredibly visceral direction music and performances denis villeneuve does an amazing job at conveying the vast lore and plot details in an engaging and entertaining way the plot never feels confusing and is very fast paced and engaging even with the large amount of exposition it has to convey  an absolute must see if you are a fan of science fiction or just film in general
Oct 23 2021,positive,i went into this knowing nothing about the original movie or the book this was an amazing movie one of the years best 
Oct 23 2021,positive,compared to majority recent movies dune was a really good movie the pace the detail the story in general the actors everything was well put together it feels as a cinematic work rather than a just a product for getting money it tells the story well the choices made for splitting the story in to several movies is good    to any people working and funding such projects should not be stopped as this is right course for reaching new hights in the cinematic world
Oct 23 2021,positive,ive never felt this way watching a movie each scene looked like it was a painted mural i would want to hang on my wall every scene was breathtaking the worldbuilding is mindblowing and the soundtrack is perfectly complementary to the movie and plot one thing i cant praise it enough for is that it doesnt need to overexplain or have long lines of exposition as so many awful movies do nowadays and yet i always knew what was going on based on the clues laid out for me and i have never read or watched older dune versions before truly a work of art and instantly one of my favorite movies going to go back and watch it on imax to get the full experience because my friends and i had a watch party streaming at home to see how it is and boy were we not disappointed 1000010 recommend  on top of all this i watched the movie with my partner and his friend both of them have read the book and followed all the adaptations and my partner is a super stingy film criticvery hard to please by the end of the movie all of us were talking excitedly about all the little details and what we liked or theories we had based on clues in the film i cannot describe how hard it is to get all of us loving the same movie and genre but dang dune 2021 really pulled it off
Oct 23 2021,positive,awesome movie best seen in theaters  cant wait for part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,best cinematic experience ever
Oct 23 2021,positive,colonialism for resources betray for blood ancient old bureaucracy  political assassination still spread to intergalactic civilisation nothing really fresh here high technology it might be but still fighting with swords please
Oct 23 2021,positive,absolutely gorgeous visually stunning sound and superb acting of this ultimate story on epic grand scale instant classic on a par with kubrick dune was the first science fiction book i read as a child and it hugely impacted my life it was absolute joy to see the story unfold onscreen for villeneuve to achieve this which offers deep depth that herbert himself would likely be pleased with is so remarkable thank you to every person who was on villeneuves dune team it is a treasure much needed at this time
Oct 23 2021,positive,i loved it so much amazing visuals and efficient story that stayed true to the book score was absolutely amazing performances were great
Oct 23 2021,positive,any reviews less than five star would be a hate crime  please watch it as many times as possible  can not wait to see the other half  though it is a shame there is not much of zendaya w
Oct 23 2021,negative,compared to dune 1984 this one is pure shit  there is no empathy of any kind from the actors at all  if you are watching this film for the first time you will experience it as magnificent and incredibly well made  if you go in depth on the film it is not connected at all  the film is about the spice but you do not see the use of it when atredis travels to arakis you do not see that the spice bends the space  there are many good actors in this movie but the direction of the movie is hopeless  the effects in the movie are incredibly well made but seemed to work better in apples foundation
Oct 23 2021,positive,a beautiful adaptation of the book covers book 1 and about half of book 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,stunning sounds and visuals cant wait for the sequel
Oct 23 2021,positive,the visuals and the tone are greatthe actors were great and it followed the novel almost preciselypart 2 should be great
Oct 23 2021,positive,im honestly convinced that dennis can do no harm if youre a fan of his work dune is definitely a must watch like blade runner 2049 dune is a slow burn of a movie but its because of its slow burn that youre able to feel fully immerse in this universe that frank herbert created the cinematography paired with the visual fx score script and all star cast is what made me give this movie a perfect score dennis has miraculously combined blockbuster scope with art house film please please please let there be a part 2 one last thing this film is definitely a modern epic 1010
Oct 23 2021,negative,i was really hoping for a great cinematic experience and for me that includes story and tone not just cool visuals to me this is a brooding slow boring less interesting version of avatar another white male savior to rescue the indigenous people from the white colonialists story to be sure but when that story is wrapped in the exciting world of avatar i can let the old tropes slide a bit but sadly here theres nothing to keep my thoughts from wandering into that mindset
Oct 23 2021,positive,only wish i could get part 2 tomorrow
Oct 23 2021,positive,amazing well put together movie cant wait for the next one
Oct 23 2021,positive,i was super excited to watch dune and my expectations were very high and i can happily say this movie went beyond my expectations 100 a mustsee and one of the best movies iv seen in theaters in a long time i hope we get a part 2 so we can see more of this amazing world and characters and get an ending for this amazing tale
Oct 23 2021,negative,while visually stunning  this star studded movie left us feeling as though we ourselves drifted through a wasteland to a mirage only to discover it was just that as we grovel through the sands of time waiting for the movie to end we find an emptiness where we should have felt hope and fatigue from a fleeting plot that kept us churning on the same hamster wheel one step too far will throw you back full circle only to start once more trying to move forward not much happened in part i  the occasional anticlimatic fight scene  lots of walkingrunning and a weird notsoslender slender man   with the egregious progression into our protagonists story i hope to see more with the new addition to the series
Oct 23 2021,negative,the visuals are very awesome but the movie was too long most of the time i felt like i was watching them walk in the desert not what i expected and not as entertaining
Oct 23 2021,positive,denis villeneuve made a visual masterpiece exhilarating great performances 
Oct 23 2021,positive,i liked that the movie was detailed pay close attention my fam loved it
Oct 23 2021,positive,excellent adaptation i dont agree with some criticisms regarding the ending this story was a wellpaced faithful adaptation of the original book the ending correlated well with the narrative arc of herberts noveland it a visual ready to boot must see on the biggest screen possible
Oct 23 2021,positive,visually stunninng and epic i love it
Oct 23 2021,positive,1010 great acting pacing action beautifully shot i love this world please make part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,great story action effects and drama  cast was awesome
Oct 23 2021,positive,very close to the feel of the book  minor plot simplifications without hurting the playlines  if youre a dune fan it is a mustsee
Oct 23 2021,positive,slow 12 a movie too long for nothing really happening glad i didnt over pay to see in a theater
Oct 23 2021,positive,dune is one of the most  if not the most  visually pleasing movies ive ever seen the phenomenal visuals the music the acting everything is superb and sucks you in completely denis villeneuve really did create a masterpiece with this one can only highly recommend as for the plot dune is obviously a must seeread scifi classic with rich indepth world building some people might find it a bit confusing but for me the vagueness only added to this dreamlike entrancing experience of a movie i cried four times due to the artful visuals i guess this sums it up well
Oct 23 2021,positive,watch it in theater or you just waste a chance to feel a magnificent film  去大螢幕看最好是imax否則就浪費了一場視覺饗宴最好什麼預告都別看抱著一個開放的心態去感受一個新的世界給你的體驗
Oct 23 2021,positive,i have never seen something like this before so much gorgeousness and emotion in one movie the soundtrack was amazing
Oct 23 2021,positive,it was the longest movie about nothing   acting was great visually great very long and i wanted more story then i got it was cool in theaters i didnt know there was more then one part when i went into it
Oct 23 2021,positive,amazing visuals well played cast perfectly scored  be sure to catch it on good screen with great sound like dolby atmos
Oct 23 2021,positive,due to not reading the book this film was an adventure on par with interstellar music makes you feel the movie superb cinematography fantastic story telling cant wait for part 2 
Oct 23 2021,neutral,dune is extremely cinematic and extremely boring
Oct 23 2021,positive,a masterclass in film making well paced visually spectacular and a perfect moody score as true to the source material as is reasonable one of the best films i have seen in a long time
Oct 23 2021,positive,due to not reading the books that was probably the most adventurous film since interstellar music makes you feel the movie superb cinematography fantastic story telling cant wait for part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,visual master piece acting was so convincing and real
Oct 23 2021,negative,slow the slowest slow that ever slowed
Oct 23 2021,positive,awesome movie denis villenevue reminds us of what movies should be beautiful visuals and epic serenading music drowns you in this 25 hour sci fi ocean it takes its freaking time which i like but never feels slow definitely worth it to see on the big screen if you hbo max it youre missing out unless your sound system is on point
Oct 23 2021,positive,wow everything here is very impressive the art direction especially very inventive very fresh in that regard    the muted drab colours and dark lighting work well for the universe established i always thought the lynch version was lit too brightly considering the dreary plot    the protagonist is a bit bland in fact every character except jason momoas and stellan skarsgards are pretty boring but thats ok because there is plenty of engagement around these characters in this epic like the plot and the world coming to life    a very cold shakespearean scifi this one
Oct 23 2021,positive,incredible job im a huge fan of the original and this lived up to the hype
Oct 23 2021,negative,this movie was dog shit honestly no action and had no idea what was going on
Oct 23 2021,negative,the visuals and the score were amazing beyond beautiful but the plot on the other hand boring at half of the movie i though what are they doing its never explained what they want their motivations things just happen and i just didnt understand the reason of them some characters died and i just didnt care i never got to care about these characters because i never understood them this movie has a lot of worldbuilding which is never explored nor explained after i left the cinema i talked to a friend who had already watched the movie and has read the book and told me that in fact only the people that already read the book could understand the movie and i find that a terrible idea the point of making an adaptation is that it can be watched on its own that its enough to understand it but im not going to read a book that long only to understand a movie which i really didnt care about timothée chalamet is an amazing actor as always but i just didnt care about his character on the other hand there were a lot of stars in this film that were promoted to have a huge role but appeared less then 5 minutes like zendaya and thats just fake advertising the only thing enjoyable about this movie is the visuals and score but unfortunately for me thats not enough if the story is gonna be this confusing
Oct 23 2021,negative,i cant believe i feel for the hype i was incredibly confused right off the bat and there were so many questions left unanswered the ending felt like it came out of no where it was really random i tried to like this but its awful as a sifi movie goes its horrible they kept using earth terms which broke the immersion every time i saw the bulls head or someone playing the bag pipes i could not hold in my laughter i was told its better if you go into this without reading the book but i wish i had maybe then i wouldnt be completely confused as to how duncan idaho yes his last name is idaho was related to the main cast there were a couple redeeming moments but for the most part this movie is laughable zendaya only has like 2 lines in the whole movie would not recommend especially if youre going to spend time and money going to the theater
Oct 23 2021,positive,cant wait for part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,i love the book dune and was excited if skeptical for this movie they did a great job both streamlining the story and giving us enough time to live in the world the production design was incredible rebecca ferguson was a standout i reeeaallly hope there is a part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,honestly amazing true enough to the book to please the reader the only changes were to help the moviegoer understand and i thought it was extremely well done 1110
Oct 23 2021,positive,sci fi done right the film attacks your senses and does not relent until the last frame its slow burn pacing really builds a sense of epicness indulgent in all the right ways cant wait for part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,great pace 2 the story wonderful cinematics  wardrobe  the soundtrack is a lil distracting times
Oct 23 2021,positive,honestly i found it a little boring too many names in this movie which have like 10 min of screen time and then find their demise i expected more especially with 2hrs and 40min and for that reason i feel that each characters death is as emotionless as the next due to the fact that i wasnt given enough time to like any of them the movie is all paul all the time and mund you i think he can be kind of a jersey who becomes full of himself when he realizes his dad is dead and he now is the man like really when he says he can change the world with a wave of a hand cuz he has the power now smh idki was just left 
Oct 23 2021,positive,read the novel and this movie was just a masterpiece i mean its a must watch absolutely beautiful
Oct 23 2021,positive,no one can capture the grandiosity of dune as well as denis villeneuve and hans zimmer this film will leave you in awe looking forward to an even better sequel
Oct 23 2021,positive,really good history driven at least from my perspective i didnt felt the time hope they get to do the other chapters    gc
Oct 23 2021,negative,a weak adaptation to the amazing dune movie even compared to the miniseries tv adaptation from 2000 this is not so good of a movie timothée chalamet whos a gret actorthe king and others is portrayed as a rather weak individual at the beginning of movie at the last 10 minutes the character paul gains some of its wits but a bit too late many of the fine interact details and interactions are missing in the movie rendering the whole fabric of the plot unclear and soft the movie end abruptly as a first episode in a tv series would great actors bad script and direction too bad
Oct 23 2021,positive,i saw this newest movie release at the imax in huntsville al yesterday  it was fabulous except for one extremely important point  the audio dialogue was frequently very difficult to hear and understand  i was so looking forward to this and i am so disappointed about the audio dialogue
Oct 23 2021,positive,i really like this movie  and it was one of the best scifi movies ive ever seen i like that they took it serious this is how star wars should have been like
Oct 23 2021,positive,dune was so much better than i couldve even hoped the casting was perfect visually i cant think of a more beautiful movie cinematography was also probably the best i can think of the musicscore throughout the whole movie really made you feel like you were on a different world and that this was an epic im praying part two gets the green light because they barely made it halfway through the book     i could not keep a smile off my face the entire movie it was so damn cool
Oct 23 2021,positive,as a fan of the original novel i have been disappointed with previous attempts to bring this incredible novel to the screen  attempts that focus on the shoot em up genre and ignored all the mystical and cultural aspects of the book denis villeneuve nailed it i felt like standing up and cheering at the end of the movie and look forward to future installments if youre a video gamer  forget it if youre a true fan of authentic science fiction and have taken the time to read the novel  this is not to be missed
Oct 23 2021,positive,i was surprised that they made this into a 3 part film i was hoping they wood because there is so much depth in the book the arthur creates an entire universe with politics and religion the original was a good start in wanting to watch a summary of this book however this movie actually captures the story line and has good character development as well although its a little slow which if you read the book you would know part 1 is a little slower then the rest of the book part one of the movie like the book builds the foundation of the rest of the story the book is a must read im very excited to see the rest of the franchise come and and to see how they create the world that was beautiful done by frank herbert
Oct 23 2021,positive,if you didnt see it in imax you didnt see it
Oct 23 2021,positive,wow this movie is awesome it could easily be this decades lotrs  a must see i have read all the books by frank herbert and i am impressed and cant wait for the next movie  going home to watch it again on hbo max
Oct 23 2021,positive,beautiful and perfect
Oct 23 2021,positive,great overall hopefully the start to a new star hopping scifi franchise stunning visuals down to the last grain of sand with astonishing cgi worms and thopters that make the og dune movies fx look completely stone age by comparison the movies score is filled with strangled tribal calls over frantic drums that feels very fremen in nature and mostly works the music shines during climactic explosive moments but at times feels like its building unnecessary suspense where plot doesnt require it the sound mixing and editing in general were excellent lots of vibrations felt through the seats in the theater especially noticable with the unique way the director chose to portray the voice if anyones questioning the 25 hour commitment it never felt long or drawn out the length of the film was a plus as far as covering details from the book closely with only a few plot points from the source changed or missing see keynes gender swap or missing greenhousewarning note honestly i wouldnt have minded even more screen time to get to know side characters like duncan and gurney better gurney not playing the baliset felt like a missed characterbuilding opportunity the performances from jessica and paul were solid but again time wasnt taken to capture the intricacies of jessicas conflicted feelings towards pauls growing prescient abilities as it turns out showing the characters inner thoughts the way theyre presented in the book doesnt easily transfer to the screen short of a narrative voiceover and as for chanis involvement its mostly interspersed dream sequences throughout the film remind us that oh yeah zendaya is in this but sadly the cut off point for part 1 leaves her a brief introduction with paul during the last 10 minutes of the film by the end of the movie the world of arrakis and dune has the basic foundation built but the meat and potatoes of pauls journey lies ahead  hopefully because potential sequels will build on this ground work fewer long panning shots of the dunes and sand storms to establish setting will make time for cleaner and clearer charactersmotivations it will be interesting to see how the story plays with general audiences and if the box office response will affirm the film as the beginning of another blockbuster series
Oct 23 2021,positive,too dark too loud in some parts and mostly barely audible and even worse with disguised voices  too long  terrible storytelling  halfway through i was restless for an ending  no rousing moments  loved the books  was okay with lynch  not waiting for art 2 of this
Oct 23 2021,positive,faithful adaptation beautiful cinematography stunning score  ready for part 2  this is really a movie that must be seen in imax
Oct 23 2021,positive,as someone who is not familiar with the source material i still had an amazing experience watching dune the visual and audio aspects of the film are pretty much flawless and is the peak of what is possible with modern filmmaking every shot is just gorgeous and feels alive it never felt like i was looking at a movie set but an actual world that exists every cast member also gives solid performances with rebecca ferguson being the standout for me the story was engaging from start to finish and despite the slow pace i never felt like the movie dragged the only negative i can give is that it very much feels like the first part of a bigger story and you are left with many unanswered questions by the end but nevertheless its still a strong prologue im intrigued by this world and am excited to see more of it
Oct 23 2021,positive,end of your seat action
Oct 23 2021,positive,an unbelievable masterpiece not only did it bring the book to life it personified in stunning cinematic and auditory performance the very memories that defined my childhood one of the best ive seen in my ears
Oct 23 2021,positive,a far better film than the 1984 version what with its improved passing and less disinterested dialouge honestly hyped for the sequel
Oct 23 2021,positive,dune is a product of love the love a director has for the source material and the unique world setting which created a modern masterpiece this is denis villeneuves passion project and isnt done telling this story this could very well be the beginning of an epic saga that will create a chapter in the book of cinema
Oct 23 2021,positive,very close to the book and i liked it overall but its not complete it could of been trimmed in a few parts and not a fan of the actor that played paul i liked the original version better but this is still good way too many visions and way too many of chani takes away from the movie a little
Oct 23 2021,positive,a sight to behold and a perfect vision of frank herberts book
Oct 23 2021,positive,you have to read the book very difficult to follow otherwise
Oct 23 2021,negative,boring better than the first attempt but not by much
Oct 23 2021,positive,the movie is visually stunning although too monochromatic when reading the book the environs are rich with texture the movie had very little visual depth thats not really fair lets say the texture had little vibrance even a desert environment has rich colors i have nothing but praise for the technical expertise of the film makers but as a fan of the books i felt like the film makers did not actually read the books but wrote script off of cliffnotes there is not enough depth to paul no inner thoughts and if one has read the books the story is mostly inner thoughts of the characters difficult to convey in film yes but the 1980s film did a fairly decent job of it additionally the story explores some very deep religious and social aspects of humanity specifically thinly veiled comments on islam and catholicism very little of which was explored except for some costuming if the entire two and a half hours is going to cover just the first half of the book there could have been some time for exploration and just my personal aside i dont think a review of this film is fair without having read the book the cast was excellent with two exceptions paul the main character has something of a vapid face not in line with the true depth of the character im sure theres huge disagreement with that but its just what i saw also duncan idaho was a scrappy wiry seasoned combatant with as much wile as strength this movie character was a looming steroidriddled hulkasaurus where did that casting decision come from the vehicles were magnificent the environment although monochromatic was epic it is a highly polished slick bigbudget film with big profit written all over it but it is not the dune story thats etched in my mind from mr herberts books all that being said im going back to see it again sober
Oct 23 2021,positive,its not a disappointment visually its spectacular  accoustically it has a complex powerful score that perfectly matches what you see on screen  story wise it falls short one of the great aspects of herberts novel is the complex tapestry of social heirarchy ritual and intrigue  it is only passingly alluded to here though the major plot points are faithfully followed    there are however some deviations that make no sense why for instance did they feel the need to gender swap one of the minor but pivitol characters dr liet kynes  most people wont notice if theyre not familiar with the book but it kept pulling me out of the story  there was no need and no justification made for it that said the actress who played kynes did a good job it just threw me and took me out of the movie which is the one thing you never want to do as a story teller      there are plenty of very powerful capable women in the world and the story so there was need to present change kynes to a female shes not a love interest now there just wasnt any good reason to do it     theres a lot going on in the movie that begs a rewatch and i will be going to see it again and probably again      dune is visually stunning which for me is part of the problem the visuals should be there to support the story and characters but it feels like the characters are just there to give a reason for the beautiful sets costumes and special effects  it seems we can do anything in a movie now days except tell a good story even when were handed one of the best ever written     so why recommend it it falls short but man its a beautifully shot film and that zimmer score is unlike anything youve heard the visuals and the score make this film a visual symphony  gorgeous
Oct 23 2021,negative,most boring movie ever totally lost and fell asleep woke up and left
Oct 23 2021,negative,annoyingly misleading how they used zedaya to advertise this film when the reality is shes barely in it
Oct 23 2021,positive,very accurate band true to the book unfortunately for those who have not read the book and are familiar with the story it can leave some confusion about the plot for much of the film similar to the book  the cinematography is breathtaking and downright masterful at times that way that the voice is portrayed is better than i could have hoped for and shows why the bene geserate are a force to be reckoned with i cannot wait for part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,this film felt like a game changer for modern cinema and a breath of fresh air for book to movie adaptations the attention to detail and the world building is absolutely phenomenal incredible acting all around
Oct 23 2021,positive,gorgeous film subtleties evenly matched the spectacle of effects and settings
Oct 23 2021,positive,what i saw thought they did well but seriously wheres the other half of the movie
Oct 23 2021,positive,obsessed the music the visuals the spice wow wow a must see
Oct 23 2021,positive,incredibly interesting its a patient movie  which seems rare the direction and cinematography are on point 
Oct 23 2021,positive,great movie epic good world building the score is out of this world the shots are amazing
Oct 23 2021,positive,compared to the junk being churned out by hollywood recently this is great
Oct 23 2021,positive,im thirtyfour prior to seeing this film i have not read the novels but i saw the 84 version and brushed up on some youtube dune background information     ive never walked out of a movie theater feeling so satisfied as i did tonight likewise ive never been more interested in a story as i am right now ever even as a star wars kid lord of the rings teenager or star trek young adult     i have zero critiques to offer this is the cinematic definition of a masterpiece and i cannot wait to read dune having purchased it an hour after i got home    the film cast and crew are exquisite i encourage you to give them your money so that they may continue and if for financial reasons they cannot then this film will suffice but i would truly love to see more
Oct 23 2021,positive,everything i hoped for and nothing i was afraid about  after 20 minutes preview i expected it to be spectacular and it was definitely must see it again and im already eagerly waiting for the part two
Oct 23 2021,positive,not only is the movie superbly made well acted visually stunning etc but its about as perfect an adaptation of the book as you can possibly get critics who complain about the pace of the movie are really complaining about the book not the movie the pacing and plot follow the book almost to the letter
Oct 23 2021,positive,bring on the next chapter 
Oct 23 2021,positive,best scifi adaptation ive seen in a very very long time and definitely one of the best movies of 2021 jawdropping cinematography enchanting score grandiose worldbuilding extremely talented cast larger than life story  the brilliant direction of denis villeneuve all coherently weave together to form something that is nothing short of a masterpiece this is the one sequel i will be looking forward to
Oct 23 2021,positive,i consider myself incredibly picky with this genre and this is 1010 best fantasy sci fi since lotr hands down so nice to have a serious work of art rather than the disneyfied everything we get nowadays
Oct 23 2021,positive,villeneuve delivers a truly epic film it needs to seen on the biggest screen possible  its massive world building will leave you wanting more
Oct 23 2021,positive,great story and acting wanting more much like the original star wars back in the day
Oct 23 2021,positive,this movie was one of those rare treasures of science fiction that manages to stay firmly grounded in the source material innovate when needed dazzle you with visually spectacular imagery and round it out with strong writing and inspired acting i think the attention to detail was perhaps what was most impressive even moreso than the immense scale the costume design setting the accuracy and imaginativeness of things like the technology and environment were some of the best ive ever seen in any film      the characters we real and lived in and every actor felt like the perfect casting choice besides the loving amount of detail given to the storytelling the movie managed to handle the enormous scale of the story it was aweinspiring a truly gripping film to experience i felt chills run down my spine when i saw the sandworms burst from the desert landscape like a force of nature the dune film manages to capture the mythical aspects of the original novel and you cant help but become swept up in the grand destiny of paul atreides and his companions i cant believe they pulled it off so masterfully i still am in shock     the first part of the movie spends a good deal of time worldbuilding so there are moments when the story had slower pacing than i expected but even then it is still interesting to watch it all unfold the movie never becomes too bogged down with exposition and the payoff is completely worth it as the film gains momentum they give you just enough to understand and then get back to the essence of the story i was very excited to see this film and walked away so pleased i can see this becoming a franchise on par with the original star wars trilogy or the lord of the rings films yes its that good
Oct 23 2021,positive,great adaptation visually stunning some liberties taken but so many great details 100 worth seeing it in as large a theater as you can really hope part 2 is coming
Oct 23 2021,positive,the best science fiction movie to come out in decades not only visually stunning with decent action though popcorn action fans may have trouble with it not being a huge explosion fest and a very faithful adaptation to the first half of the book  or at least as faithful as you can get with that material
Oct 23 2021,positive,a very beautiful and action packed movie
Oct 23 2021,positive,the first piece of live action to do the books justice it felt like i was watching star wars for the first time the world that was painted was deep and real a true epic sifi the only issue i have is waiting for the next movie 
Oct 23 2021,positive,an instant classic on par to be one of the best movies of year if not decade
Oct 23 2021,positive,wow i dont even know where to start as a diehard fan of the book series i was so nervous for this movie and i have to say  its absolutely perfect somehow villeneuve reached into my mind and ripped the images straight out of my imagination casting them onto the screen its an incredibly faithful adaptation of the book and probably the best book to movie adaptation that ive ever seen there are a few minor things that were changed for the movie and a couple details that were skipped for the sake of time but it all works well in the context just go watch it its spectacular
Oct 23 2021,positive,breathtaking smooth  deep story dune is here  watch on the biggest screen possible
Oct 23 2021,positive,i wasnt disappointed i love the syfy mini series for dune and children of dune cant wait for part 2 i hope they film them consecutively so we can make sure we get the full story the saga of dune continues
Oct 23 2021,positive,this is a great movie i have never read the book but this movie makes me want to go read this movie feels like it need to be a big franchise scifi was definitely missing a film like this
Oct 23 2021,positive,a bit slow but its visual epicness and stellar cast more than makeup for its minor shortcomings
Oct 23 2021,positive,riveting  can be a bit confusing at times because the source material is so deep but it finds its way  the action casting and drama are fantastically shot  well done  cant wait for part two
Oct 23 2021,positive,cinematic immersive amazing cast must see in theatre
Oct 23 2021,positive,my only complaint is that it ended too soon i never read the book and probably saw the 1984 version once years ago which i remember as being confusing and silly i found this plot easy enough to understand the cinematography is beautiful the casting was fantastic with so many recognizable names however the two standouts were actors i wasnt familiar with rebecca ferguson as pauls mom and paul himself timothee chalamet i was mesmerized by both when they were on the screen and they were on screen together a lot cant wait for part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,instant classic everything it should have been originally and more the adaptation from the book is near perfect couldnt ask for a better movie and casting a must see in theaters
Oct 23 2021,positive,true to form with newer modern graphics outstanding
Oct 23 2021,positive,epic lotr scale action and drama must see in theaters
Oct 23 2021,positive,mild spoilers while it doesnt suffer as much from the voiceover exposition of lynchs 1984 version it has its fair share via spoken dialog vs inner dialog the story tracks the same arc and the scenes struck me as similar with the major differences occurring in the pacing  editing in the end i was left with the impression that the major differences were in the selection  editing of the various scenes the tenortone trends toward more emphasis on the religious aspectsparallels with islam than anything else with out spoiling part 2 i hope they cover muadibs rise to emperor and the ensuring battles
Oct 23 2021,positive,i thought it was superb ive heard the complaints about the plotstoryline but i think thats just people being snobbish and knowing that dune adaptations have suffered from those stumbles in the past it made perfect sense to me its an amazing film let it be an amazing film the visuals the music the acting was also superb i might see it again 
Oct 23 2021,positive,read the book so i came into this with high expectations and i was not disappointed this movie was a wild ride and i was here for all of it the score is amazing the cinematography is gorgeous it made me feel like my imagination didnt run wild enough from just reading their direction with this movie was simply stunning the only reason why it lost half a star is because i feel like they chose a weird spot to close the movie i knew this would be a part one so i was thinking of plot points they might have closed the movie off of they didnt choose any of the ones i thought in fact they didnt choose a plot point at all they set everything up in this movie but there was no resolve or problem solvedfixed by the end of this movie it felt like a prequel because of that but i dont hate it i know the og storyline and i love what theyve done so i cant have true negative feelings towards this
Oct 23 2021,positive,never read the book was good not a lot of action but feels like story will be great
Oct 23 2021,positive,this is an awesome movie
Oct 23 2021,positive,it was  a great movie
Oct 23 2021,negative,its a movie fir fanboys only for the rest of usboring af 
Oct 23 2021,negative,i thought this movie needed more chemistry between the characters perhaps witty banter or something that would make me care about the characters a bit more you might like this movie if  action sequences are enough for you ive never seen the original so i cant compare the ending is set up for a sequel which i dont plan on watching
Oct 23 2021,negative,hated it  stupid and boringwanted it to be good 
Oct 23 2021,negative,over dramatic star wars like movie
Oct 23 2021,positive,while it might be difficult for those unfamiliar with the material to adjust to dune is masterfully crafted in every way to create the first part of a sci fi epic that was well worth the wait
Oct 23 2021,negative,movie was slow to build up to its message  not enough action no closure to  a movie every movie you pay for should have some closure even if sequel pending very dissapointed
Oct 23 2021,positive,the cinematography and story line is awesome it is what raised by wolves wants to be has some great actors good story and damn the special effects are great
Oct 23 2021,positive,stunning visually and audibly from beginning to end
Oct 23 2021,positive,amazing film definitely a contender for film of the year every aspect of the movie is phenomenal
Oct 23 2021,positive,i begrudgingly agree with part of dean richards review of dune this improved the vision of the lynch movie but it was more true in execution to the novel still its own baby in all the best ways
Oct 23 2021,positive,great story development cant wait for sequel
Oct 23 2021,positive,honestly one of the better movies i have seen in awhile i was oddly surprised most movies dont live up to hype dune put me in the mind set of star wars mixed with old school fantasy its a must see
Oct 23 2021,positive,this movie will engulf you in a desert plant and leave you wanting more
Oct 23 2021,positive,visually stunning and characters were perfectly cast i could literally stay and watch hours more
Oct 23 2021,positive,this movie started off soo slow did didnt get good until the end
Oct 23 2021,positive,loved it every part
Oct 23 2021,positive,really good balance or science fiction action and suspense
Oct 23 2021,positive,plot too simple but man the visuals are spectacular storyline was hard to follow and zero explanation as to what is going on this will definitely win many oscars
Oct 23 2021,positive,maybe the most epic film ive seen in theatres incredible book to movie adaptation cant wait for part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,soundtrack adherence to the source
Oct 23 2021,positive,so good  when is part ii
Oct 23 2021,positive,obviously only half the movie so disliked otherwise well done scope special effects acting and more modern view
Oct 23 2021,positive,as a gen x who grew up on the alan smithee david lynch removed as director and david lynch version and reading all books i have yo give it 5 star  in reality 325  who only shows the beginning of act 2 and calls it a movie
Oct 23 2021,positive,superbly done great acting and visuals it stays loyal to the book without making the mistakes the 1984 movie made im glad they separated the movie into two parts as it makes this a slow burn that doesnt rush the complex world building required to understand this universe hopefully they greenlight the second half of dune
Oct 23 2021,positive,while this film is only part of the story detailed in a classic and epic novel it establishes quite a bit in its over 2 hour runtime packed with an incredible cast the marketing does not do the film any justice beyond teasing interested parties just enough to get them into theaters or onto their couches the score that accompanies each scene allows the audience to breathe in the events that unfold at a slow but fascinating pace  this film is well worth the cost of admission  i would share details but this is a film that is best left to be experienced
Oct 23 2021,negative,i think you have to read the book to like this movie extremely boring
Oct 23 2021,positive,visually stunning  played up some plot things that made it a better film  cant wait for part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,cinematography was stunning i just didnt know anything about the movie and expected too much out of it
Oct 23 2021,positive,hands down the best booktomovie adaption ive ever seen the acting was superb the faithful adherence to the novel was honestly impressive and i could go on and on about how good the score was cant wait to go see it again
Oct 23 2021,negative,this movie was visually stunning and intense however all of the action and use of pauls powers that has been shown in the trailers are actually visions of the future and not actually in the film in fact almost nothing happens other than the destruction of his people there is no war no major fight scenes and all of the important characters we see are killed off it is a build up to nothing with no actual sequel planned yet this was a major disappointment zendaya a big celeb promoted for the movie was barely in it she makes an actual appearance at the very end again everything that is seen in the trailers is merely pauls visions of the future what a waste of such incredibly talented actors
Oct 23 2021,positive,super well done explains a lot of what the original didnt have time to there are pros and cons to the original compared to this one but overall i think this one has done a better job really looking forward to part 2
Oct 23 2021,negative,the movie is ok i have read the books and saw both the lynch and scifi versions of the move this version has no emotion and there is no atmosphere to it everything is flat there is no story being told its choppy and expects the audience to have read the book to understand arakis is an important part of what is happening and is a character that seems to be overlooked the cast had potential but the dialogue or the lack there of doesnt keep the movie progressing hope part 2 redeems the first half of the movie because the first half is lifeless
Oct 23 2021,negative,no explanation of what was going on the entire time complete drug out and incredibly boring waste of time i cant get back
Oct 23 2021,positive,well made story line was hard to follow
Oct 23 2021,positive,amazing movie  it did move quickly but it captured the feeling of the book pretty well  stilgars accent was very thick and hard to understand but it was still good
Oct 23 2021,positive,good overall but extremely difficult to hear the dialog i wish id waited to watch it at home so i could have turned on the captions
Oct 23 2021,positive,everything i wanted it to be stunning and beautifull
Oct 23 2021,positive,havent been that impressed with a movie since james cameron avatar release in 2009 this saga is in great hands
Oct 23 2021,positive,i loved this movie it is a masterpiece  this visuals are stunning
Oct 23 2021,positive,it does an excellent job of interpreting the book into a movie     i will never do the boise edwards imax again ghostbusters 2016 3d was broken hunger games focus was broken and the made me motion sick and dune was cranked up so loud that half the theater goers had their fingers in their ears 45 minutes later my ears are still ringing    excellent movie terrible imax settings and crew never repeating it
Oct 23 2021,positive,ive dreamed of this movie since reading the book and seeing the original  i could not have imagined being more blown away by the sheer size and scope and the amazing creation of the foundation of this storyline  part 2  directors cut please
Oct 23 2021,positive,read the book before watching the movie
Oct 23 2021,positive,true to the novel mostly the allstar crew helped make it a little deeper than it would have been cant wait for part two
Oct 23 2021,positive,incredible adaptation of frank herberts legendary novel 1010
Oct 23 2021,positive,this movie is amazing audio and visuals are outstanding so hard to tell what is cgi and not very similar to the first lots of slow spots but similar to the first must watch
Oct 23 2021,negative,criminally overrated good visuals and everything but was an incomplete movie im aware that its a setup for a second part and everything but it still felt dragged and anticlimactic regardless not a slow burn just a slow plot to no avail
Oct 23 2021,negative,grand in scope slow in pacing i know most people loved this movie but it was a snore fest for me it took forever for anything to happen did not like this movie will pass on part two
Oct 23 2021,positive,i never post a review on anything first time ever this movie was worth it i had no background knowledge and have never read the books i truly felt like i have just seen the next big seriesstar wars lord of the rings harry potter etc and this i just the beginning
Oct 23 2021,positive,the cinematography was amazing  the film followed the book fairly well
Oct 23 2021,positive,amazing visuals sound design costume design character development and world building
Oct 23 2021,positive,good cast  creative and faithful to the book
Oct 23 2021,positive,characters cinematography story line so good was a bit long and the sound in the theater was so loud and it was very cold in there brrr overall cant wait for part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,loved the cast story telling and visual effects
Oct 23 2021,positive,closer to the book than the 80s version the sound was amazing well done
Oct 23 2021,positive,it really had no satisfying ending leaving everything to be resolved in a sequel that may never come in reality this movie in all its basics could have been given in a flashback
Oct 23 2021,positive,my senses were attacked i had intermittent chills down my body throughout the runtime thanks to the scope of the imax scenes with zimmers score this was cinematic immersion to the highest degree the book was alive in front of my eyes this is a rare theater experience ill write something more coherent after i watch it again but after i heard about this in 2019 i read the book and was anticipating this ever since this whole wait was so worth it
Oct 23 2021,positive,by far the best dune movie that has been made  im so glad that they respected the book by not trying to cram it all into one movieinstead they are staying true to the book and taking the time needed to develop the characters and the story  i saw it on opening dayand am seeing again in 2 days  imax is the only way to see itdont shortchange yourself by watching on a tv or in a regular theatre
Oct 23 2021,positive,vast imposing glorious a story this heroic should not be rushed it should be felt even inferred this is a masterful film  it transfixes you with its subtletyand its grandiosity
Oct 23 2021,positive,everything i dared to hope it would be  ive read the novel more times than i can remember and i never imagined that i would see it brought to life like it was in this film  visuals casting story music just amazing  the unfilmable has been filmed  if part two doesnt get made it will constitute a genuine crime against the art of cinema
Oct 23 2021,positive,beautiful highly recommended very faithful adaptation
Oct 23 2021,positive,waited a long time for this and it was well worth it  stellar cast amazing attention to detail and what a world denis has crafted
Oct 23 2021,positive,an amazing space fantasy that is an awe to see the writing by far the best element of the movie knows what it wants from the story and stays laser focused on that from start to finish there are almost no detours pit stops rabbit holes or distractions from the story that is being told making for one of the most engaging stories from hollywood in the past few years
Oct 23 2021,positive,beautifully shot great cast exciting storyi know its part one but it left me wanting more and not in a bad way
Oct 23 2021,positive,the movie was an experience in imax it was slow and felt like a slow walk through a beautiful park i dont think this movie will be good at home i was sad that they didnt complete it and we will have to wait probably 45 years before part 2
Oct 23 2021,neutral,the soundmusic overpowered the dialogue to often throughout the movie especially when the characters were speaking softly or whispering the actress playing lady jessica played her way to weakly as a bene gesserit she should have played her much stronger and more capable finally the pace of the movie seemed slow at times and this wasnt even the complete movie
Oct 23 2021,positive,an absolute breathtaking science fiction film a blend of star wars and game of thrones helmed by the best director in the business this movie blew me away on a level i wasnt expecting i did have high hopes and this movie surpassed them please please bring on part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,it was better than i thought it would be
Oct 23 2021,negative,disappointing never seen the original or read the books i was lost and bored by the minimal talking and little backstory visuals and sound were immersive which is why i wont go lower but the ratings fooled me so i have to even it out
Oct 23 2021,positive,imax is not worth it when the seats are uncomfortable and you have children behind you kicking your seats that you pay almost 20 dollars per person for    movie was slow but okay
Oct 23 2021,positive,a lot better than the original must see on the big screen
Oct 23 2021,positive,extraordinary in imax the theateres sound was a bit high but nothing to do with the movie amazing cant wait for part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,this is a spectacle that left me wanting more
Oct 23 2021,positive,amazing theatrical experience geeked out from beginning to end
Oct 23 2021,positive,1010 recommend is a long action packed galactic sized science fiction geopolitical action thriller it captures the scale and majesty of frank herberts masterpiece i am thrilled beyond measure that it met my expectations and exceeded them
Oct 23 2021,positive,this is as close to the dune in my mind as when i was reading it and the actors draw you into them with such expertise finally a movie i truly felt was worth my time add 5 more stars to do this justice
Oct 23 2021,negative,a welldone take on the book a very strong example of the peter jackson style of overly long dramatic shots attempting to convey emotion meaning if you wish to be bored by fantastic shots of scifi scenery glacial paced character development and a bland attempt to make things feel big while forgetting the underlying story then this is a wonderful piece if wanting more action and character development benhur with heston is a much more entertaining piece    this is only part 1 of dune by the way
Oct 23 2021,positive,amazing visuals must see it again
Oct 23 2021,positive,grand well executed and acted visual audio masterpiece
Oct 23 2021,negative,this movie was horrible too long and just plain boring complete waste of time 
Oct 23 2021,positive,so much emotion we are the characters not just the lead it is imaginative and thought provoking a perfect movie experience get out of our world and live in dune
Oct 23 2021,positive,incredible  long time dune fan or brand newits amazing
Oct 23 2021,positive,definitely a slow burn but accurate and beautifully shot and acted a
Oct 23 2021,positive,incredible adaptation cant wait for the 2nd part
Oct 23 2021,positive,absolutely beautiful
Oct 23 2021,positive,just finished the 2021 dune movie    was absolutely not disappointed even one drop of water     fanfuggintastic    as of friday 22oct2021 thereve been rumblings that dune part two has been green lit but no official word has been given im really looking forward to seeing how they bring the rest of this to fruition    yup infuggincredible    it ended exactly when i had expected the cutoff to be    some points from the book were glossed over andor omitted but nothing i would dock this cinematic masterpiece for    i give it a fat loogy spit and a full 7 out of 5 stars    it was so fuggin good
Oct 23 2021,positive,as visually amazing as i had hoped the story is definitely a little confusing but compared to lynchs not at all and thats only because ive never read the book for people who have read the book im sure this is quite a treat for people like me its something that ill need to see multiple times to catch everything plotwise but that wont be a problem because i enjoyed a lot of this and denis is just an incredible filmmaker who has so much focus and attention on the craft from the visual details to the story intricacies
Oct 23 2021,positive,and here we have the most anticipated film ever its a film about politics drama and scifi done with an audiovisual proposal colossal and unparalleled indeed this film isnt indifferent to the action scenes theyre subtle also massive every single shot converges with the sets to create a new multisensory experience around all the film all the performances were great and unforgettable the script is very good but treating of a first part the film abruptly ends the scifi isnt far to the past films of denis villeneuve arrival and blade runner 2049 but with dune instead to stay in his comfort zone go a step up adapting the most unadaptable film i cant wait for the next step in this new franchise
Oct 23 2021,positive,engulfs you in a new universe music was a little overbearing though
Oct 23 2021,positive,im probably one of the smaller group of people who loved the 1984 version when it came out as a kid and watched it again last month and appreciated it as much i think this one was a little more stiff the acting than the 84 version but i havent read the bookperhaps lynchs was a little more lively than the book  i hopepray they let dv finish this  if you liked lynchs version you should really like this
Oct 23 2021,positive,boasting a starstudded cast dazzling visual effects and plenty of ambition dune not only improves upon the 1984 david lynch film but also offers a wellcrafted and thoughtprovoking scifi epic on its own merits that will likely leave fans of the classic frank herbert novel as well as fans of the genre as a whole clammoring for a sequel
Oct 23 2021,positive,breathtaking perfection immaculately crafted villeneuve with yet another achievement so many filmmakers strive to accomplish once 
Oct 23 2021,positive,been waiting 50 years for this movie   this is dune
Oct 23 2021,positive,it was a great movie and the acting was perfect
Oct 23 2021,negative,it was boring dull and pretentious it was more concerned with landscapes scale and musical scores than having a narrative with welldeveloped characters
Oct 23 2021,positive,excellent movie very true to the book
Oct 23 2021,positive,long awaited and much appreciated  intelligence may be required think science then expand your mind to include all thats possible and then some  read the books  be excited and thankful
Oct 23 2021,positive,loved it very intricate world building and characters sets the stage for a fantastic saga
Oct 23 2021,positive,true to the book well paced my only complaint is that it was too beige
Oct 23 2021,positive,loved it its very hard turn a book with five sequels into a cohesive movie without confusing cliffhangers that said  i thought denis villeneuve did an outstanding job props to set design  costume  cinematography  outstanding  and a superb cast doesnt hurt either a must see
Oct 23 2021,positive,definitive version of dune on film lynch movie lacked too much from book or took book concepts and changed them into something different like weirding modules and sound weapons to replace a  pranabindu physical and psychological training and the miniseries was low budget trash with ridiculous costumes that looked like they were made from felt and construction paper the guild were weird and ridiculous making sill hand gestures and head tilts but the new film had elements never explored before like the bene gesserit hand signals with subtitles real ornithopters paul and jessica in the still tent the cone of silence used by house harkonnen to discuss plans in secret jessica used her legs in combat and was more weirding than any previous version and the spice economy and importance of leto maintaining it was stressed i wouldnt trust people who say they didnt like it that have read the book if they told me milk was white and if people didnt like it and never read the book then learn to read or go watch football your opinion is irrelevant here and the movie wasnt made with you in mind
Oct 23 2021,positive,if you like world building this is a very good movie  if you dont its not  most of the negative reviews are focused on the dense plot but anyone who can follow lotr or got can easily follow this  i enjoyed those parts quite a bit was actually a little disappointed in the action scenes feeling they were too simplistic but the lead playing paul astreides is fantastic great visuals great sound good villains   worth seeing
Oct 23 2021,positive,this movie was great 
Oct 23 2021,positive,to interpret a book then convey in a limited time frame is not an easy task give this series time to breathe more movies please
Oct 23 2021,positive,visually incredible excellent casting timothee chalamet is so good you will stop hating him if you did keep in mind the movie only covers the first half of the novel so youll have to wait for the sequel
Oct 23 2021,positive,incredible movie acting directing and cinematography all transcend normal movies watch it on the biggest screen as soon as possible
Oct 23 2021,positive,while it certainly isnt the greatest film ever made it may very well be the most visually impressive and most interesting one youve seen in years
Oct 23 2021,neutral,great cgi but there were many parts where the story dragged on too long
Oct 23 2021,negative,long and kinda boring never read the books but really hard to get into the story
Oct 23 2021,positive,visually and aurally stunning and very faithful to the book heres hoping for part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,best remake ive ever seen and maybe the best movie ive ever watched beautiful cinematography and acting cant wait for part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,a great movie a crossover between game of thrones and start wars i will read the books
Oct 23 2021,positive,the acting in this movie is really phenomenal its so good that im thinking of reading the books definitely a must see
Oct 23 2021,positive,absolutely incredible aweinspiring visuals make this film a delight i hope that a sequel can be made
Oct 23 2021,neutral,its so slow and a complex back story that drags on and on
Oct 23 2021,positive,amazing effects amazing sound track amazing acting one of the best movies ive seen in this past decade
Oct 23 2021,positive,just so entertaining and interesting
Oct 23 2021,positive,the movie was long but it did an amazing job of making me feel like i was in that universe this was even more apparent seeing the movie in imax
Oct 23 2021,positive,stunning absolutely satisfying to me as a longtime fan of the dune novels
Oct 23 2021,positive,excellent it didnt seem like a 2 12 hours please give us part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,great special effects  painfully slow at timeswhich made the 25 hours seem extra long im looking forward to the next one
Oct 23 2021,positive,great cinematography ok soundtrack but not memorable some parts of the dialog were very difficult to hear the film was to long could have used some more action sequences
Oct 23 2021,positive,loved it perfect cast i cant wait for part 2 and i hope all the books are made into movie
Oct 23 2021,positive,this was absolutely insane holy
Oct 23 2021,neutral,it looks gorgeous its also so so boring
Oct 23 2021,positive,visually stunning this is a great work of science fiction filmmaking the book will always be different then the film the directors vision was in line with the spirit of the book too few flaws to complain about the crime is they have not started on the second part of the story  all about the money 
Oct 23 2021,neutral,in creating a film epic there has to be something epic about it in order to qualify for that designation unfortunately this latest remake of frank herberts dune fails on that point on so many fronts while the special effects and cinematography are indeed dazzling and the film can justifiably lay claim to yet another outstanding hans zimmer score theres not much else here to grab viewer attention or evoke an emotional response a big part of that has to do with the films overlong unengaging narrative much of which is a long cold boring snooze and often tediously derivative in its vision not to mention inherently and obviously incomplete there are also casting issues aplenty with some performers like timothee chalamet and rebecca ferguson being placed into roles for which theyre wholly unsuited and with others such as josh brolin javier bardem and charlotte rampling being woefully underused this is an uncharacteristically underwhelming effort from director denis villeneuve a filmmaker best known for stellar work on pictures like arrival 2016 and blade runner 2049 2017 regrettably this is yet another example of a muchanticipated offering that falls flat and comes nowhere close to living up to its potential
Oct 23 2021,positive,it has taken my entire lifetime to make a solid adaptation of dune thank you denis and everyone involved
Oct 23 2021,positive,its a lot to process but its still a very good movie the writing the acting the visuals costumes and cinematography was all well done
Oct 23 2021,positive,a wonderfully made adaptation to a story that was believed to be unfilmable the cinematography special effects and score alone are worth the time in an imax theatre the acting was spot on as well loved it
Oct 23 2021,positive,awesomeness love everything about this movie dune is like an artful audiovisual feast i want to say this is one of the best science fiction movies i have seen this year 
Oct 23 2021,positive,very good true to book
Oct 23 2021,positive,innovative couldve cut out a bit to make it shorter but it keeps your interest
Oct 23 2021,positive,you need to read the book first
Oct 23 2021,positive,dune part one is excellent the theatre was clean as well i highly recommend it
Oct 23 2021,positive,best movie of the year
Oct 23 2021,positive,overly dramatic which is why i would go to the movies
Oct 23 2021,positive,the plot was 610 as it was hard to understand at times the casting was 910 visual effects 1010 music 910 and cinematography 910 great film but the plot being confusing was a bugger my personal interest level is at a 310 
Oct 23 2021,positive,exceptional film  a big film for a big story
Oct 23 2021,positive,wow  go see dune  in a theater    get vaccinated  wear a mask  wear a space suit if you have to    but go see it with the big screen and the incredible sound system imax if you can swing it    it is beautiful it is thrilling and it is fun
Oct 23 2021,positive,spectacular visuals and true to the story but a bit slow moving and ended prematurely  left for a sequel or trilogy maybe
Oct 23 2021,positive,lots of sand enjoyable acting i like popcorn so i will see part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,wow hands down best cgi of the year visually stunning better than the original obviously because of the amazing cgi i grew up with the original and saw it in the theater for this remake i do think they could have explained things better i feel like people who dont know the story or have no clue what dune is about will be completely lost in the beginning the movie was so long almost three hours yet they did not explain the little things
Oct 23 2021,negative,this a very long and very slow movie hopefully it will be worth it after part 2
Oct 23 2021,negative,that was the worst movie i had ever seen i  waited years to see this and it was so boring and pointless wish i could get my money back
Oct 23 2021,positive,awesome movie  much better than the original
Oct 23 2021,positive,i watched this movie at my fiancés request but i was into it pretty quick and absolutely hooked not far in by the end i was thinking this is my star wars i have never been invested in a franchise lol the movie was awesome and really feels like just the first act of a great story so i hope to see the next one sooner than later definitely recommend
Oct 23 2021,positive,review from a huge scifi fan who hasnt read the books and failed to get through lynchs film on 2 attempts    1010 i have no words that would do it justice this is easily one of the greatest scifi movies ever made just the visuals and the sound design alone were breathtaking and left me stunned     i cant say enough about the cast everybody was giving some of their best performances but i thought that josh brolin especially was a standout in his smaller role his scene with timothée where they are training at the beginning of the film was one of my favorites    it was very fun to watch i know that i had a stupid grin on my face almost the entire time but i didnt even care if anything has ever been worth the wait this movie was it    im so glad that i was able to see it in theaters because it was truly made for the biggest screen and best sound system that said i cant wait to rewatch it on hbo max tomorrow    thank you denis
Oct 23 2021,positive,dune both builds a tangible world and tells a gripping tale in part one the sound and visuals are a delight and create and ambiance that encourages total immersion in the world
Oct 23 2021,negative,90 crap dont bother if you have any passion for the books or david lynchs film i would have walked out 8 minutes in if i hadnt had my daughter with me the dialogue is atrocious the script writers must be 17 years old and have never read the books or maybe any book  denis villeneuve has a flavor and it is bad i liked blade runner 2049 but now that ive seen this steaming pile i dislike both equally the man has one vision and tapes it over every story yuck
Oct 23 2021,positive,a stellar soundtrack and some interesting world building props up dune its a good slow burn that gets a bit too slow isaac momoa  skarsgards are great timothée chalamet is kinda boring but hot my god that hair some cgi is great some isnt hopefully we get a part 2
Oct 23 2021,negative,movie was slow as molasses going uphill on a winter day
Oct 23 2021,positive,very faithful to the book stunning cinematography
Oct 23 2021,neutral,should have stuck to the book more and not changed things that didnt need to be changed like the carryall scene also the internal monologue in the book needed to be done in it as it conveys so much more than this movie did
Oct 23 2021,positive,see this in the theater ye i was born looong after the book was written but i read it for the first time in high school snd ive always considered it amongst the best this movie is a sprawling epic nothing short of lotr only caveat is that the sequel hasnt been approved yet hopefully this does good enough to merit a followup cause without giving anything away the movie only tells about 13 of the story in the novel ie it kinda ends just as its getting going thats not to say this isnt terrific story telling the visuals audio and score are outstanding the movie doesnt have that forced cheesy humor synonymous with marvel or star wars its dark emotional and deep but its also wrought with epic and intimate battle scenes world building and suspense cant recommend this masterpiece enough but you gotta see it on the big screen 
Oct 23 2021,positive,well acted decent script but there are some extraneous scenes that could have been trimmed or cut entirely it felt like the director was trying to draw things out which he was of course too many visions of chani too many long shots saying look at this isnt it pretty    the entire scene on the imperial army planet was unnecessary and could have been done with some simple conversational exposition but we had to have something for piter to do didnt we we removed most of his presence with the baron to make room for eating disgustingly or sitting disgustingly in a steam room in a awkward looking fat suit    definitely a beginning doesnt feel like a completely film we will have to see if the sequels play out and make this worth it
Oct 23 2021,positive,loved loved this movie great casting  i will definitely be seeing this again especially so that i can hear the whispers better
Oct 23 2021,positive,best movie ive seen in the last 10 years
Oct 23 2021,positive,an absolute spectacle very fresh cinema that exists in its own universe need more
Oct 23 2021,positive,good epic movie  nice set up for a trilogy script was good  executed very well  dont have much to complain about
Oct 23 2021,negative,slow motion torture  takes forever for the story to unfold
Oct 23 2021,positive,this is a decent adaptation and if you enjoyed blade runner 2049 then you will be entertained by this movie as well obviously this adaptation will become a series of movies and we can only pray that it does not follow the path of star wars and the halloween reboot    in my opinion its worth seeing in imax and possibly a second viewing on discount day if you dont mind the longer runtime
Oct 23 2021,positive,so good great production quality great acting really well done
Oct 23 2021,positive,i was very excited about this long time dune fan the trailers were fantastic and the casting seemed great the actual movie though was just okay it looked great but the character development wasnt there for people who dont already know them for dune fans its great for the firsttime viewer it was boring scenes were very drawn out and could have been used for more character and plot development instead of some passing dialogue there was very little action the main character was the ornithopter it got the most screen time im a bit underwhelmed
Oct 23 2021,positive,the colors the acting and the music are amazing
Oct 23 2021,positive,wow its been a while i cant recall the last time i saw this level of epic on the big screen dune 2021 is a audiovisual treat for start to end if you let the film take you into its world which is not hard to do you will be transported into the amazing world denis villeneuve has crafted in world where most new releases are sequels or cookiecutter efforts its refreshing to get a film where such effort and craftmanship is visible on every frame    if you can venture to see this film in a theater specifically imax it will be well regarded no home has the smart tv or surround sound system to do this film justice
Oct 23 2021,positive,movie was well done however it felt as if it was only made to set up another one it lacked in plot and action
Oct 23 2021,negative,full of action and high budget wizardry but boring at its core
Oct 23 2021,positive,incredible to see this classic novel from my childhood come to life on the big screen its everything i hoped for and more
Oct 23 2021,positive,a very true adaptation of the book looking forward to part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,great movie phenomenal acting by timothée chalamet would have loved for zendaya to have more screen time music they used goes great with the scenes and i liked the build ups they did for the suspenseful scenes this movie really reminds me of star wars for some reason
Oct 23 2021,positive,im surprised some critics harshly reviewed it im not seeing it i thought it was done wonderfullygranted im going into this having no dune background whatsoever but this is by far one of the best movies ive seen in a long time 
Oct 23 2021,positive,they took twice the time to tell half the story its visually stunning perfectly casted and scored but why did they have to drag it like this there is no shame in making a single film adaptation i just didnt see what i came to see because they cut the film in half and now im going to have to wait a long time for the actual film i wanted to see the last half when it gets really interesting oh well
Oct 23 2021,positive,phenomenal cast story telling and world building i thoroughly enjoyed this film my biggest complaint is that it isnt a stand alone film theres not really an ending impatiently awaiting a sequel
Oct 23 2021,positive,amazing enjoyable story and cinematography was on point
Oct 23 2021,negative,this movie gets high marks for quality of filming and cgi but i found this movie to be lacking of any emotional ties i get from a movie i was hoping for luke skywalker dark invader any one even obi wan kenobi to show up its a beautiful film but i could barely sit thru it maybe all the characters just didnt mesh oh if you see it in 3d like i did sit in center seats at the angle the scenes become cloudy and barely 3d so i moved my seat  half way thru all much better  avatar is in its own 3d universe  every scene in avatar was perfect 3d no matter where you sat i presume there are scenes from its next part as when the opening came on it said dune   under that  part 1    people were sitting around when the credits were rolling so i figured there was a trailer coming didnt care enjoy
Oct 23 2021,positive,the cinematography is spectacular acting is believable  im very happy that were getting two movies that will actually tell the story of dune with more detail and provide a better understanding compared to the original im very excited and  looking forward with great anticipation to the second half of dune
Oct 23 2021,positive,it is a very slow telling story but good im just happy that i have hbomax because i would have been very disappointed going to the theater and paying for it 
Oct 23 2021,positive,spoiler free    i saw this in imax which i feel would be doing a disservice to the movie by watching it in a regular format    a feast for the eyes and such a rich world the characters are developed likeable and the movie is truer to the book if i may be bold frank herbert would have given this movie a full and beaming endorsement it does not diminish lynchs work but is a sweeping evolution of everything it could have been the best approximation is that the original dune was a piece of a chocolate bar great but you were left wanting something this version is like a snickers hits in all the right ways with a complex melange of flavors    go go all of you venture forth safely and watch dune in theaters
Oct 23 2021,positive,just ended no real ending zendaya in it for 5 minutes at the end
Oct 23 2021,positive,stunningly beautiful chalamet is strong its an easier entry point for not dune readers but as a reader i found it still incredibly entertaining great movie
Oct 23 2021,positive,timothy chalamet nails it the film is big and beautiful and dark and grainy in all the right places well worth a trip to the theater do yourself a favor and see it in imax
Oct 23 2021,positive,pacing is a little slow to begin with but once it gets going it is nonstop action beautifully shot and leaves a lot of intrigue for a sequel
Oct 23 2021,positive,epic is the best word to describe
Oct 23 2021,positive,great movie highly recommend it
Oct 23 2021,positive,nails it the scope the space ships the knife battles  all excellent like empire and rings  looks cool sounds great and everyone is beautiful i vote yes for part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,a visual masterpiece in every regard just beautifully cinematic  watch it on a huge movie screen if you can some small dialogue soundaudibility issues but they are dwarfed by a gigantic list of achievements
Oct 23 2021,positive,the scifi epic of the decade  go see it on the big screen as it was meant to be seen
Oct 23 2021,positive,fantastic scifi epic great acting score visuals and cinematography also very cool storyline
Oct 23 2021,positive,did book justice people who didnt read the book may get a bit confused bc so much to take in but still impressed by some really amazing scenes
Oct 23 2021,positive,fantastic visuals and an amazing score along with great actors playing their roles very well everything i could have hoped for
Oct 23 2021,positive,this is a huge epic movie i have read the book and watched all the other versions and understand why they struggle  this envisioning is by far the best i could have hoped for  the scenes are huge and characters many but they did well the casting was very good on all characters even if bautista and momoa stand out as overtly huge humanoids  the portrayal of the various cultures including clothing ships buildings décor art tech etc was a huge task that someone should be rewarded for it is incredible my only complaints are small the crysknife should only be 20cm long so it is easily concealed  also i think the lady jessica was played as too weak emotional and unsure of herself compared to what i got from the book she could have been a bit more like the bbc version  lastly i simply do not understand why anyone would make the decision to wait to see how this movie did before making part 2  thats a terrible decision  its easier and cheaper to just use the sets and people and make both parts like lotr and others have done too many things can go wrong if you wait for years i just dont get it
Oct 23 2021,positive,goes perfectly by the book   hoping for a part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,epically spectacular 
Oct 23 2021,positive,this is the dune ive been waiting for  absolutely mesmerizing cant wait for part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,hands down one of the best movies i have ever seen absolute masterpiece
Oct 23 2021,positive,the movie was very slow and drawn out  expected more action based on preview and trailer i saw
Oct 23 2021,positive,go see it now its amazing
Oct 23 2021,positive,its a part one of a part two so its more so shaping the world but its still really good
Oct 23 2021,positive,the visual effects and music were amazing the plot left me with more questions than answers it makes me want to read the book now
Oct 23 2021,positive,wow this film is stunning just see it in a movie theatre please so we can get part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,better than we expected special effects top notch cant wait for the sequel next year
Oct 23 2021,positive,beautiful portrayal of a much beloved classic i wept very much hoping for a sequel
Oct 23 2021,positive,great cinematography and great music a very gradual buildup makes up the entire movie still worth seeing for scifi fans
Oct 23 2021,positive,true to the book  visually stunning incredible cast excellent acting amazing tech
Oct 23 2021,positive,i loved this film the david lynch version no longer exists for me please wb start filming part 2 right now
Oct 23 2021,positive,the movie was breathtaking and enjoyed watching it
Oct 23 2021,positive,this made me think about how i liked arrival but i now prefer dune for the approach taken that is like arrival but with a lot of epic science fiction scenes
Oct 23 2021,positive,absolutely wonderful
Oct 23 2021,positive,close to the book well casted and great music score this is one movie that really deserves viewing on the big screen one comment is the dialogue was hard to hear at times  see it to see what inspired parts of star wars and imperial domination themes of avatar better than the previous movie version well done
Oct 23 2021,positive,brilliant performances spectacular action sequences real sense of risk throughout the film the cinematography and the score pulled me straight into the world i cant wait for part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,this movie is one of the best ive seen in ages the magnitude of this movie is amazing the acting is phenomenal the effects are the modern day equivalent of avatars groundbreaking cinematic experience this is the next generations lord of the rings this isnt a movie it is an emotional experience that is only cheapened by the fact that i want part 2 now
Oct 23 2021,positive,it was very slow the first hour liked last hour special effects way better than the first movie from the 1980 didnt like how long it was like all the actors
Oct 23 2021,positive,all i wanted was for it to be true to the book and to tell the whole story 10 out of 10 and despite knowing every single thing that happens after reading the book 30 times i was on the edge of my seat for the last hour of the movie this movie is epic and id bet my bottom dollar that this will be a three movie franchise not 2 this movie only covered about the first third of the book give me more more more  visually stunning music that yanked us everywhere and timothy chalamet bring paul to life if i had to give it one criticism id say not enough context on the bene gesserit considering how foundational they are to the fabric of the story maybe that will shore up in the next installment
Oct 23 2021,positive,well acted great cast superb cinematography and well told story epic cant wait for the next one
Oct 23 2021,positive,this dune adaptation came close to original storyline looking forward to part two
Oct 23 2021,positive,if you are not familiar with the dune saga you will not understand this movie at all  effects are good though
Oct 23 2021,positive,absolutely epic the visuals the story the acting loved it all and cant wait for part two
Oct 23 2021,positive,loved this movie it is clearly made by people that are fans of the novels some things are very quickly glossed over and new fans to the series were left with lots of questions in our group but this movie is incredible and keeps everything important in part one we need need a part two     some small things are ignored shadeout mapes doesnt bloody her knife before sheathing and mentats are not at all explained
Oct 23 2021,positive,wasnt able to go in theaters yet but really looking forward to seeing in imax soon
Oct 23 2021,positive,best theaterstreaming movie of the year
Oct 23 2021,positive,loved every second of this movie  all of the actors did awesome with their roles  loved the worlds that were created and i am very excited for the dune future  hans killed the score was hype for the bagpipes during atreides  been talking about this movie for 24 hours with my friends  watching again tonight  overall gave it a 95100  go see for yourself
Oct 23 2021,positive,i thought this was a movie i was waiting 3 years to see but having seen it on the big screen i realized it was the movie id been waiting 37 years to see thank you denis villenuve and all the cast and crew 
Oct 23 2021,positive,this is the dune  no other dune matters  it makes star wars feel like a preschool tryout  the movie is a slow build but worth it  there are so many commentaries frank herbert is making that you have to be a sophisticated patience audience to really appreciate this movie  this is not some shootem up bang bang action move  if that is what you are looking for then you will be disappointed  this is true scifi
Oct 23 2021,positive,score was overbearing and melodramatic at times  like a lot of movies now
Oct 23 2021,positive,excellent translation of franks work to the big screen
Oct 23 2021,positive,the director did not strain our limits of disbelief looking forward to part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,best 3 hours ever cant wait for sequel
Oct 23 2021,positive,likes set up the next movie well cgi was great story was good  dislikes way too longcould have condensed part not have been so drawn out bag pipes in 8000 years wth lol
Oct 23 2021,positive,not to spoil   but part 2 is a must
Oct 23 2021,positive,this movie really makes viewers excited to see what villenueve will do with a potential dune franchise the writing acting and costumes all do the book justice that previous adaptations have failed to do so far
Oct 23 2021,positive,great movie all round cant wait for part two
Oct 23 2021,positive,i liked it  maybe a little bit slow but as good as the book 
Oct 23 2021,positive,i think this is probably pretty good if you have read the books without reading the books you will be in the dark to whats going on for the most part also it was strangely laid out and had an anticlimactic ending probably due to cutting the book in half 
Oct 23 2021,positive,didnt like the fact that they did not take it to a complete ending guess well have to wait for the sequel
Oct 23 2021,positive,finally the adaptation weve all been waiting for the only but very real problem is that this is only half the story and it leaves the viewer sorely needing the second half its going to be a rough couple of years
Oct 23 2021,positive,amazing direction music and acting
Oct 23 2021,positive,an impeccable adaptation exciting spectacular and emotionally resonant villeneuve once again checks every box every shot is dense with information for those with eyes to see
Oct 23 2021,positive,parts of the movie reminded me of the previous movie  it had my full attention the entire time most movies dont do that for me
Oct 23 2021,positive,they did a nice job with not trying to move to fast and telling the story
Oct 23 2021,positive,absolutely outstanding cant wait for part 2 denis definitely put his all into this hans zimmer created a masterpiece of a soundtrack all the actors did amazing chalamet was incredible go see it if you havent 
Oct 23 2021,negative,too long for no reason and for there to be no real ending
Oct 23 2021,neutral,went in with no knowledge so was probably doomed from the start visually stunning but thought the story was mostly boring and dragged 
Oct 23 2021,positive,great special effect
Oct 23 2021,neutral,long on movie and short on story some of the acting was rather off like they are so happy to see each other when its only been a few weeks not believable mostly special effects felt i was set up to see sequels without having seen enough of a story in the first movie almost left  through having loud effects doesnt make it better it just makes it loud
Oct 23 2021,positive,this was ambitious and the result feels epic the cinematography is beautiful and the character development is good  this will leave you wanting part 2 right now
Oct 23 2021,positive,not a dull moment 2 12 hours flew by
Oct 23 2021,negative,this movie is absolutely horrible dont waste your time or money watching it i walked out of the movie after the first 25 minutes nothing about it made sense the only good thing about this movie is all the stars however this movie seems like an insult to these otherwise amazing performers this is quite possibly the most boring and confusing movie i have watched i had never even heard of the dune franchise until this movie was released i understand this movie is based off a novel that had other film adaptations but this movie does nothing to help first timers understand the concept they jump right into a story and start talking about things like people should already know them for a film doing a reboot on the story you would think that they would give a better introduction to keep audiences engaged they dont the fact that this movie is so long but doesnt have a proper introduction is ridiculous most movies even ones based on novels inform the watcher what is going on all said the stars could not safe this film from being a confusing mess also it is funny because villeneuve made a claim that movies in the marvel cinematic universe are not cinema even tho they make billions of dollars and there are many movies but it makes no sense why he would say this because this movie is clearly not cinema it is a jumbled mess of story with only the face of talented actors to try to save it do not waste your money on this boring film especially since it is apparently supposed to have multiple parts if it manages to even succeed in the box office given its horrible story 
Oct 23 2021,positive,best movie of the decade
Oct 23 2021,negative,disappointed toward the end of the movie that it did not include scenes from the original riding the worms baron couldve been more wicked looking as in the original
Oct 23 2021,positive,its dune best sci fi novel of the past century and despite the temptation they didnt do some fan fiction crap to it if you like sci fi watch this maybe read the book first or at least the first half to understand the movie more
Oct 23 2021,positive,this is a masterpiece reminds me in so many ways of fellowship of the ring in it being an epic and perfect first part of something much greater
Oct 23 2021,positive,definitely big screen material a nice evolution in storytelling from the original movie if only they could do away with all the dream sequences
Oct 23 2021,positive,can one really review a moment this movie needs to be experienced first in the theaters and then again and again
Oct 23 2021,positive,dune is by far the best imax movie experience and this version 2021 of dune is absolutely epic scifi film since star wars and the visual effects are absolutely outstanding and the sound effects and cinematography and costume designer are really incredible and unique and hans zimmer score is absolutely magnificent and hans zimmer should be nominated and win hes award
Oct 23 2021,positive,loved it cant wait for part 2  helps if you read the books
Oct 23 2021,positive,great cinematography slow buildup but it works with a story of this length that needs to be cut in 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,some of the background details were left out like who the houses were the political background etc
Oct 23 2021,positive,stuck with the book and took its time cinematography was amazing
Oct 23 2021,positive,ive seen every iteration of dune thats been developed and read the whole sagathrice i am incredibly thrilled to say denis absolutely stuck the landing it is big loud and most of alla mostly true visualization of frank herberts work kudos
Oct 23 2021,negative,boring and understand anything anybody is saying background noise is too load scenes jump around too much way too artistic and not entertaining
Oct 23 2021,positive,this movie was exceptional  unique and novel plot great fight scenes terrific cast well produced  cant wait for more
Oct 23 2021,positive,great translation of the book best version of dune on the big or small screen to date visually epic great casting excited to see part 2 they better make it my only complaint is the story still felt rushed would have liked to see the political and bene geserit side fleshed out a bit more rather than using one or two sentences to attempt to summarize the reasoning behind actions you see taking place the harkonnens were almost merely a plot advancement tool rather than the brutal malicious force they were in the books hopefully this can be clarified in the second part to bring beast rabban into his full potential that aside this is still the translation ive been waiting for since i first read the books decades ago
Oct 23 2021,positive,breathtakingly huge and well translated to the screen bring on part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,beautiful visuals amazing sound incredible effects exceptional acting i am usually very cynical and nitpick movies even when i love them but i dont have much bad to say about this one it was just a big bold epic movie and i cant wait for part two
Oct 23 2021,positive,yaaas compared to this the 1984 version looks like an snl skit
Oct 23 2021,positive,a tragedy of epic proportions in a gorgeous sci fi setting beautifully shot well developed characters and relationships between them and action scenes out of this world a must see if you want to witness this generations next scifi epic that will be in the history books for sure
Oct 23 2021,positive,one of the best films ive ever seen star wars got lord of the rungs etc have been beaten
Oct 23 2021,positive,great story and acting realistic cinematography  looking forward to part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,absolutely transcendent in every way timothee chalamet is finally going to be known on a wide scale zimmer has elevated the art form and villeneuve has once again accomplished the impossible by adapting the unadaptable well strongly recommend
Oct 23 2021,positive,easily the best dune adaption so far low bar i know an excellent job of translating the feel of the book to the screen although some things were cut for time the flavor remains and what is there was awesome
Oct 23 2021,positive,a very faithful rendering of the original book the tone and texture were exactly what i was hoping for paul was soulful and heroic at the same time specialeffects were great but did not overwhelm the character dynamics or the story arc cant wait for part two
Oct 23 2021,negative,dune was everything advertised  wellmounted exquisitely designed a feast for the eyes and ears  and didnt enjoy a minute of it there and seemingly dozens of characters some with no more than a few minutes of screen time in total many of which do not get the dignity of a name of those characters few are interesting and paul the titular hero and designated white savior at least based on what happens in the novel is the dullest character of all i still dont know quite what motivates him  or whether he actually has any goals in life    perhaps the derided david lynch film from 1984 was the better interpretation of the novel lynch made a conscious decision to frame his shots in vibrant color even to and past the point of being gaudy by contrast the new film could have been shot in black  white with few notable differences lynch looked at the source material and saw camp and turned all the dials up to eleven while the new film has hardly and life at all    perhaps the main problem is that this is not the dune film we need  if we need a dune film at all
Oct 23 2021,positive,they recommended seeing it in imax and they certainly werent kidding what an experience and rarely is it such a cinema experience denis villeneuve get to making part 2 baby
Oct 23 2021,positive,awesome cant wait for part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,hope we get to see the second half
Oct 23 2021,positive,an incredible movie with an amazing story and even better visuals the acting from the star studded cast is excellent as well this movie is great ive seen it 2 times already less than 24 hours after it came out despite it having a 2 and a half hour long runtime i highly suggest you check it out cant wait for part 2 might be the best sequel to any movie ever
Oct 23 2021,positive,this was the version of dune ive been waiting for since i read the book  years  ago bravo
Oct 23 2021,negative,sorry this was just not very good
Oct 23 2021,positive,this movie was incredible i watched with no prior knowledge of the books and was amazed the characters sound it was a very cool cinematic experience im just upset i have to wait for part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,absolutely incredible  beware tho this is part 1 so there will be a lot of questions unanswered as it ends at a crucial turning point in the book no spoilers from me tho lol    go see it at the biggest imax screen possible cannot wait for part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,a slow moving movie but worth every minute excellent performances the best movie ive seen so far this year
Oct 23 2021,neutral,i found this movie incredibly dull both visually the grade mostly and narratively once jason momas character died i slowly slipped into a boredom induced coma wasnt awful the score was amazing but i wouldnt recommend it compared with blade runner 2049 and arrival it was blah also couldnt get past the lead character 8000 years in the future looking like edward scissor hands and being called paul
Oct 23 2021,negative,the worst movie this year i was looking forward to this movie all year for the biggest let down of my life
Oct 23 2021,negative,other than visuals there were only minor improvements over the 1984 adaptation with it following in line what felt like 98 of the time but with more filler in each scene along with detractors that were made worse than the original 1984 release the woke overtones thrown in didnt help it and the to be continued ending was just a slap in the face that just doesnt make sense since the run time for this first half is actually longer than the entire 1984 release and its been proven 3 hour films do just fine they could have cut the fluff and made this a single movie that improved in all aspects it feels weird saying the 1984 release was a superior movie considering how much it lacked itself and how campy it was but it was what i grew up watching and it was much more memorable so with no significant improvements other than really the updated cgi and a delayed release made it not worth waiting for and now im even less excited that there needs to be a conclusion to wait for
Oct 23 2021,positive,very confusing but super good
Oct 23 2021,positive,wonderful best movie of the year
Oct 23 2021,positive,like all dune movies there were differences from the book and other movies but this version is by far the best
Oct 23 2021,positive,excellent character development special effects were exceptional for a 2 12 hour filmit went by so quickly my husband and i are looking forward to part 2 asap
Oct 23 2021,positive,so visually appealing unlike the first dune this movie gives you connection to the characters one of the best movies i have ever seen hands down
Oct 23 2021,positive,best scifi movie of the year true to the books
Oct 23 2021,positive,dune 2021 is pretty awesome for a movie without an ending warner media made a big mistake in not allowing villeneuve to film his epic in one go ala peter jacksons lord on the rings trilogy there is not enough filming done to put out a sequel next year so principle filiming on a followup film cannot commence until 2022 so it will be late 2023 before can get the payoff of an intriguing setup but i get ahead of myself  the world of viewers will be split dune fans love denis villeneuves new version motion picture critics and hollywood types are  likely to laud the film for all the things it gets right i think the rest of masses might not get what the big deal is about  because there is no payoff    i understand the pacing of the film with all its time spent on timothee chalomet closeups the simple fact is i wanted more that is better than wanting less but it is now so frustrating knowing that the more is so far in the future
Oct 23 2021,positive,great cinematography atmosphere effects cast and music  does a better job of fleshing out the story than dune 1984 but the story still feels a little cramped for time even with twice the running length including the assumed sequel
Oct 23 2021,positive,ive only watched villeneuves dune on hbo max so i will likely add to this once i make it to the one and only imax screen in my city though i will see it on a regular large screen as well because this film is so beautifully made that it demands repeated viewings in the cinema as even on my 40  inch hd tv screen it clearly isnt sufficient enough due to the scope and scale of such immense and precise cinematography     this a very narratively muted even austere regarding the dialogue yet visually majestic and glorious and somehow believable story regarding the technology planetary environments how humans interact with each other regardless of it being 8000 years in the future people remain people after all after diving into herberts novel numerous years ago i understood how truly difficult it would be to put such a rich complex and multilayered story into one movie as david lynch attempted to do in 1984 for which i still have a great sentimental attachment after watching it as a child on vhs many times    i truly hope this movie is successful enough to allow villeneuve the complete his vision for part 2 as this a story in the sciencefiction realm that is among the most important and influential of all    added after seeing it on halloween day on a relatively large movie screen with goodgreat sound harkins cine 1 and then at an amc imax a week later i can confirm that dune is absolutely worth watching multiple times in a theater it is a glorious beautiful meditative work of art and the superb audiohans zimmer soundtrack can truly be appreciated best in cinema
Oct 23 2021,positive,ive been a dune fan for decades reading the original books through god emperor of dune watching the dino di laurentis dune in the theater owning that movie on vhs and later dvd i played the dune boardgame wish i still had it i own the syfy miniseries  my expectations of this movie were hopefully optimistic but tempered by the sad fact that science fiction never lives up the world the author creates    but damn denis villeneuve did this one right yes the visuals are spectacular much as i enjoy cgi most of todays movies are horrible with the same boring battle scenes depicting hordes of tiny crowd simulations or massive ahem algorithmically generated landscapes not here as the world of arrakis and the guild spacers and castle caladan lived up the image in my mind its magnificent the framing the scope the costuming lighting  everything  was stunning but more importantly believeable it felt real    casting was equally superb i never expect film to mirror the characters in the book as there are far too many in herberts novel trying to do so leads to a melange ahem of alltoosimilar voices and people that its impossible to feel for any of them trim too many and theres rightful outrage if pivotal characters are missing and again villeneuive nails it these actors owned their roles and disappeared into paul and jessica duncan and gurney baron and rabban harkonnen chani and yes liet kynes  these actors know their craft    finallly the adaptation completely floored me how do you adapt a book that exists half the time in headspace  thoughts internal monologue princess irulans supporting histories  into a visual that doesnt feel like a reading of war and peace how do you modernize a fifty year old story that had 1960s expectations of the role of the women and notions of empire i dont know all the tricks of filmmaking that were used but i know that it worked the sense of herberts universe is there without the dated pieces it worked     no dune wasnt completely flawless there are a couple places where the fremens sense of revelation and emerging prophecy felt a little stilted but i understand why they needed to be there in the book it amounts to a few lines in hundreds of pages but in the movie theres no clean way to insert it all said it was handled decently yes i wanted more of duncan and gurney i wanted more back story of the mentats and the butlerian jihad i was waiting for irulan to appear but a six hour part 1 would not have worked    ill be watching this again and again in preparation for part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,hated that they left you hanging at the end i liked the original much better  i wont pay to see the 2nd installment
Oct 23 2021,positive,this movie was great the production design the music the atmosphere everything was where it was supposed to be a few slow parts but not enough to bring the movie down significantly
Oct 23 2021,positive,excellent see it in imax
Oct 23 2021,positive,great story like the actors and actresses
Oct 23 2021,positive,stunning special effects  stellar cast and performances  let the franchise begin
Oct 23 2021,negative,slow not nearly as much action as the trailer would have you believe and the story line was weird
Oct 23 2021,positive,great movie would watch again
Oct 23 2021,positive,this is the greatest movie of the decade dune raises the bar to an unbelievable levelthis one is a masterpiece it is a must see
Oct 23 2021,positive,an epic scifi blockbuster that needs to be seen in theaters and when it reaches the end it leaves you wanting more looking forward to part two
Oct 23 2021,positive,best movie adaption of the book so far  really well done and enjoyed it
Oct 23 2021,negative,it was so boring  nothing happens as it just crawls forward finally to the same battle scene we see again and again   yes and what is different about this movie is that instead of showing a 90 pound girl throwing strong men around like they are rag dolls well now we have a 90 pound little boy throwing around strong men  really this movie is just thinly veiled worship of arabic culture unapologetically barbarian so how do the reconcile this slap in the face of masculine strength with the pretense the effeminate weakness can somehow really pack the harder punch   and then it is just another movie about some chosen one some savior  isnt that kind of getting old  but maybe i shouldnt be so critical of this movie since something really great might have happened before some loud explosion woke me up  but still perhaps the only point of this movie was to lead to the sequel well no not me  viewers can reward the making of this kind of movie expecting us to come back for more when the initial serving was such thin gruel
Oct 23 2021,positive,pretty good movie excited that its part 1
Oct 23 2021,positive,this movie was as good as i hoped it was going to be great story with great acting and great visuals this is only part one so it will leave you craving more when its over i really really hope part two starts production soon
Oct 23 2021,positive,dune was masterful i highly recommend if you are going to watch it to do so in imax the visuals are so stunning the only movie that comes close in my mind is blade runner the audio design is unreal also totally different from how i envisioned
Oct 23 2021,positive,amazing the cinematography script acting and directing where all phenomenal denis villenue has created a masterpiece only missing half a star as its half of a whole when part 2 is release and matches this itll be adjusted accordingly
Oct 23 2021,positive,i loved it ive watched the movie 3 times now since i live in jordan and i loved it more each time
Oct 23 2021,positive,great rendition of the story  each version has pluses and minuses but im saying this is my favorite now
Oct 23 2021,positive,it was awesome the begging middle and end were so good
Oct 23 2021,positive,omg the best vision edition or rendition of dune ever cannot wait for part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,about as faithful to the book as possible with the transition to a movie fantastic representation of the first half of the book couldnt be happier
Oct 23 2021,negative,what a snooze fest art direction is stunning but so boring its all set up and wait for it  hope for the sequel
Oct 23 2021,negative,truly disappointing  no plot no character development no continuity no passion  pass
Oct 23 2021,positive,its a good movie for people who never read the books or watched the original movie or the tv miniseries
Oct 23 2021,positive,i really enjoyed the film great movie
Oct 23 2021,positive,i love this film direction performances cinematography and the score were all breathtaking this movie needs to be seen in the biggest screen you can find at the theater please show your support because we need dune part 2 to finish the first book
Oct 23 2021,positive,i dont remember the last time i left a movie feeling this way this movie almost feels spiritual and i dont even like the book it makes you realize how the rest of hollywood has gotten used to phoning movies in
Oct 23 2021,positive,fantastic i cannot wait to see this again i cannot wait to see it on dvd in my house and i cannot wait to see part two so stoked even being a fan of the books and the original 1984 version this version belongs wholeheartedly as being one of the best and most iconic adaptations love love love
Oct 23 2021,negative,good lord this film makes the last airbender look like a masterpiecedune 2021 is the most boring film in cinema history been to funerals that had more life than this cinematic dreckstay away far far away from this film
Oct 23 2021,positive,great action  good story wanted more closure  would see it again
Oct 23 2021,positive,a truly incredible film like peter jackson denis villenueve took great source material and made something special this film takes its time carefully crafting one of the great scifi books of alltime and does it without being boring     my only complaint is the soundtrack makes hans zimmer the al pacino of film composers loud booming noises with no melody but its not a distraction beyond that you have a truly epic film is it star wars or lotr a more accurate question is it a new hope or fellowship because there are still 2 more than could be great terrible or somewhere in between to me its up there cant yet say its at the level of those two films but this is villenueves magum opus to date
Oct 23 2021,negative,the special effects are great but the storyline is very boring im a huge scifi fan so this is a disappointment there is very little character development in good writing you show and dont tell the story this is mostly telling a story with visuals interspersed between long dialogues i think that if i had read the book i may have liked it more
Oct 23 2021,negative,part one as it comes on and then seat back and get ready to be like what are they saying audio from their speech was low no subtitles  the movie was a total waist of time 3 hours i could of been home painting or learn a new craft
Oct 23 2021,positive,lush cinematography intense intergalactic warfare and the violent immersion of a noblemans son timothy chalamet into a bitter and complex inheritance timothy chalamets and rebecca fergusons  lady jessica scenes are particularly taut and compelling
Oct 23 2021,positive,was blown away with the visuals and great musical scare
Oct 23 2021,negative,booooriiing zendaya wasnt even in the movie she just was in the closing scene  the whole movie was basically in black  white 
Oct 23 2021,positive,a new and unique way of storytelling a truly epic new sci fi with thought provoking and emotional story telling acting performances were captivating and made you feel the passion the cast had for this project you feel that they are excited to come back the world was so grounded yet massive and immersive people might have a sense that there should have been more or a sense of the movie being incomplete but thats only because movies rarely focus on the smaller moments and character building like this film doesyou felt apart of this you are invested in pauls story and that of this world and this movie does a great job setting up everything in an epic and emotional and riveting way honestly this is the first time ive watched a movie so different yet captivating all the same the climax and ending was brilliantly told the end is calm and quiet after and hopeful and a great emotional and action sequence
Oct 23 2021,positive,dune is amazing its everything i wanted and more my only complaint is that i wish it was longer as to include scenes from the book that i loved absolutely wonderful the production design the casting the sound design the special effects the soundtrack perfect
Oct 23 2021,positive,this more than lived up to the hype it was a masterpiece visually on an imax screen and i think they did a great job adapting something that is difficult to put on screen the slow burn style works for a first installment and the cast is remarkable my only gripe is that it isnt totally fulfilling since it relies so much on the story continuing in sequels
Oct 23 2021,positive,the plot was really thought provoking there was a fair amount of action the actors were really great too
Oct 23 2021,positive,it was ahmazing the first movie didnt stay with the book and although they didnt explain how the navigators fold space the cast and music and well all of it made up for it cant wait til the next one gonna buy this one on digital
Oct 23 2021,positive,this is everything a real scifi or dune fan could have hoped for this is a real epic masterpiece and cant wait for part two
Oct 23 2021,positive,very well done great cinematography special effects actors acting and obviously the story is awesome  sadly we do not have the next movie ready to go and likely will have to wait years to get resolution
Oct 23 2021,positive,it is a huge film that is gorgeous to watch you must see it on a big screen to appreciate the beauty the best job yet of brining such an epic story to the screen the movie stays pretty true to the book and if they do not get a go for part 2 it would be a crying shame and you know valuable tears are on arrikis
Oct 23 2021,positive,visually stunning suspenseful and inspiring score great story execution and acting performance exceptional
Oct 23 2021,negative,many scenes too dark couldnt see details even though i was watching in imax theater
Oct 23 2021,positive,outstanding interpretation of a classic  not quite sure that the actors chosen accurately fit the roles though especially timothy chalamade as paul atreides  his characterization seems to disconnected from the reality around him thanks to his many flashback dreams  but the cinematography is second to none and it must be seen at the theater to be appreciated  take my advice and buy yourself a ticket to see it
Oct 23 2021,positive,unbelievable movie go see it in theaters not hbo
Oct 23 2021,positive,excellent movie ive never read the books and barely remember the old version of the movie as a kid but this new dune movie is epic in scale beautiful worldbuilding fleshes out an interesting universe that this movie takes place in    it has the expansive major scifi  fantasy feel of the og star wars or lord of the rings trilogy     its a bit moody and ambient at times but it draws you in cant wait to see part 2
Oct 23 2021,positive,i really loved this film i really hope they get to continue great actors  actresses beautiful scenery cant wait for the next one
Oct 23 2021,negative,this movie sucks wanted to gouge my eyes and ears out
Oct 23 2021,positive,you know how it is when someone puts out a hit song then a decade later some else samples it with a modern beat at first youre reminded about how great the song is but after a while you realize that as nice as it sounds its the same old song if youve seen dune 1984 youll notice the upgrade in design and special effects but as th the movie drags on youll realize that its the same old song if you havent seen dune 1984 then watch this one instead
Oct 23 2021,positive,well done dramatization of one of the great novels of the 20th century
Oct 23 2021,positive,exceptional film must see in a theater
Oct 23 2021,positive,it was just the perfect sci fi movie i absolutely recommend it its perfection
Oct 23 2021,positive,this remake stopped short on the story the original and the first remake told the whole story   this one makes you think there will be a part 2 to this drama left lacking in many ways but this is my opinion
Oct 23 2021,positive,dune is almost everything that we expected it to be and even more
Oct 23 2021,negative,slow long and villain is not strong
Oct 23 2021,positive,absolute masterpiece of a movie incredible portrayal of an amazing story
Oct 23 2021,positive,yeah its a good movie i wasnt really impressed with how long it is and it does get quite boring and we dont know hardly anything about any of the characters and a lot of the main characters get killed throughout the film without much character development the graphics visual effects sounds lighting and acting are all very well done but its just not that interesting of a story so far and apparently its part one of how many parts  we dont know goo dstory but not getting 4 or 5 stars out of me any day do better
Oct 23 2021,positive,the stunning cinematography along side a storyline that continues to keep you in your seat throughout the entire movie is exactly what 2021 needed for any movie goers    the world building is great for a first movie and really hope it is expanded apon in the sequel    the only problem i can nit pick is that the dialogue can be fast in certain scenes added with vocals by characters that seem to be whispering made it hard to follow those specific scenes which unfortunately were pivotal in the character development    giving this a full 5 stars irregardless to the whispering dialogue go watch this movie
Oct 23 2021,positive,visually stunning and beautifully filmed a little confusing at times but very good long but didnt feel that long kept me interested
Oct 23 2021,positive,i was skeptical especially of the actor playing paul but he eventually won me over the rest of the cast cinematography special effects were awesome the story was handled well gonna rewatch as much as possible please please please make part 2 of the dune story
Oct 23 2021,positive,great cinematography acting music and scenery a must see for scifi fans
Oct 23 2021,positive,great visuals and a faithful adaptation
Oct 23 2021,positive,this was very entertaining all the way through  love the book
Oct 23 2021,positive,i absolutely loved dune they did a great job on the worldbuilding and lore i describe it as a mix of rogue squadron and game of thrones i cannot wait until part ii the scenery and sound was great this gave the feelings i was hoping to but didnt get from the latest star wars movies overall id give it a 910
Oct 23 2021,positive,just go see it but remember dont be mad that this is just part 1 i am mad that part 2 doesnt start next week
Oct 23 2021,positive,it is a good movie however some of the events are out of sequence from the sequence in the book it doesnt make sense but it doesnt change the quality of the movieit just leaves you scratching your head  other than that minor glitch it is an moviebut you should hit the bathroom right before it begins so you dont miss any of the 2 12 hour showtime
Oct 23 2021,negative,great story well cast and all the money needed for costumes and scenery wasted with a director who is incapable of pacing it properly  it had the artistry of a paint by numbers art piece   and did they use the same crap person from game of thrones to light night scenes when they compared it to star wars they were right if they meant the most recent movie what a dull disappointment
Oct 22 2021,positive,big vision a must in imax format fascinated with denis vellenueves choices with this adaptation as a fan of the book as well as the 1984 film i am very excited about this version
Oct 22 2021,positive,fantastic movie destined to be a classic scifi movie even with just part 1 cant wait to see part 2 love the dragonfly ornithopters
Oct 22 2021,positive,very faithful adaptation of the first half of the book i felt like the cast all fit perfectly in their roles
Oct 22 2021,positive,exceptionally well done very true to the book from what i remember great cast excellent visual effects
Oct 22 2021,positive,great movie very epic great cinematography great musics great story telling great casting everything was perfect probably the best movie in 2021     timothee chalamet was gorgeous as always
Oct 22 2021,positive,never seen any of the dune movies before i have to say i wasnt holding a lot of hope of this being any good but i was wrong it will only be a see a waste if the remainder of the story isnt told
Oct 22 2021,negative,want my money back it is the first movie we walked out of
Oct 22 2021,positive,the movie was amazing and visually stunning 2 issues this is a part one  definitely going to need at least 2 more parts to do the story justice the volume nonspeaking sound was so loud i had to plug my ears at times is this the fault of the production or the theater
Oct 22 2021,positive,ohhhat the start off it said part 1  i knew at this moment it going to be a good movieand it didnt disappoint
Oct 22 2021,positive,an absolute masterpiece that left me fighting for breath more than once
Oct 22 2021,positive,epic and very well done
Oct 22 2021,positive,it was good to see ethnicity in this version disappointed that the director was not able to complete the full story in this version
Oct 22 2021,positive,one of the best films of the 21st century which will not become outdated visually even after 50 years denis villeneuve are the reincarnations of kubrick and bergman of our time
Oct 22 2021,negative,there are so many things wrong with this film that i cant fit them all in one box first this is the directors dune not frank herberts dune second it is wildly miscast they may be good actors but they have the wrong actors in the roles chalamets paul is nothing like the paul of the book third the score is horrible fourth the film is boring the book needed to be contracted but so do the scene oddly they actually add things that are not in the book
Oct 22 2021,positive,i believe it was a good first step and look forward to the next the acting was excellent as was the storyline
Oct 22 2021,neutral,the movie follows the dune book sometimes but lacks sequential story scenes and while the characters are nice to look during the long camera shots they lack definition and solidity maybe the sequels will fill in those voids when they are made
Oct 22 2021,positive,as a fan of the source material and as someone who hates the 1984 movie i absolutely loved this movie the source material here is slow and can easily loose people much like the 1984 movie but this did such a good job of keeping you interested in the building of the story by keeping you intensely interested in the characters their experiences and this universe building up around these characters everyone involved in making this movie deserves a lot of credit for taking a story that can so easily turn people away due to its pacing and making something amazing
Oct 22 2021,positive,wow worth the wait and now waiting for more
Oct 22 2021,positive,very important leave your house  to see this on the biggest screen you can get to the full experience on imax was mind bending im going again     a monolith masterpiece
Oct 22 2021,positive,villeneuve delivers a solid adaptation of the scifi epic dune the action scenes are well paced and further the plot rather than feeling like meaningless additions for the sake of a cgi set piece the actors all turn in solid performances particularly chalamet and isaac zendaya appears sparsely in the movie but is excellent in her scenes and appears to be set up for a massive role in part 2 the writing is well paced and sets dune above most of the modern action movie milieu a must see for cinephiles
Oct 22 2021,positive,a visual masterpiece  acting a  as a dune fan im just disappointed that i have to wait for sequels
Oct 22 2021,positive,very well done the best movie i have seen this year great acting fantastic special effects and of course a powerful storyline cant wait for part ii and the music is exceptional 
Oct 22 2021,negative,slooooooooooooooooooooooooow  i cant believe this director was talking bs about marvel movies  hed tank one
Oct 22 2021,positive,perfect in almost every way and left me stunned when i left
Oct 22 2021,positive,have already watched 3 times so good
Oct 22 2021,positive,the music and graphics were incredible it is the main reason i enjoyed the movie however there wasnt really a clear narrative it ended so abruptly as well truly felt unfinished and was unsatisfying by the end
Oct 22 2021,positive,really a masterpiece denis didnt disappoint neither did hans zimmer the real themes of the original book are very clear in the movie the ecology the power of the desert the danger of superstition and leaderworship
Oct 22 2021,positive,fantastic world building and arakis is exactly how i imagined it would be from the books
Oct 22 2021,positive,absolutely epic     best film ive seen since blade runner 2049
Oct 22 2021,positive,its storyline may bore or confuse the general public but with just a glimpse into the property in any past form one can enjoy the improvements from its performances to its vastly visceral visuals and epic hans zimmer score
Oct 22 2021,positive,good acting i liked the character  the cinematography was great as well as the action i am looking forward to another sequel i hope we do not have to wait as long as we did for this one
Oct 22 2021,negative,it was technically well done and pretty but i came for a story and characters i could get into  it was dull and just full of tropes and extremely slow
Oct 22 2021,positive,gorgeous film well cast cant wait fir the sequel
Oct 22 2021,positive,instantly one of my favourite movies of all time masterfully adapted
Oct 22 2021,negative,there is a whole lot going on in this movie and i know its a build up to the second installment but however with all the grandeur that is happening it doesnt avoid the undeniable fact that it is unfortunately lacking a bit of soul while it tries hard to do so but the characters arent fleshed out enough for you to even care about them and certain editing decisions are a bit odd which hurts the flow and logic of the movie scenes that appears totally random or rushed and adding nothing to the story again the personalities arent fleshed out which makes the viewer have no empathy for whats going on the whole watch was like a hallucenetic bad trip maybe it was intended to be that way in that regard it is a succes lol
Oct 22 2021,positive,a little different from the book but still great
Oct 22 2021,positive,i read this 5 times as a kid and its long past time somebody did this novel justice fingers crossed the remainder of the book is greenlit for production
Oct 22 2021,positive,the movie was generally try to the original story the acting was good and effects were awesome the downside for me was that the sound effects were so loud that they distracted from the action the most common example of this was whenever a craft was landing or taking off
Oct 22 2021,positive,loved this movie strayed from the book but it was still a great movie cant wait to see part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,too loud too loud ears still ringing two hours later great movie though
Oct 22 2021,positive,this movie definitely draws you into its world if you view it like part 1 of a series its an easy 5 stars lays a solid foundation but also delivers action  lore cinematic gold
Oct 22 2021,neutral,a huge movie that is visually stunning  i just found it plodding and a bit boring  they omitted or skimmed over so many imo important character and plot explanations  a whole lot of  moody visuals with eerie music  if you loved blade runner 2049 you will definitely love it
Oct 22 2021,positive,as someone who read the books along time ago i felt they did a great job capturing the world characters politics and over all feel of the story this is not easy to do  i also loved how the movie flowed overall it was well paced  what i didnt really care for were the extremely loud aspects of the film it might have been the theater we were in and i get it its the dolby atmos super mega ultra experience but it seriously was way too loud to the point of it being distracting and hard to focus on the dialogue
Oct 22 2021,neutral,its too slow nearly two and a half hours with not a lot happening then we have to wait and see whether we even get to see the rest of the story in a possible part 2 that may not even get made
Oct 22 2021,positive,wow just all i can say is wow being a big fan of the book and loving this story  the cast story line visual special effects sound  experienced this in imax  was phenomenal   for once a remake was not disappointing  go see this movie
Oct 22 2021,positive,awesome spectacular cant wait for more
Oct 22 2021,positive,great visuals and acting i so hope they green light the second film epic scifi we have been needing see it on the biggest screen and best sound system first
Oct 22 2021,positive,best scifi movie of the year
Oct 22 2021,positive,you have to remember how dense the source material is that being said this rendition honors the book really well in fact one of the best adaptations on top of that a hollywood budget that really does make it shine also remember this is just part 1 please watch it in the theater we have to do our part if we want to see part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,long movie but better than the original  must see on imax to see full effects of movie
Oct 22 2021,positive,wow what an amazing adaptation of the novel this movie nails it on so many levels highly recommend it
Oct 22 2021,positive,i have been waiting for this movie almost all my life the visuals are spectacular congratulations to the filmmaker and cast and crew
Oct 22 2021,positive,denis villeneuve has delivered an absolutely gorgeous and grand film with dune and has successfully captured the essence of frank herberts amazing novel  at least the first half of the novel which is all that this film covers leaving the rest for a sequel timothée chalamet rebecca ferguson oscar isaac and jason momoa deliver some terrific performances and in general the cast is superb the actors have truly brought the characters to life under villeneuves careful guidance i left the theater with odd mixture of supreme satisfaction and desperate longing for more villeneuve has quickly become my favorite current director and i am incredibly grateful to him for brilliantly bringing one of my favorite books to life in such a beautiful and artistic way full of humanity and wonder dune ii cannot get here soon enough to finish this perfect adaptation in the meantime i am going to content myself with the joys of rewatching and savoring this delightful film
Oct 22 2021,positive,another masterpiece from denis villeneuve and a mustsee in theaters dont stream this one at home
Oct 22 2021,positive,this movie adapts the first part of the book so well the cinematography and score perfectly tell the story of the expansive dune universe as a huge fan of the books i was blown away by this movie
Oct 22 2021,positive,i never saw the original but was very pleased with this high sci fi is rarely done well but this was my only complaint is that this is part one i want part two     it didnt feel as long as it was that means it had good pacing
Oct 22 2021,positive,what a fabulous adaptation of the film and have to say it is so beautiful and all the performances were spot on even if you havent read the book it is not hard to follow but if you have read the book you will be very happy with this adaptation i saw it last night in a dolby theater i highly recommend seeing this film in the theater either dolby or imax and today watched it again on hbomax on my dolby vision television after the film several people stayed to the end of the credits to discuss the film and one of them called it the baby of lord of the rings and star wars and i have to say that is a very good description if you are a fan of well told epic fantasyscience fiction if youve been waiting for a reason to go back to a theater this one is a must see in the theater and worth seeing that way
Oct 22 2021,positive,i thought the movie was for the most part  and most of the most important parts  faithful to the novel  when changes are required to condense the story while retaining its essence thats understandable and sometimes acceptable and i think this meets that standard  a very high standard being required for this tale  that sets it far above films with gratuitous damaging departures like peter the butcher jacksons hobbit or appletvs foundation  on other hand they did a pretty good job of making it unlikely youd notice this was part one  but if they retain the standards in whatever parts there may be more parts is a very good thing
Oct 22 2021,positive,a perfect film as close to the book as you could want and shot so beautifully the fx are also spot on and id definitely recommend seeing dune in imax i dont understand the complaints about dune being slow because the pace is this film is great
Oct 22 2021,positive,there must be something i missed let me skim the book again
Oct 22 2021,positive,fantastic movie moves right alongwaiting to see the next one
Oct 22 2021,positive,a solid first part to the epic frank herbert story somehow the director is able to convey the story with less dialogue than the book or the previous film the use of visual cues makes sense and conveys plot and backstory without distracting from the core story the only negative is that the film is only part one and that i must wait too long for part two 
Oct 22 2021,positive,dune review  the good visually incredible and follows the beats of the book very well most of the acting is great timothée chalamet is perfect casting for paul and bautista is everything i thought raban was in my mind   the bad despite being nearly 3 hours long the pacing feels rushed some cuts are really jarring and i get the feeling that people who havent read the book will feel confused theres also a lot of shots of a bulls head that seem to serve no purpose beyond being nod at one of the prequal books rebecca ferguson isnt great as lady jessica which is a shame considering how great timothée chalamet is as paul a lot of context feels like its missing    if youve read the book its an easy 455 or even 55 if not its probably lower at 355 i hope theres a longer directors cut
Oct 22 2021,positive,this is the dune ive been waiting for dunes pt 1 is epic its not often a film gives you starwars and lord of the rings feels but dine delivers the visuals are grand the sound effects an music are original and disturbing in a good way the cast is excellent the script delivers enough exposition to follow the twists and turns without getting overwhelmed while it will remind you of other films it doesnt look like anything youve seen before
Oct 22 2021,positive,ive read the series ive watched the oldfirst movie a number of times but this this is epic beautifully cinematic amazing effects solid characters  its a fantastic adaptation id say and a great testament to the series which is looong its old scifi after all settle in enjoy the ride i can only imagine how amazing the second movie is going to be
Oct 22 2021,positive,great cinematography and a great story acting was great as well
Oct 22 2021,positive,saw it today and after i wait for a while   ill see it again  great movie   waiting on part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,one of the best films this year  great acting wonderful visuals and cinematography and great score  i cant wait for parts 2 and 3
Oct 22 2021,positive,great movie got to see the original in 1984 as well in the theater a lot of climate change propaganda but still really good
Oct 22 2021,positive,this version does justice to the book  very good
Oct 22 2021,positive,simply awesome cgi was unbelievable
Oct 22 2021,positive,i did not know much about dune world i really enjoyed the hell out of this movie i cannot wait for part two
Oct 22 2021,positive,stunning all around spectacular  cinematography that leaves your senses gliding over the vivid textures actors were just brilliant  well cast
Oct 22 2021,positive,epic and beautiful and could have been another 2 hours and would have been fantastic 
Oct 22 2021,positive,great movie great special effects all throughout the movie dont appreciate they made the first book into a 2 part movie but overall im not mad at it definitely looking forward to part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,i cant wait for the next one to come out
Oct 22 2021,negative,i would prefer to watch sand blow better than the original
Oct 22 2021,positive,ive been a dune fan since the 80s and i was impressed with this film the casting was on point the soundtrack was goosebump inducing and the script was excellent added a few things from the book that were missed in the 84 version and i truly appreciated it
Oct 22 2021,positive,didnt know anything about dune so went in blind   got to say i really enjoyed the story and cant wait for part 2   atmos sound was fantastic and filmed very well  wanted more good first part
Oct 22 2021,positive,mind blowing in so many ways not just by the movie and story but by denis villeneuve as stated nearly every sceneframe is a work of art but the way he subtly nodsreferences all of the previous adaptations lynch syfy jodorowsky and makes it his own its like musical riffing but in visual form truly geniusnext level movie making and the scoreso metal but minimalistatmospheric and bombastic at the same time shades of ethnictribal with blade runnernew wavecyber punktechno this is the birth of an art form not a motion picture but motion art not everybody might enjoyappreciate it though
Oct 22 2021,positive,great cinematography awesome soundtrack hans zimmer good storyline some scenes straight out of a horror movie lotsa blood and violence a dark and sinister undertone to it as well hoping for part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,visually stunning and a great soundscape lacks character development and story building if i hadnt already read the book i might have been lost in some places
Oct 22 2021,positive,this movie was so incredible one of the best movies ive seen in years it was obviously incomplete because its intended to be a twopart series but man was it incredible
Oct 22 2021,positive,amazing adaptation though jessica was more of an emotional wreck than i imagined her
Oct 22 2021,positive,a perfect adaptation of the book with a stellar score and beautiful visuals
Oct 22 2021,positive,very surprised riveting great performances tremendous special effects compelling story see it on biggest screen possible
Oct 22 2021,positive,epic  takes time to tell the story
Oct 22 2021,positive,the fact they hid the part one in the title super glad they did because it made it so they fully tell the story
Oct 22 2021,positive,followed the book closely well done movie cant wait to see the sequel
Oct 22 2021,positive,its the greatest scifi movie in this two years follows the original book and the details are amazing
Oct 22 2021,positive,phenomenal do not watch at home imax is the only way to bear witness to shai hulud
Oct 22 2021,positive,this is dune big fan of the books and this vision of the story is the definitive one
Oct 22 2021,neutral,not what i thought it would be the music in the movie drowned out the talking at times so lost track not a movie i would see again
Oct 22 2021,positive,denis villeneuve has pulled off a truly spectacular piece of cinematic film making with dune everything from the cinematography to the score to the incredible sweeping landscapes and rich lore and backstory that stays true to the source material i can only hope that the film does well enough in the theater so we can see this truly epic story come to conclusion
Oct 22 2021,positive,dune 2021 is a striking scifi epic both in visuals and in length  it often reminded me of lawrence of arabia  having read dune several decades ago i remembered much of the basic story and was pleased to see how much denis villeneuve was able to incorporate   i watched the film with my 12yearold daughter who enjoyed it as well  i recommend this film to those who enjoy scifi epics outstanding special effects and the desert
Oct 22 2021,positive,i enjoyed the movie but had some disappointments  the big one is that it only covers half the story  my first indication was that the title screen says dune in big letters then part one in smaller letters  huh  i was unaware of this     visually it does a great job at capturing the huge scale of everything mere mortal people so small amid giant machines  vast deserts    it has the slick look of a very modern film but in my opinion lacks the artistry of the beautiful original film  nice musical score though     at best im lukewarm regarding performances  jason momoa is great  rebecca ferguson does a pretty good job  timothy chalamet does an ok job at best  theres little of zendayas role yet but my god is she ever beautiful  overall though the whole thing lacks something  for one thing i felt zero emotion     the big bummer  was how little was shown of the wonderful worms  guess that the director is saving that for part two      anyway id only personally recommend it to folks who are already fans of the dune saga ones who might enjoy another take on filming the story  i would think that the uninitiated would be rendered disinterested     thats it i too was left disinterested  but i still look forward to part two  i want to see those worms
Oct 22 2021,positive,this was as good an adaptation of frank herberts masterpiece as we could have got denis villeneuve did an absolutely amazing job as excepted from one of the best film directors in the world right now the performances where great all over the board hans zimmer did it again with a dynamic pulsating score that gave the film an extra kick cant wait for the second part of this masterpiece
Oct 22 2021,positive,a masterpiece definitely a mustwatch in the theater if youve read the book you will be amazed
Oct 22 2021,positive,i liked that it followed the novel line fairly close  building the storyline was good for those who didnt know about dune it gave enough background to give an idea of what is going on even my significant other enjoyed it
Oct 22 2021,positive,this is truly one of the best movies ive ever seen and im a true cinephile absolutely stunning in every positive way
Oct 22 2021,positive,that was just awesome
Oct 22 2021,positive,totally up to my expectations great cinematography capsulating plot development and so was the acting loved it cantt wait for the next one i just hope they dont make more than 3 parts
Oct 22 2021,positive,very true to the books pacing got pretty quick in the second half and some secondary characters didnt get a lot of screen time but all in all as close to 55 as youre going to get
Oct 22 2021,positive,a bit slow but i recommend watching blade runner 2049 or arrival first to get used to denis villeneuves work since he is more about the story visuals and a lot of dialogue than nonstop action  the film is like an old school epic that are made much anymore nevertheless a stunning and engaging epic   if you liked this check out blade runner 2049 arrival dune 1984 frank herberts dune children of dune
Oct 22 2021,positive,dune is an absolute feast for the eyes and ears stunning cinematography accompanied by an immersive soundtrack that fits every scene like a glove     for those that have been lucky enough to have read the novel you will be rewarded ive been waiting for more than 35 years for what i consider the best science fiction story of all time tomorrow when i watch this with my sons ill get a sense of how this plays with those that dont know the story as deeply as those that have read it     each ship device costume and technology is fantastically realized while special effects technology has advanced so this can be made possible denis villeneuve and his team deserve kudos for the creative vision in the adaption from book to screen for example i could never visualize the ornithopters  the smaller flying ships on the planet arrakis here theyre represented as dragonflylike xwings that are mesmerizing and then theres the stillsuits the hunterseeker the shields and more     every actor brings their agame but rebecca fergusson as jessica and timothée chalamet as paul are just fabulous theres an iconic scene from the book where paul is subjected to the gom jabbar a lifeordeath test the scene requires both jessica and timothée to express themselves only with their facial expressions and body movements and they are fantastic     stellan skarsgard is more menacing than michael meyers in halloween kills as baron harkonnen  in fact his whole entourage are like human cenobites    while this should be seen in a theater i watched it on streaming and to be honest im glad i did i could rewind scenes i wanted to see again and put subtitles on as needed there is a lot of whispering and dune language that is hard to discern     i felt like i waited 10191 years for this to be finally released and it was worth the wait
Oct 22 2021,positive,beautiful film that creates an exciting world that i cannot wait revisit in part two the acting costumes lighting and score all complement one another in this faithful adapting to the source material as a guy who loves the book i feel like they did as good of a job as a could of telling this story were a few of the side characters under developed sure but this couldnt be a four hour movie see in imax you wont regret it
Oct 22 2021,positive,i read the novel years ago and believe that the movie hits many of the major book plot points  the world created in the movie is breathtaking and feels enormous  good movie cant wait for 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,i watched dune today on hbo max and it was breathtakinglike stars wars meets indiana jones
Oct 22 2021,positive,i think the visual style of the movie learned from the earlier david lynch version  doesnt have the overthetop elements of the lynch version and sticks more seriously to the original novel  i enjoyed it but found it a little bit emotionally flat although im not exactly sure why
Oct 22 2021,positive,just a phenomenal scifi  better than the book so far
Oct 22 2021,positive,great film must see sci fi film love it so much 3 hr masterpiece
Oct 22 2021,positive,lets begin by saying that a movie will always have to by necessity leave out a lot of whats in the book however to paraphrase stephen king book and movie are like fraternal twins born of the same brain but not identical     this adaptation was a feast for the eyes and made some really good choices with what to include all i can say to those saying that it was slow andor boring at times is that your eyes must be broken as every moment of pause in the story was accompanied by stunning visuals    the acting was top notch as those familiar with the book and even the david lynch movie can hear the inner thoughts of the characters just through expression my son lives comes to mind and i believe that those unfamiliar with the material will know what was happening most of the time    this movie is as much as i could ask for and i am distraught that part 2 isnt already on its way
Oct 22 2021,positive,what every scifi for the last 50 years should have been
Oct 22 2021,positive,much better than the 1984 version by far the filmmakers seemed to want to portray the material honestly as opposed to stamping a trendy directors style on it the performances kind of follow the same theme with chalamet ferguson and skarsgard really standing out in my opinion the rest of the cast serves the material very well sadly there wasnt much screen time with zendaya and bardem but theyll have a chance to impress in part 2 im in love with the look and scope of the worlds they depict it really has a galactic feel to it as good scifi should well done
Oct 22 2021,positive,this was more than just a movie or a film it was an experience an experience like the avengers lord of the rings star wars and more highly recommend witnessing this masterpiece in theaters most notably in imax or dolby
Oct 22 2021,positive,a great spectacle and of course a great story
Oct 22 2021,positive,absolutely fantastic its for movies like this you go to the theatre very book accurate but also enjoyable to someone who doesnt know anything about the book please please please make part two and three four five
Oct 22 2021,positive,i read the book long time ago    meanwhile i found the movie for the first chapter like a dream in video
Oct 22 2021,positive,outstanding casting beautiful cinematography and thoroughly enjoyable
Oct 22 2021,positive,i love dune this film is almost like an introduction to a great story when at the end zendayas character says this is only the beginning the foreshadowing tells me that there will hopefully be a sequel    dune is an exceptional film directed by denis villeneuve and adapted from the original scifi novel written by frank herbert and published in 1965 fans of the 1984 version directed by david lynch  and newcomers to dune  will be fascinated to see villeneuves incarnation i absolutely love the cast cinematography cgi makeup and many other aspects of this film    the film takes place on an unfamiliar desert planet arrakis  the world of arrakis is breathtaking i love the culture of the planet such as the languages they speak the homes the characters live in and of course the makeup and costumes have a huge effect on the aesthetic of this planet the story centers on a young man named paul atreides timothée chalamet who has an important role his family is responsible for mining a very valuable and powerful spice which is the most precious element on arrakis as the story unfolds its easy to be captivated and mesmerized into the illusion that you as the audience are with the characters on arrakis at times though i felt i was almost missing parts of the story since this is an adaptation from a book a lot of information has to be left out and i left the theater wanting to know more about arrakis i also felt that the beginning is a bit slow and most of the action in this film takes place near the end although that isnt a huge issue for me    now lets talk about the acting and this great ensemble cast with timothée chalamet in the lead role and his peers zendaya rebecca ferguson jason momoa oscar issac and many others ive been a huge fan of timothée chalamet for a long time and this is one of his best performances to date i love his character  you can really see how at the beginning of the movie he is a vulnerable yet strong boy who eventually stands his ground and knows his place i also love zendayas performance throughout the entire movie i was waiting to see her appearance i also love jason momoas character another one of my favorites finally oscar issac and rebecca ferguson work really well together and deliver very engaging performances    the costumes are very detailed and intricate which bring out fascinating elements of the planet and the cinematography by greig fraser and visual storytelling is so beautifully done and goes in perfect sync with the production design its important to acknowledge hans zimmer who composed all the music since his score brings the scifi storytelling to life    the message of the film is we all have a purpose we should find our own voice and destinies and true empathy is as powerful as blood lineage in our world    i give dune 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 14 to 18 plus adults i highly recommend seeing it in imax if you can by zoe c kids first
Oct 22 2021,positive,this film exceeded expectations which were high already  i havent been this satisfied in the theater experience since the lotr trilogy
Oct 22 2021,positive,little confusing hard to understand dialogue and too long
Oct 22 2021,positive,a faithful interpretation of the novel fantastic images that bring the story to life
Oct 22 2021,positive,it has to be seen on a big screen the casting soundtrack visual are all amazing i might go see again
Oct 22 2021,positive,a bit of a slow burn for the first half due to the wide and deep foundation that needs to be established in this universe the story telling was great the acting was sublime and the cinematography and score are absolutely brilliant keep in mind this is the first installment of at least two in this story and you will have a great experience
Oct 22 2021,positive,the previews looked really good but went in not knowing anything about the book or the original movie solid movie but its long and left us hanging for part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,rating a    dune sets the new standard for epic cinema with eyegamic visuals powerful sound design and score and a compelling story told surrounded by an absolutely massive scale    denis villeneuve adds yet another audiovisual masterpiece to his filmography despite some narrativepacing issues due to the heavy exposition and repetitive yet crucial dream sequences timothée chalamet and rebecca ferguson stand out in a stellar cast where everyone delivers performances no short of impressive    from the remarkable character work to the constantly captivating interactions without forgetting the spectacle of the riveting actionwar scenes the extremely layered screenplay is beautifully translated to the big screen where every viewer should definitely go to watch this movie    finally dont forget that epic scififantasy films are quite rare so enjoy them as much as you can when they come out instead of worrying about the comparisons with other sagas    theres enough space to love them all
Oct 22 2021,positive,cinematography was great  loved all the action
Oct 22 2021,positive,i really enjoyed the movie after reading the book now i just have to wait for part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,overall i enjoyed the movie  visual effects were great story line was close to the original and with the books  i didnt even have much of a problem with some of the woke changes  the only thing that really bothered me was the main character paul    he is too feminine looking to play a fellow the character  timothée chalamet is a fine actor if not a great one  my problem is this role was not for him  the original actor was kyle maclachlan  maclachlan made paul realistic  he was masculine and rather pretty for a man  chalamet is not believable at all  he is far too small to handle a sword as he did during the fight scenes  wielding a sword even one as small as a tanto  is hard work and takes far more musculature and stature than chalamet possesses  the idea that a small feminine child even with a lifetime of training could take out a seasoned warrior of far more physicality is just laughable  this reminds me so much of disneys ruination of star wars with the rey character
Oct 22 2021,positive,if i knew it was going to be a trilogy i would not have seen it
Oct 22 2021,positive,i was a bit afraid i would not be able to enjoy or understand a movie with so many moving elements such a wide universe so many characters and goals i was so happy i was wrong
Oct 22 2021,positive,great movie  best i have seen in 2021  they did a great job on casting  highly recommend watching this  didnt know it was only part 1  really hope they make part 2
Oct 22 2021,negative,i fell asleep 35 minutes in woke up and didnt miss anything
Oct 22 2021,positive,cinematic well written and acted now we need the second movie hope they started already good job
Oct 22 2021,positive,the movie was great until the power went out but the movie theaters making it very easy for us to get our money back thank you amc
Oct 22 2021,positive,if youve read the book and enjoyed it or even if you didnt enjoy it youll probably like this movie i went into it excited about the cast but dubious about the director im a contrarian when it comes to villeneuve i have not liked the other movies of his ive seen but as a fond reader of dune despite its flaws this was pretty much everything i could have hoped for and knowing that there will one hopes be a second half relieves any sorrow at not getting enough chani or fayd or the baron himself impressive wellacted gorgeous locales and decent special effects and if anyone thinks its too seriouswell so are the books    duke leto forever sniffle
Oct 22 2021,positive,a superior film very close to the the novel looking forward to the next film
Oct 22 2021,positive,great movie a bit slow at times but makes sense since it is laying the foundation for future movies definitely excited to rewatch and wait for more
Oct 22 2021,positive,stunning film  now where is the second half of the first book
Oct 22 2021,positive,for someone who didnt see the first dune i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and am eagerly anticipating part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,the best way to describe dune is that it is a spectacle and an enjoyable one at that its a film meant for the big screen which is certainly a positive for the industry itself    the film is certainly entertaining theres no doubt about that the many action scenes are fun to watch engaging too what denis villeneuve does best in almost all his films his keep the tension at a high level which is one of dunes strengths hes a master at it the cinematography again builds the world of arrakis in a unique way cinematographer greig fraser deserves praise for that the cgi also isnt overused and doesnt affect the narrative in annoying ways    i didnt know anything about the novels going so it takes time to get used to the world meaning that film can be too slow in parts and may pass you by but eventually it clicks    the films a spectacle which impressed me timothee chalamet was a good lead but jason momoa and oscar isaac gave standout performances an amazing ensemble    look forward to part 2 definitely recommend seeing it in cinemas a blockbuster in the truest sense     45
Oct 22 2021,positive,finally a movie that i can give 5 stars just because it doesnt suck its amazing how this is what used to be normal in the movie industry and for that alone im giving it 5 stars all the rest of the content character development story line etc doesnt even matter because this is how a movie should be run take notes
Oct 22 2021,positive,apparently my review is too long for here and causes a stack error  ill try to condense     it was good    good acting  good fx  im hoping it was more true to the book cause there were slower pacing points  but overall solid  character gender swap was weird but good actor so overall approve     casting and feel they have the fremen though greatly put out in front the white savior issues   overall solid parts better than the original movie  others felt like they padded the time a touch glad i saw it but not my favorite
Oct 22 2021,positive,absolutely amazing visually stunning great acting and very well paced felt very blade runner 2049 visually with the camera at times also the soundtrack is spot on
Oct 22 2021,negative,several things occurred to me about half way through watching this version of dune   1 its just as poorly written as david lynchs mess all those years ago  2 special effects shots of spaceships landing and taking off just arent all that compelling these days   3 im getting bored maybe ill watch the next episode of squid games  4 shouldnt an adult play paul  just then hbomax locked up and refused to play i switched to netflix and watched episode 3 will i try to resume watching anyones guess
Oct 22 2021,positive,amazing cinematography amazing sound they cleaned up some things from the original that i was not a fan of the actor in the lead role is the next big thing
Oct 22 2021,positive,best since interstellar must see on cinema
Oct 22 2021,positive,best of the three dune adaptations
Oct 22 2021,positive,very well thought out for people who never read the book     great acting by everyone great art direction with a strong visual language plus music to compliment the visuals terrific fx and atmosphere with a great story and cast    highly recommended
Oct 22 2021,positive,its like they took what i pictured in my mind from reading the book and put it up on the screen
Oct 22 2021,positive,wonderful and true to the book series i was surprised that it is part one how many parts are there
Oct 22 2021,positive,for me dune is a masterpiece i really want to see a sequel ive seen this movie twice in imax this was the world i imagined when i read the book my advice to those who are just going to watch dune go to the movie with low expectations and then you will like everything so dont expect anything and you will get everything
Oct 22 2021,neutral,no point in properly reviewing this until a part two is released however what i can say is that it doesnt linger long in the memory well constructed but hasnt left an impression whereas lynchs effort will never leave my psyche
Oct 22 2021,positive,amazing movie going back to start of story
Oct 22 2021,negative,soogy saga long and have seen a thousand times do not look forward to sequels etc taking up time 
Oct 22 2021,positive,i devoured the book when i was a teenager and it remains my favorite scifi novel of all time  i was extremely disappointed with the 1980s adaptation this latest version has been everything i hoped it would be  the casting is perfect
Oct 22 2021,positive,boring not much color
Oct 22 2021,positive,cant wait for the second half very entertaining
Oct 22 2021,positive,this adaptation is must see for fans of the book or newcomers of the series great special effects cast action sequences adaptation of the story
Oct 22 2021,positive,long and colorless a bit easier to understand than the david lynch version
Oct 22 2021,positive,amazing film true to the novel  amazing visuals sounds music acting special effects everything was just done so extremely well be sure to see in theaters
Oct 22 2021,positive,as close to perfect as ive seen in many years the movie is very patient with their pacing nothing is rushed lead actor was the best which is what you hope for with most movies
Oct 22 2021,positive,excellent  captured the pace and feel of the books
Oct 22 2021,positive,great rendition and interpretation of the book so far the visuals and cinematography were amazing the casting was spot on i think they could have gone a bit deeper into the book in the first movie its obviously too big of a story to pack into one movie but it would have been nice to move somewhat further along in the first one that said it was a satisfying first act and i cant wait for the next part seeing the kangaroo mouse foreshadowing the muaddib was a nice touch
Oct 22 2021,positive,fantastic cast fantastic cinematography loved it
Oct 22 2021,positive,lived up to my expectations frank herberts genredefining book form the 60s finally gets the cinematic treatment it is due albeit only its first half frustratingly
Oct 22 2021,neutral,two and a half hours of me waiting for something to happen yes sceneries were nice but it did not have scenery in mind for one of the best action scifi novels of them all oh yes and the fact that they have to have a marlon brando clone reprising his role on apocalypse now as the baron harkonnen makes me wonder in delight about the skill of this director
Oct 22 2021,positive,i grew up on the lynch version and devoured the books both herberts originals and andersons followups this is the movie i have been waiting for ive been excited since it was announced and i left the imax theater highly recommended viewing choice for this movie completely satisfied and aching for the next installment casting my gawd the casting  pacing art  direction music cinematography all brilliant theres so much to absorb here a perfectly realized universe with just enough exposition to keep us going and raw real emotion that isnt overshadowed by the gigantic set pieces intimate moments have weight and big moments are gargantuan  i cant wait for my next viewing
Oct 22 2021,positive,trying to be as unbiased as i can personal 910 but def a 810 movie if ur not really a fan and going into it blind and absolutely worth a theater experience if you can     would absolutely be a 1010 if part two was released but the movie would be lik 56 hours lol    it builds the world really well tho and gets through a lot of major story beats but the no resolution kinda sucks but everything about it is beautiful visually and the score is like an 1110 in my book    honestly if you like any denis villeneuve movies this has his name written all tf over it and ur really gonna like it
Oct 22 2021,positive,typical villeneuve gorgeous cinematography amazing audio if youve read dune then you know what your in for with the pacing of the story if you have not i can understand the pacing complaints but still a must see
Oct 22 2021,positive,it didnt keep you on the edge of your seat like i thought it wouldshould
Oct 22 2021,positive,denis villeneuves dune is an epic scifi adaptation  cinematic triumph a complex space opera filled with spectacular visual  aural perfection quit possibly the best book to film adaptation ive ever seen the story plot  pacing are executed with precision dune is so immersive fastest 2h 35m of my life the complex dynastic geopolitical intrigue philosophical ideologies  messianic themes are streamlined for general audiences without compromising the source material one the most artistic  meditative blockbusters of all time
Oct 22 2021,negative,this movie was terrible it ends right when you think its going to get good
Oct 22 2021,positive,ive been a fan of dune since i read the novel in 1983 and saw the original movie in 1984 ive seen all the miniseries read every book so far i can honestly say that while it has its flaws i was thrilled overall with this stunning and immersive take on frank herberts classic saga yes some of the political intrigue has been trimmed but the more streamlined story still captures the core of frank herberts message much better than the previous version the visuals are stunning at times the music transcendent and the young actor playing paul did a fantastic job capturing a young man on the cusp of life changing revelations and developments absolutely great i cant wait for part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,beautifully filmed cinematography with great performances and visual effects the film concerns paul atreides and whether he is the one and house atreides battle with house harkonnens for arrakis i really enjoyed the discussions paul has with his closest advisors regarding arrakis and his dreams the scene that obviously stands out is the gom jabbar scene i only wish there were more scenes of the supporting characters discussing paul like there were in the book i also wish there were more scenes of the harkonnens that amplifies the brutality of these people the scenes with the worms were phenomenal and truly displayed how destructive they can be overall a beautiful film that understands the scope and scale of herberts world
Oct 22 2021,positive,the first 1520 minutes i was not sure if i would like this movie or not but after that it got really good
Oct 22 2021,positive,greatest masterpiece  just wow  loved every minute of it 
Oct 22 2021,positive,great cast great cinematography but getting cut short was a major faux pas the movie ends abruptly when the real struggle begins on the new planet  walked out feeling i had just been kicked out at intermission everything else was a home run
Oct 22 2021,positive,the actor who plays paul completely captured the essence of the character for those who have read the book the visuals and 3d elements are incredible as well
Oct 22 2021,positive,seems i am in the minority but after a year of waiting and watching the trailer an unhealthy amount of times i found the actual movie simply dull and cold i felt none of the emotions i felt from the book which i read in preparation for the movie it was all so flat and vapid i dont get what others are seeing here i am a big fan of the director so it is a real shame
Oct 22 2021,positive,simply everything you could hope for
Oct 22 2021,positive,ive read dune many times and its one of my favorite books and frank herbert is one of my favorite authors    i cant say how unbelievably accurate this new film is to franks story and vision    denis villeneuve is a brilliant filmmaker and given what hollywood spews out these days its a miracle and a gift this script got made
Oct 22 2021,positive,i saw this in the theater although i have hbomax  i was full on amped for this movie release and was not disappointed  the actors particularly chalamet and momoa did really well in their performances  it was disappointing to see that the parts of jessica and leto were rather one dimensional and did not reflect the strong love they had for each other as well as the amazing strengths they had especially for jessicas character  her role was hesitant and fearful not commanding and quietly powerful  a shame  but the movie as a whole held your attention and i have thought about it since i left the theater  i cant believe we have to wait over two years for the second part though
Oct 22 2021,positive,this movie is a 1010 does the book justice and my friend who has never read the book understood it perfectly the whole cast is amazing and the cinematography and hans zimmers score everything about this movie is amazing please go see it in theaters imax so we can get part 2 ahhhhhh
Oct 22 2021,negative,dune has amazing sound and visuals its a little too dark cold and bizarre for my tastes though i had trouble relating and connecting emotionally
Oct 22 2021,positive,a masterpiece i wish it went on for twice as long the world building was incredible and managed to capture the spirit of the books very well every shot was a piece of art the cast were fantastic the sound was incredible cant wait for part two
Oct 22 2021,positive,there are no superlatives i can write that have not already been justly expressed this is simply one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life bravo
Oct 22 2021,positive,true in spirit to the book must we really wait for part two
Oct 22 2021,positive,visually stunning  finally the complete story i hope they make the 2 part asap 
Oct 22 2021,positive,visually stunning and good performances and affectingly constructed worlds
Oct 22 2021,positive,with the cast they were given shocked is an understatement on were they took this plot
Oct 22 2021,positive,i really want to see dune part two get made this is a great movie that makes me want more
Oct 22 2021,positive,this is a great film so much better than david lynchs version masterfully directed and filmed i cannot wait for dune part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,this movie is an absolute masterpiece finally a film does the source material justice on the big screen cant wait for part 2 and beyond
Oct 22 2021,positive,epic space adventure great acting great score loved it cant wait for part 2 better than disney star wars and the matrix
Oct 22 2021,positive,gives a new meaning to massive a true american sciencefiction epic film with godtier visuals and wrenchingly powerful performances this is as perfect a movie as a dune fan can ask for its expert worldbuilding and intricate mythology can only spur a new franchise and inspire others to check out the original film and even the book fear might be the mindkiller but this dune is a mindblower
Oct 22 2021,positive,enjoyable thought provoking sci fi movie a lot to ponder on leaving cinema and leaves me wanting a part two for definite
Oct 22 2021,positive,this movie is an epic masterpiece the best movie i have seen in a very long time i definitely recommend to watch it on the big screen the story is great the acting as well the visuals and soundmusic are mindblowing
Oct 22 2021,positive,i looked at my phone periodically to make sure we still had more time when it ended i was ready to see again and begging for part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,an epic modern masterpiece without question
Oct 22 2021,positive,everything you hoped for a dunemovie  everything you feared from a denis villeneuve movie
Oct 22 2021,positive,an amazing scifi epic with masterful performances
Oct 22 2021,positive,incredible movie and faithful adaptation grear for fans one thing to note is that this should be viewed as a part of a whole rather than as a single movie many criticisms are of it ending slow rather than on a climactic point but it perfectly sets up for the transition to the next part absolutely spectacular on all counts
Oct 22 2021,positive,greatest movie ive seen in years
Oct 22 2021,positive,best dune adaptation yet everything was absolutely beautiful not one dull moment some very minor changes to keep the pace going but no complaints about that
Oct 22 2021,positive,this was a very well made film that does an excellent job at showing not telling i dont remember a lot from the book but from what i can remember the movie adapts many of the concepts well the pacing is pretty slow when the movie ends while were still waiting for the third act but its a great setup and wonderous worldbuilding for what will hopefully be a strong sequel
Oct 22 2021,positive,awesome but need a little more back story before the movie begins
Oct 22 2021,negative,with stunning visuals im disappointed to say dune does not live up to the hype with a starstudded cast who provides great performances many are overlooked spoilers its genius how they explained the lore through paul watching documentaries about the planet they are moving to the problem is there is just so much lore which makes it hard to learn it all in such a short amount of time and keep it all straight they dont spend enough time on some of it too   the movie also has many pacing issues and is just plain out boring at parts the world building is there but very selfcontained the explanation of pauls powers is brief and his mother and her past is also very confusing the scene where at the end when paul fights the other guy is very unnecessary if they were going to slaughter her then she could have just came out and said she was pregnant this way no one had to die the spice is basically like weed but good for you and certain peoples eyes turn blue and then everyones turns blue like i said its all very confusing the ending is too open ended and leaves a lot to be desired a good cliffhanger to set up another movies is to close the story of the first movie but still have it continue in away but all the main plot is filled in for that part of the story this film cannot stand on its own as a good movie without the second one to finish it avengers infinity war is a great example of a twopart event where the stories are continuous but wrap up in its own movie and not making it feel like an absolute unfinished movie or like the ending was cut like this film does it stands alone and doesnt need avengers endgame to finish the story same things with the lord of the rings franchise they are 3 parts of one continuous story but each movie can stand as its own film without the one after it to back it up this movie just doesnt cant hold itself up and requires a sequel to make it feel better overall dune has amazing cinematography but lacks in the explanations and details of the contents inside it
Oct 22 2021,positive,incredible visuals and true to the novel by frank herbert villeneuve did a fantastic job balancing the internal dialogue everpresent in the books with action and emotion from the characters i was also very impressed with how they portrayed the voice in the movie
Oct 22 2021,positive,dune comes damn near perfection villeneuve manages to build an entire universe in just 25 hours this film is one of the most stunning arrays of cinematography i have ever seen coupled with acting led by chalamet that keeps you immersed from beginning to end perhaps the script could leave some wanting more but the grandeur of the universe overshadows any flaws in that department i wish it did not have to end and could have sat and watched 3 more hours
Oct 22 2021,positive,this film desperately needs part 2 to be made
Oct 22 2021,positive,denis villeneuves worldbuilding is fantastic as usual
Oct 22 2021,positive,it was good mostly followed the book but the changes were pretty nice to see  did fit in well cant wait for part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,i had high hopes because denis hasnt let me down before it lived up to every possible expectation and more casting is perfect acting is mostly good oh jason momoa why do people think he can act the beauty of arrakis and the great sand worms are worth the 25 hrs the slow artistic style is signature to denis but it truly works perfectly see this on the biggest screen possible
Oct 22 2021,positive,in order to turn dune into something that works as a film the creators had to sacrifice aspects of the story and i agree with their choices    feydrautha is not present and gone with him is the barons scheme to make feyd a hero after the tyranny of rabban  the dinner party scene is gone its unfilmable  the intrigues between lady jessica and thufir hawat are also not here    i believe that the film is better for these editorial decisions  the parts that remain are filmed lovingly and the casting decisions have proven themselves  i look forward to the next installment
Oct 22 2021,neutral,the cinema was amazing and the movie ok provided you never read the book i guess hopefully at some point the will flush out the the characters and the institutions of the empire dialogue was substandard at best this feels like it is taking dune down the same path that disney took star wars really should have a been a mini series
Oct 22 2021,positive,the movie is beautifully shot visuals are great the casting is stellar and for a 25 hour film it never really drags where the movie predictably struggles is to convey the complexity of its source material we dont really know what paul atreidis or any of the other characters are thinking which for those who have never read dune may leave them confused at times and for those who have read the novel frustrated some characters are just flat out 2dimensional an example being the baron harkonnen who in the novel is a truly interesting character     i think this is where it becomes very clear that the director is intending to do the real storytelling in a sequel as a stand alone there would be almost no reason to see this film i am really hoping for and excited by the prospect of a sequel a well executed sequel or trilogy could make this one of the best movie adaptations ever
Oct 22 2021,positive,was looking forward to this movie for so long and it exceeded my expectations i never read the books but immediately bought the first 3 after watching this movie felt like i was reading a book so i can only imagine how great the books are ive never asked for more after sitting for a 2 12 hour movie my favorite of 2021 so far
Oct 22 2021,positive,very cool hope to see the next one get made
Oct 22 2021,positive,beautiful cinematography
Oct 22 2021,negative,so boring skip this one
Oct 22 2021,positive,as a long time fan of the book i was skeptical as to how they were going to translate the epic novel filled with multiple layers and extensive inner dialogue into the big screen it definitely surpassed my expectations the cinematography  visualaudio effects were incredible and the overall insidious dark thematic elements were truly palpable they still missed many key elements of the book but i felt villenueve did an excellent job picking and choosing certain key features and amplifying them my final recommendation is to ensure seeing it in a theater to get the true immersive effects look forward to part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,denis should be applauded for bringing this complex scifi novel into a relatively easy to follow storyline with breathtaking cinematography and set design the entire cast from timothee on down was incredible
Oct 22 2021,positive,a timeless masterpiece refreshed with contemporary stunning visuals and a cast that brings their top performances masterfully executed with plenty of time to stop and smell the spice
Oct 22 2021,positive,pretty much a perfect scifi epic villeneuve weaves a beautiful rendition of the unfilmable book managing to incorporate a lot of the symbolism and cold beauty of herberts work casting is spot on music builds a world so different and beautifully hostile every frame of the film is a painting that needs to be seen on a big screen
Oct 22 2021,positive,incredible experience for cinephiles dune is the best cinematic experience i had in years
Oct 22 2021,positive,i admit i wasnt excited to see this  my hubby wanted to it was good though just mad i didnt know it was in parts  thus is only part 1 and part 2 doesnt come out until 2023
Oct 22 2021,positive,i want more things i was ras really happy with was it was made for those how read the book loved the seen where the duke and stilgar meet  it was a nice touchthe battle sene was epic i think they stayed true to frank herber writing
Oct 22 2021,positive,ok its a master piece in general covers a loot of details and preserve the essence of the books
Oct 22 2021,neutral,i wasnt a big fan of the 1984 david lynch version but even that was better than this cold and slowmoving take on the frank herbert novel the film only comes alive when josh brolin and jason momoa are onscreen i went in with super low expectations and they were definitely met 
Oct 22 2021,positive,i have long considered dune to be the best fiction i have ever read  the book transports the reader to another world with its great detail of cultural differences      one of the reasons the movie is far better than previous attempts is because the directorscreenwriter chose not to try and bring all the details in recognizing that too much information would distract from the main story line   overall i liked it and would recommend it especially to those who have not read the book  to those who have you may find yourself comparing it to the book and longing for that same feeling that the book leaves you with and the movie cant quite capture     i do believe that the movie will draw people to the books and that is a good thing
Oct 22 2021,positive,great story best cinematography ive seen in quite a while deep characters  cant wait for the 2nd movie
Oct 22 2021,positive,dune is one of my all time favorite book series the first 6 not the ones brian herbert wrote this movie does the story of dune justice the visuals are amazing reminiscent of lawrence of arabia the story follows the book very closely with minimal story changes and minor story cuts as a dune fan i loved it     more importantly my wife who is not a dune fan never read the books never saw the earlier adaptations and never heard of the name dune loved the movie as well the first thing she asked when the movie ended was when does the next one come out    in short this is the movie event of the year
Oct 22 2021,positive,its a movie your probably going to want to se more than 1 time just to take in all of the cinematography as well as some finer details in the story line but i really enjoyed it
Oct 22 2021,positive,absolute must see in imax denis has made the definitive adaptation of frank herberts dune
Oct 22 2021,positive,its been a long wait to get a film version of dune that captures the book and also to get this film due to covid it was worth the wait dune part 1 is spectacular looks fab sounds great good cast adapts the source material well i cant find a reason not to give it full marks
Oct 22 2021,positive,finally a dune movie as grand and compelling as the books it was painful to only see the first part of the book but i loved that denis villeneuve took the time to properly set up the story and characters there were still things i wish hed included from the book like paul getting offended at the reverend mothers implication that hes an animal rather than a human and asking if the kwisatz haderach is a human gom jabbar but at least the feel of the movie matched the book rather than feeling like a rushed chaotic synopsis as the other adaptations did i cant believe so many critics are focusing on the fact that only part of the book is told in the movie its perfect as is the music was amazing too one of my favorite scenes was that huge vista of the arriving boxlike spaceship with the tiny soldiers standing in front of it and the music dramatically unforgettably announcing it like the music for the monolith in 2001 a space odyssey very very pleased with this movie and cant wait to watch it again
Oct 22 2021,negative,i saw the 1984 stingversion  why why why    did no one   mention it  travestytravesty  travesty 
Oct 22 2021,positive,i missed certain things i was looking forward to paul shedding water gurney playing music they had 25 hours to tell the first hour of lynchs movie and missed out things he pulled from the book the establishment of a traitor and everyone worried who that may belittle things but if the only complaint i have is that a 25 hour movie is too short then that should be evidence that it was pretty friggin good
Oct 22 2021,positive,majestic vision and execution of a nighunfilmable novel about the first half of the novel anyway cant say how awesome it was to see this on a big screen and hear the rich sounds all around
Oct 22 2021,positive,when i left the hall i was covered in sweat a great picture and a soundtrack  the second film should definitely be
Oct 22 2021,positive,absolutely fabulous very well done dune done right thank you denis
Oct 22 2021,positive,it lives up to the hype and some fantastic in amc theatres with dolby sound
Oct 22 2021,positive,wow what an amazing movie visual effects and story were perfect the acting was great highly recommend going to see this movie in theatres if you want to experience it the best way
Oct 22 2021,positive,we all know villeneuve is an incredible director blade runner 2049 is perhaps one of the finest movies of all time in dune villeneuve once again demonstrates that he is a directing genius dune has been widely considered to be one of the most difficult book adaptations with much of the story told through exposition such dense lore and the magnitude of the universe many believed it was unrealistic they said the same about lord of the rings but peter jackson proved them all wrong villeneuve has done that with dune    everything from set design to costumes to choreography to effects to score and sound to and especially cinematography villeneuve does a masterful job of pruning the unnecessary exposition to focus on the core story telling it in a dense but expertly timed two hours and 35 minutes my wife who previously fell asleep in blade runner 2049 and has never read a dune novel was rapt i who have read 15 dune novels was rapt villeneuve has somehow turned dune into a movie with mass appeal while staying true to the source material and giving fans everything they could have ever asked for    villeneuve took the bold action of writing part one on the title screen to ensure audiences understand that this is the first part of the book but also to perhaps place some additional pressure on warner bros to green light part part two it will be an egregious injustice to the universe if villeneuve is not granted the right to produce the second part of this movie    i watched this in imax and cannot recommend the experience highly enough the soundscape was awe inspiring i will be watching this a second time in imax    this movie is 1010 i have extremely minor nitpicks which are not worth mentioning villeneuve has cemented himself as my favourite contemporary director and i look forward to watching anything and everything he should create in the future
Oct 22 2021,positive,exactly like the book if you are confused it is working the next movies will provide all the closure you need i am so excited for the next movies if you want immediate closure read the book
Oct 22 2021,positive,absolute masterclass stunning audiovisual go see it in imax
Oct 22 2021,positive,the new dune movie was phenomenal 1010     i have read the full series 3 times and the original novels 4 times it has ruled my imagination for the better part of two decades it has yet to be adapted properly the david lynch movie was garbage the scifi miniseries got a lot of it right but it was still pretty far away    i have been excited for denis villenueves dune since i first read about it he is a great director and it has an amazing cast there are a few things that were left out and there were a few things changed all in the effort of moving the film along they got very little wrong and dont think i didnt notice the things they did but it does not ruin anything    two things blew me away the first were the sandworms they arent exactly how i pictured them but they are amazing to see and we should get to see more of them in the future the second is the sound hans zimmer has made this such an auditory experience that is unlike anything my ears have ever experienced    this project was too much to fit into a single movie and the story is perfect to be split as there are two deinitive parts to the novel sadly warner brothers did not let both parts be made at the same time and the sequel is dependant on the success of this movie with the decision to release it on hbo max simultaneously with the theatrical release they have taken away a lot of the possible box office earnings     go see it in theaters then come home and watch it again and again on hbo max    denis villenueve hit for the cycle with this one topped off with a grand slam make many more dune movies warner brothers not just the sequel please     desert power
Oct 22 2021,positive,let me preface by saying that ive never read frank herberts book  my only previous experience with dune was the 1984 film with kyle maclachlan  i can understand why some people dislike the 1984 version but i kind of enjoy it  that being said i enjoyed the 2021 version of dune but i didnt enjoy it as much as i would have liked  first off i was unaware going in that this version was going to be split up into multiple movies  that was a big kick to the groinal region when the movie just up and stopped shortly after paul atreides meets up with the fremen on arakkis  i havent read ahead but i sincerely hope that they shot the rest of the movie already and then split it like has been done with other multipart movies like back to the future and the hobbit  id hate to think that the studio might pull the financial plug on making the end of the movie if it doesnt recoup its costs and turn a tidy profitwhich is entirely possible given that it didnt debut exclusively in theaters  scifi fans are a gregarious lot but im not sure they have enough disposable income to put this film over the top  however given that theres just not much quality options out there to watch at the theater or even on tv dune part 1 may make back what it cost to produce and then some  my favorite thing about the 2021 version of dune has got to be the cgi  even so i think it may have been underused  dune is all about spice and the worms but in part 1 we barely see the worms other than an occasional shot of a gaping mouth that frankly looks like an anus  all the spaceships the buildings and the planets are well done  im sure the david lynch 1984 version might have had a few more fans had the special effects been better executed  speaking of the 1984 version i like the acting in it better than the new 2021 version  most all the actors appear too calm for my taste  the atreides hate the harkonnens  the baron is truly despicable and mad  i just dont get the emotion i saw from actors like kenneth mcmillan or patrick stewart in the 1984 outing  2021s version is much more sedated and i think thats a negative for the film  i dont blame the actors  i think this is the directors fault  if it were one or two bad performers it might be the actorsbut this is across the board  this is direction of performances while filmingor at least what was used in the final edit  the only actors i felt really played their roles well were javier bardem and jason momoa  i felt their hatred and their bravery when they were on screen  somaybe part 2 will be a crescendo when it comes out  maybe part 1 was meant to be more subduedto allow emotions to boil and bubble and in part 2 well finally see things burstat least i hope so  dune  part 1 is ok  its not bad but its not as good as it could be  happy viewing
Oct 22 2021,positive,beautiful to look at and spectacular to listen to dune builds an intriguing universe and large cast of characters but ultimately fails to do much with them    read the full review at 
Oct 22 2021,positive,what a great experience jaw dropping throught the movie sound and visuals are sublimevery truthful to frank herberts novelcast is outstanding in their performances a definite must watch for all sci fi fans cant wait for more
Oct 22 2021,positive,incredible execution very true to the book epic scale and outstanding acting
Oct 22 2021,positive,i loved the atmospherics and the overall believeability i was a big fan of the 1984 version and this one was even better likely understandable and very enjoyable by those who have not read dune too i was fascinated by the orthopters the actors who play paul and jessica are imminently watchable hate that it was only part 1 but it allowed more details to come through  cant wait for part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,dune is a modern cinematic masterpiece i saw dune in imax and there was not a sense left unstimulated everything from the sounds to the imagery and the videography was beautifully done i have not read the book yet so i cant tell you how true it is to it but on an online movie review of dune the critic claimes it is quite loyal to the book a few critiques zendaya did not get as much screen time as the advertisements seemed to insinuate there were several events in the movie that were not fully elaborated on and left you wondering too much i think it is also important to note that frank herberts original dune tells the story of the aristocratic and militaristic atreties family and the colonization of arrakis paul is most commonly thought of as a colonizer and attempting to be a white savior but i think the screenwriters and directors did a great job at really making the fremen more of a focal point than previous renditions of the book and films overall i think dune is a movie you have to see at least once in your lifetime and i highly recommend seeing it in theatres specifically imax for the full cinematic experience
Oct 22 2021,positive,a perfect part 1 to frank herberts massive scifi masterpiece  visually stunning scored immaculately and the acting is wonderful  part 2 can not come fast enough
Oct 22 2021,positive,i remember the first time i saw a painting by caravaggio it was david with the head of goliath it was so dark and yet so pristine i immediately fell in love with his paintings they exuded a kind of regality while at the same time being enveloped in these deep black backgrounds which seemed so mysterious this film is the science fantasy version of a caravaggio painting its beautiful yet dark its political intrigue guided by high mysticism its dune and its impossible to turn your eyes away from it as always i quantify the quality of a film on the five essentials of film making  1 writing  dune is the great gatsby of science fantasy its one of those novels that it seems is impossible to adapt correctly because its mostly the author pontificating on lineages the political histories of various planets and the galaxy they are in and high mysticism its more about the ideals rather than the action its hard to make a film about ideals so what we usually get from adaptations is merely the series of acts that take place in the book you get all the plot but none of the deeper meaning this film sadly wasnt that different from the rest its hard but in the end you lose a lot of what makes the book so great you lose the depth but in defense of this film it certainly did a better job than any other adaptation it felt the handling of the bene gesserit was better than the lynch film and certainly far superior to the syfy mini series where the film fell short i felt was its handling of house harkonnen while fully capturing the fact that valdimir harkonnen was evil and repulsive the film played it far to safe to really shock people with how vile this character is in the book the david lynch film got a lot closer but didnt do so with the kind of elegance this film had it was a much glossier take on house harkonnen and perhaps thats due to not wanting to face cancel culture or alienate a wider audience from the film but the film suffers from playing it safe also its an odd structure writing wise i feel this film should have been at least forty minutes shorter and should have been stretched out into three films instead of two the film tells the story of one an a half films and that takes away from it was a film   2 direction   denis villeneuve has woven very tough and stubborn source material into fine silk this is next level filmmaking theres only one part where the film falls short as far as direction is concerned and thats the night ambush on the capital of arrakis it falls short of the scale and scope it should have had but even then it makes up for it in the intimate moments between characters i just wish it had been bigger in scale and had portrayed the kind of scope such a large scale invasion really needed its also a part of the film that felt too short maybe it should have been stretched out and some of the time between paul and jessica in the desert afterwards could have been cut in order to make up for that even still thats a small portion in a two and a half hour film overall i would certainly say that any complaints on direction are ultimately just nitpicking  3 acting   absolutely no complaints there isnt one bad performance in this film everyone is portraying fleshed out characters with a full range of emotions and whos motivations are believable this goes for bit parts and side characters as well this is an amazing cast worthy of being in a film based on source material of this level of grandeur i want to highlight some of the more exceptional performances but to be honest every actor in this film did such a perfect job its just not fair to do so seriously this is high art in the form of science fantasy  4 visual elements   this is a stunning film as i said in my opening statement its a caragaggio painting in the form of a science fantasy film its beautiful whats really amazing is how so much of the tone of the story is told through the visuals the bene gesserit the emperors enclave in the beginning the harkonnens and everything else is just fleshed out perfectly in the costumes and design of the characters it paints a perfect painting of a world of shadows and light theres cryptic costume designs elegant pagentry monsterous villains every detail of every character in this film is executed masterfully the cgi is flawless just flawless the technology is far futurism at its best some of the ships are jaw dropping in scale and design the cinematography is powerful visually speaking its a perfect film  5 scoresoundtrack   another awe inspiring and heart stirring score by hans zimmer truly one of the greatest film score compossers of all time has created yet another masterpiece combining the powerful orchestral elements hes known for as well as exotic rhythms used to build the world of arrakis another masterful score from hans zimmer you really dont need to say anthing more than that     taking a half of a star for some short commings with the script this is a near perfect movie that i believe will inch even closer towards perfection when combined with its second part this is beyond a recommendation this is clearly a dont miss film
Oct 22 2021,positive,this movie was amazing  as much as i didnt want to like itit definitely lives up to the hype  almost everything was spot on  the music the writing the cinematography etc  the only thing that bothered me was the accents of the famous actors and the fact that no one seemed to ever sweat in the movie  other than that great movie  it feel like another lord of the rings trilogy in the making
Oct 22 2021,positive,its a long movie but if im honest i wish it were longer the music the acting the complexity of the story made digestiblewhat a beautiful and meaningful movie loved it  my favorite of the year
Oct 22 2021,positive,easily the best movie of 2021 as a fan of the novels this was just epic stunning visuals the main characters journey to adulthood as he accepts his greater destiny you feel the weight and burden of his great destiny i hope that his is the beginning of a franchise that could be as big as star wars as there is plenty of source material to pull from
Oct 22 2021,positive,a masterpiece    one of the best sci fi films of all time    i absolutely loved it
Oct 22 2021,positive,the look of the overall movie is beautiful as well as the acting and the cast that brings the characters to life and makes you invested in their story
Oct 22 2021,negative,visuals are incredible the rest was boring 
Oct 22 2021,positive,a spectacular film that definitely should be seen on the biggest screen possible 
Oct 22 2021,positive,i have been a dune fan since i first read the book as a child and saw the lynch movie in the 80s denis villenueve has worked a modern miracle with this adaptation the cinematography is gorgeous the details from the book are impeccable the acting is spot on the score fits the setting in unexpected and moving ways there were moments where i almost couldnt breathe at the scale and scope of the film i was transported to another place
Oct 22 2021,positive,its a good looking movie but has problems for people who did not read or enjoy the books may find it confusing and even boring for people who read and enjoyed the books may dislike the changes and omissions of the details that made the dune stories iconic certain characters were not even introduced like irulan and feyd and peitr has very reduced role
Oct 22 2021,positive,beside anythink else in the world this is the best pictures ever
Oct 22 2021,positive,meant for theaters see it in imax cinematography outstanding the world felt lived in
Oct 22 2021,positive,it is an incredible adaptation denis villeneuve did not disappoint it is visually stunning and very well paced exposition of the setting and world details is handled really well the cast all brought their agame long story short go see it
Oct 22 2021,positive,loved this adaptation only a very few and very minor critiques that do not take anything away from this movie i saw this in the theater and went home and watched it again definitely worth your time to see
Oct 22 2021,positive,dune 2021 is visually stunning sadly it doesnt deliver on the story which to me at least is the whole point the dialogue through most of the movie is nothing but noise to fill the silence a fact that is reflected through out most of the scenes of the movies where theres isnt some kind of assault on your ears no subtlety its a beautiful but crude and inaccurate telling of an epic story    do yourself a favor watch dune 1984 its far from perfect but handles the source material in a more elegant manner
Oct 22 2021,positive,spectacular  waiting for the 2nd part
Oct 22 2021,positive,villeneuves dune has strong visuals costumes and designs unfortunately there is not much beyond that part one is a lot of setup without the payoff introducing the story and then ending right as it begins to go somewhere pacing throughout is awkward slow enough to bore in some areas and fast enough to confuse viewers in others with events that are driven by unclear motivations or unexplained background and confusion is amplified by visions of the future that attempt to add mystery but instead make the movie feel like an extended trailer for part two where all the good stuff will supposedly occur having read the book i understood the events that were happening on screen but they were laid out in a disorganized way that didnt flow naturally rather than being driven by the characters and their motives the plot felt moved by an outside force that just wanted to hit all the major points from the book the result is a dizzying string of events with no clear direction or goal defeat the harkonnens prevent the events in pauls visions rebuild spice operations stop the emperor there is no arc to the story no building of anticipation to a climax and resolution and no time taken to build connections with the characters so the events carry no weight the plot is muddled with no milestones to guide its course a problem enhanced by the decision to split the film into two while a smart decision due to the density of the source material the splits execution prevents the first part from standing on its own as a complete film
Oct 22 2021,positive,a nice break from all the action driven blockbusters if the last few years a slow burn with a lot of world building is a fresh change of pace this is a must see in a theater preferably imax because it is one of the most visually stunning movies of the year if not ever
Oct 22 2021,positive,it needs a second look to eliminate the expectation of the great book the disastrous previous film and the hype that carries but when you do that looking at it as a movie itself its good its very good although chamalet does not manage to fully convince as paul
Oct 22 2021,positive,dennis v is the greatest scifi director of our time amazing
Oct 22 2021,positive,wow a good movie was finally allowed to be made how refreshing compared to all the nonsense politically driven flicks that have been dominating over the years of course this movie received great reviews people are starving for good old classic entertainment
Oct 22 2021,positive,very gripping experiencebeautiful cinematography and musiccant wait for part two
Oct 22 2021,positive,an untoppable visual marvel combined with a perfectly paced onceinaliftime theatrical adventure dv keeps up the tension ruthlessly giving a huge credibility to the storyline loving the saga for 20 years on this remake is the best that could ever happen to the first book
Oct 22 2021,positive,masterpiece i got to see an advanced screening of dune and boy was it worth it i had one of the best cinema experiences ive ever had the sheer scale and beauty of this film are truly magnificent every element is executed to perfection and i think dune may be one of if not the most ambitious films i have ever seen every frame is so gorgeous it is a visual masterwork not one single weak performance is present everyone gives it their best with the standouts for me being timothée chalamet and rebecca ferguson  who are excellent the fact that i was practically glued to the screen for the entire runtime speaks volumes storytelling is another one of dunes many feats with its interesting characters unique worldbuilding and a plot that keeps you hooked hanz zimmers score is fantastic as always and it provides a vast feeling of dread and suspense dune may be one of the most important films in my lifetime if continued this film is a new age of scifi cinema please go and watch it please support it we need villeneuve to make more
Oct 22 2021,positive,loved it had to go watch the other adaptations afterwards because it leaves ya hanging right before all the best stuff but excited to see the next one for sure
Oct 22 2021,positive,the best movie of the year by a country mile
Oct 22 2021,positive,i loved how close to the books it was amazing music and scenery the characters were great although it was sometimes hard to hear what they were saying over the background music or they werent annunciating enough i dont regret experiencing it in theaters though i really hope they make the second half of the movie
Oct 22 2021,positive,the movie has a slow opening act with essential world building but i was never bored as it was a visual masterpiece with excellent performances all round from the cast accompanied by so my fascinating things going on screen when the action does hit it was a joy for the eyes and i was sad when it ended if i were to sum the movie up it was a sci fi political intrigue story with a dash of a medieval meets wild west it left me with the same feeling i had after the fellowship of the rings ending sad that its over and im looking forward to part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,i think they a was about as true to the book as it could be makes me want to watch part 2 right now
Oct 22 2021,positive,amazing acting and cinematography
Oct 22 2021,negative,dont get the hype boring and just nothing more than to setup a sequel
Oct 22 2021,positive,it was phenomenal cannot wait until part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,after so long of sciencefiction being a niche prospect 1968s 2001 a space odyssey couldve been another one of those types to be shelved in cinephile archives and comiccon conventions instead it paved the way for more to come like 1977s star wars blade runner ex machina etc even before all of them was a peculiar novel by frank herbert once considered unfilmable the closest we had was childs play tampered by studio interference though it had a worthy director in one david lynch what better ambassador to achieve the impossible this 21st century than denis villeneuve who resurrected another 80s scifi property into the mainstream    with the awardwinning aid of writers jon spaihts and eric roth villeneuves scope translated the first half of the novel with ease it manages to not fall victim to what some part 1part 2 adaptations have in the past actually be a complete story of its own sure it does lean a lot into exposition and character development but theyre the best kind its also sharpened by the best worldbuilding of villeneuves filmography in visuals organic dialogue and oppressive scope hans zimmers score feels like a natural progression from his allencompassing filmography of the 2010s electric synthwaves and earthshattering vibrations juxtaposed to world beats and gregorian chants     dune might have one of the biggest feats for an ensemble cast in a long time and theyre all worth the rave when people look back at which actors exemplified the hottest talent of the timothee chalamets paul atreides has echoes of his 1984 counterpart kyle maclachlan but brings his own spin on the shy warrior jason momoa brings his charisma and sense of humor to duncan idaho pauls brother oscar issac and rebecca ferguson as pauls parents bring chilling warmth and anxiety alongside paul stellan skarsgards villainous vladimir harkonnen is one of several stunning evocations of 1979s apocalypse now sprinkled throughout josh brolin is a worthy successor to patrick stewart as gurney halleck dave bautista and zendaya are also specialized in their smaller roles though dont get too excited as theyre kept to a minimum     denis prospect here fulfills his promise to strike the right balance between being blockbuster game and being true to his arthouse roots and the packed theater i was in was great proof of that heres to hoping that a part 2 and what streaming series that may come will complete the cycle in making frank herberts legacy as canonized as the most legendary of book adaptations the lord of the rings harry potter etc once thought of as unattainable now only halfway there      rating 35 out of 4 stars
Oct 22 2021,positive,dune earns the best review a movie adaptation can receive it felt like the book
Oct 22 2021,positive,outstanding especially if you loved the book
Oct 22 2021,positive,a very slow burn and lacks a lot of action the first act but acting is so on point and its so visually stunning that if you just settle in its worth it costumes fabulous and music is great watched streaming but definitely getting imax tix for the weekend could have used a tiny more jason momoa but imho most things could be improved by more momoa
Oct 22 2021,positive,perfection as a longtime fan of the book series im extremely happy with this adaptation the best film since the matrix finally dune gets the adaptation it deserves see this on the biggest screen possible and see it more than once loved it 
Oct 22 2021,positive,wow walk off homerun a new franchise is born
Oct 22 2021,positive,a bold new chapter in the history of cinema that we needed so badly in the stale cookiecutter mainstream blockbuster landscape the first one of this caliber since the lotr trilogy and mad max fury road im ecstatic that it happens to be an adaptation of my alltime favourite novel wb cant greenilit part 2 nad 3 soon enough
Oct 22 2021,negative,dont understand why this movie is so overhyped 
Oct 22 2021,positive,dune is absolute masterpiece ive read the book and i can say with hinesty this is the most faithful book adaptation that ive ever seen everything was so thrilling and meshmorizing in this movie world building was top notch actors were superbly cast music score is most likely hans zimmers mangnum opus aptmoshere was totaly capturing and unique great respect for denis villeneuve
Oct 22 2021,positive,i went having not read any of the books and i left dying to read them all the world building is amazing phenomenal casting beautiful cinematography and another epic score from hans zimmer the pacing is slow but its supposed to be cant wait for the next one
Oct 22 2021,positive,first review on rotten tomatoes but felt compelled to say this is an awesome movie and dune could be as big as star trek and star wars they have to make part ii and beyond this is a must see movie
Oct 22 2021,positive,i thought the cgi was great   however teh sound effects i thought were going to blow the speakers out of my sound bar   i have hbo max and glad that i was able to watch it that way paying to go see this disaster of a film would have not been cool  i guess i prefer the original dune movie at least that one had characters we could love to watch  this movie had well so real casting mistakes  whoever picked the guy who played paul really blew it he does not come off as anything other than a brat  i have to say they made a good casting call with  gurney and with duncan  the duke not so much  rayban was also a good call  however the rest of the cast just seam to be phoning it in and not trying  and what is up with stilgar he supposed to be the best fighter on dune other than paul and he seams to be the weak point
Oct 22 2021,positive,it takes a minute  or even a rewatch to really get it
Oct 22 2021,positive,loved it going to buy the book 
Oct 22 2021,positive,incredible never read the book but this is amazing on the scale of lord of the rings in epic fantasy
Oct 22 2021,positive,there was a lack of clarity when it came to explaining the world of dune and the many nuances of life in that world only people who have read the book or seen the first movie knew what was going on in the plot
Oct 22 2021,positive,not only is this now the definitive adaptation of dune this is among the best science fiction films ever made the one and only downside now we have to wait for part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,great movie very true to the story great acting by the main people and special effects that were top of the line the only down side is waiting for the next one
Oct 22 2021,positive,a great adaption of the book which like the film  can be a bit dense on occasion but overall leaves you intrigued and fulfilled
Oct 22 2021,positive,the movie is gorgeously shot and the score is excellent as someone who read the book i thought it was a very faithful adaptation but it can be a bit slow at time if i was not familiar with the source material i can see how it might be a bit confusing overall though i thought it was a very well made enjoyable film
Oct 22 2021,positive,if david lynchs and denis villeneuves dune movies could have a baby then wed have a great movie as is we have one really soso movie and one decent movie for all the grief lynchs dune gets and deserves it did get through a relatively familiar story albeit taking unnecessary liberties over its runtime it succeeded at being imaginative in its own right and being weird yes the dune series is weird get over it it just is it failed at being epic and it failed at creating characters the audience felt connected to on the over hand villeneuves dune is the opposite its not weird with one unnecessary exception but it is epic it takes unnecessarily long to not get through a simple plot but we care about the characters im totally cool with there being a part 2 im just not convinced this couldnt have been done better in a single movie
Oct 22 2021,positive,true to the book  this film correctly depicts the vastness and size of the capital ships and landscape of arrakkis sardaurkar are scary the barons levitation is intimidating excellent acting by all
Oct 22 2021,negative,wow and you give lynch shit this movie is a genuine faliure
Oct 22 2021,positive,i will do my best to watch dune on the big screen i watched it on hbo max and it is way to nice to just watch on the small screen  i have to admit that i did have reservations with the gender swap with the character of doctor liet kynes however sharon duncanbrewster made the role her own and did i much more believable job in the role than max von sydow or karel dobry did in the role as kynes in their respective versions of dune i am not taking anything away from the two actors that came before sharon duncanbrewster but she nailed it i can say after watching this version of doctor kynes that the gender swap was the right choice denis villeneuve impressed me with his take on the blade runner universe and with this movie he knocked it out of the park if i could pick a director to make my life story into a movie denis villeneuve would be the person villeneuve made the right choice in breaking the book down into two parts i just hope the second part lives up to the first part timothée chalamet looks and feels more like the paul atreides of the book he does not come off like the cocky selfrighteous paul atreides of the other two versions zendaya in the role of chani was off the chain dont get me wrong i liked sean young as chani in the 1984 dune and barbora kodetova in the 2000 miniseries zendaya just had a better script and proved that she could pull off the role now on to jason momoa as duncan idaho in all truth i think he was born to play this role i have enjoyed his acting in everything from game of thrones to now the role of duncan idaho is his best role to date i do admit that momoa without facial hair in later parts of the movie was lets just say it was just weird    i could go on and on about how great the cast was for this movie but i just wanted to hit the points that stuck out in my mind plus this post would be as long a novel if i tried to go into detail on how everyone did a great job in their roles i am might stray into spoilers if i did so i am going to end this post with if you enjoy a great scifi adventure with toplevel worldbuilding i say check this film out
Oct 22 2021,positive,one thing i had a problem with was stilgars accent either he should have had no accent  like all the other fremont or they should have had his accent
Oct 22 2021,positive,loved this faithful adaptation loved the cast visuals score filming locations everything i was hoping for barely noticed the 25hour runtime
Oct 22 2021,positive,with beautiful visuals and extraordinary storytelling this movie is a mustsee in cinema  both for fans and those like me that have never read the books
Oct 22 2021,positive,magnificent a new hope not since the original star wars have we stood on the edge of a new universe and been so transfixed i hate most new adaptations as my reviews attest to yet this is bona fide wonderous piece of film making on all fronts writing acting editing cinematography art direction sound dont change or screw up the next one
Oct 22 2021,positive,i have seen it twice now
Oct 22 2021,positive,i like the style the barron fit the style but wasnt as villainous as the first one batista didnt have any enemies there was no reason to be scared of them i hope zendeya starts dating timothée in real life i didnt realize that it said part one
Oct 22 2021,positive,brilliant on all counts a modern masterpiece completely immersive and beautifully made
Oct 22 2021,positive,a massive cinematic masterpiece in the making that mirrors the scale and scope of herberts own inspiration lawrence of arabia the perfect framing of paul as a flawed messiah hits every theme that the phantom menace failed to
Oct 22 2021,positive,awesome best visual version yet  great sound track
Oct 22 2021,positive,hans zimmer absolutely killed in a great way the score awesome visuals well worth the wait
Oct 22 2021,positive,dune is everything the 15 year old me reading the book for the first time could have hoped it would be loyal to the source material well cast and one of the most visually stunning movies i have seen
Oct 22 2021,positive,immersive and jarring i cant imagine a better adaptation of the source material the exposition is subtle but does what it needs to do i cannot understand reviewers complaints about the ending you need to cut the novel in half or suffer a 4 hour movie and they chose the only real place to do it and portrayed it beautifully  with a little tease in the dialogue this is only the beginning its the spot where our hero is about to make a big transition from one world into a new one flawless i cannot fault this movie in any respect i loved everything about it for me the standout actors are ferguson chalamet and momoa but there were no subpar performances from this stacked cast a
Oct 22 2021,positive,amazing acting stunning visual effects music was top tier  cant wait to see sequel
Oct 22 2021,positive,not bad the cinematography is amazing and the cast is doing a great job they need to make a second one because the ending was a bit abrupt
Oct 22 2021,positive,absolutely what i was hoping for as a life long science fiction lover and reader of the dune books  the movie is breath taking but comes down to the personal level and my only complaint is they didnt do a 10 hour movie to begin with  i was expecting it to end midbook but even though i was sad to see it end by the end i was so grateful id seen it on a big screen  i will be going back to see it on the biggest imax screen  a few beautiful moving moving portraits rival 2001 in their grandeur and scope  sometimes it takes concentration to see the full picture and i do not see how some of these sites can be given full force on most big screens at home  i will be extremely hostile if they want us to wait years for the follow up  they will the the backing and profits to do the sequel right away and they better strike while the iron is hot  it is a gigantic enterprise and i even dare to say it is the star wars heir of the 21st century  and the most exciting parts of the first book is only beginning with equally tremendous sequels to the novel that us fans followed with ravenous appetites when the came out                ab
Oct 22 2021,positive,second time round i really enjoyed it a lot more than the first time the film was epic more stuff happened than what people say i think but it set up well for the part 2 the cinematography was brilliant as always really liked the cast while timothee character was a bit stale i still liked him
Oct 22 2021,positive,stoked for the next installment
Oct 22 2021,positive,as a huge fan of the book this movie adaptation is what ive been waiting for flawless execution but now i need part 2
Oct 22 2021,neutral,very disappointed its a very very modern movie all visuals and emotions without real content or substance   you learn more about the story in the first five minutes of david lynchs version than you do the entire movie   the emperor is behind the scenes but you have clue to who he is no clue   other than paul and jessica the characters are thin   sardaurkar who why are they important no clue   the handinthebox scene lacks intensity real pain its an incredibly important scene to understand paul and his future odyssey but the movie doesnt show it because lynch did it in his   dr yueh a major character has little to no background you feel no empathy for him you cant even understand him as he speaks   the movie inserts bits and pieces of the book with minor scenes trying to glue them together without proper context   the value of the movie is that is it mostly visual obviously trying to wow the audience with special effects what it lacks is substance the very thing that makes us think which is the entirety of herberts book and the attempt in lynchs very complicated movie
Oct 22 2021,positive,the world building in this film is incredible ground breaking the music by hans zimmer is epic the visuals are stunning its pretty close to how i pictured it from the book 
Oct 22 2021,positive,visually the movie is stunning it properly feels like a scifi film     where the movie lacks is pacing screens drag on too long or too short the audience never has the opportunity to take in the characters or the settings long enough at many points the film fails to explain or show why a character acts how they do it fails to inform the audience why the characters are where they are and fails to explain why the technology is the way that it is     overall it is a great piece of art to look at but without knowing the source material its going to be a boring and dull affair 35 stars
Oct 22 2021,positive,one of the few movies that exist at all with the intention of telling the source story while also transcending the experience as well as the art of film making 3     i adore dune this film was earnest brilliance
Oct 22 2021,positive,incredible go out and see it in theaters best dune adaptation there will probably ever be everyone nails there role the action is great denis did a great job
Oct 22 2021,positive,it has been years since a movie has touched me like this  with no knowledge of the dune story i jumped in blind  i am now invested in this story and wanting more just as the movie ends  everyone is entitled to their opinion but those who do not say this movie is captivating well balanced and emotional you truly have lost touch with cinema  acting is a production a effects a  watched on hbomax on release and now plan on seeing in the theaters because this movie will make you realize this is one to see on the big screen but you can ingest on streaming first to draw you in
Oct 22 2021,positive,i wanted to see part two now the scale was epic the characters well cast yes i was comparing key scenes to the book and the original movie but that was part of the fun for me too
Oct 22 2021,neutral,dune is my favorite book series so i had high expectations the movie started out very well with the plot and dialogue staying true to the novel the story was engaging and majestic staying true to frank herberts vision unfortunately the plot lost momentum by the second half of the movie turning dull and boring i felt that those new to the franchise would be extremely confused by what was going on this movie was primarily created for the dune fanbase leaving newcomers confused im also disappointed that they ended in the middle of the first book without any current funding or concrete filming plans for a sequel a halffinished work deserves half the stars i have to say though that the scene with paul and the worm was probably my favorite the visual effects carry this movie
Oct 22 2021,positive,i have always felt the dune story like combination of star wars game or thrones and tremors and i enjoyed seeing it on the big screen its definitely a great movie loved the cinematography and hans zimmer score the movie nailed it to adapt perfectly the first half of the book  the ending left me with the need to see a sequel i hope they do it
Oct 22 2021,positive,nice visual spectacle but the slow pace makes me lose interest the ending was anticlimactic and theres just no draw to a sequel which im sure in the making
Oct 22 2021,negative,so being dune fans at 5pm we sat down to our sammies and watched dune we talked shit through the whole movie it is pretty like blade runner but they took serious liberties with the book the deep conversations are gone all the inner thoughts which adds context of the situation and how the characters feel about each other all gone i could go on for hours why this movie is shit and changes fate to a forced plan if i walked in without any dune knowledge i guess it would be a decent movie i feel they spent 2 hours skipping and rearranging the story and no character building for context i have read the full series from butlerian jihad to sandworms of dune 3 times and the original books i have lost count
Oct 22 2021,negative,visually great but storyline
Oct 22 2021,positive,as a lifelong fan of the book series the original not the one authored by brian herbert this is the dune movie i have been waiting for  everything from the casting to the cinematography to the translation from book to screen is done so beautifully and with obvious love for the material  it feels as sweeping as scope as some of the older hollywood movies ben hur lawrence of arabia and shows why stories in the star trek and star wars universes were inspired by the concepts in dune    heres hoping that we get part 2 of this story and many more movies in the dune universe to come
Oct 22 2021,positive,thoroughly enjoyed it
Oct 22 2021,positive,fantastic first part of hopefully the next big trilogy this movie is truly epic and feels massive in scale cant recommend it enough
Oct 22 2021,positive,amazing loses a half of a star cause i wasnt ready for the story to end
Oct 22 2021,positive,great fastpaced 25 hours  stuck very closely to the book first half  cant wait for part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,denis at his absolute best building beautiful massive oppressive worlds
Oct 22 2021,positive,i first read the dune book when i was a teenager and it became probably my favorite book it is refreshing to finally see a worthy adaptation denis villeneuves version of the story is breathtaking with amazing production design and cinematography which works especially well in the imax format it should definitely be seen at least once in this format and not on hbo max where it will also be released next month the casting is spot on and the film does an excellent job with the material the film wisely does not attempt to cover the entire book in the film stopping around halfway through the source material and hopefully it will do well enough to get us the promised part two  the film takes its time with the narrative allowing us to experience the water planet of caladan played by norway before moving to the desert world of arrakis played by jordan and the uae the political intrigue and warring great space houses are present but they keep paul timothée chalamet center for most of the film as we see events through his eyes and his visions of the future hint at what will happen in the second part as well as some events from the following books  really i very much enjoyed this film and strongly recommend it
Oct 22 2021,positive,as a fan who read all the books this is by far the best
Oct 22 2021,negative,terrible boring unfinished
Oct 22 2021,positive,very entertaining very interesting and very satisfying must see
Oct 22 2021,positive,immersive movie  if i had to come up with something negative to comment on it would be some of the modern dialogue that snuck its way in  this is the only thing that broke the spell for me
Oct 22 2021,positive,there has never been a film like this before so epic and sprawling in its scope andin a wayits detachment from sentimental individualism dune perfectly captures the essence of herberts novel and sets the stage for a muchneeded critique of the charisma of powerful men dune is humanity seen writ large with none of the emphasis on allowing us to identify with characters that we might expect one thing is certain cinema will never be the same again after dune
Oct 22 2021,negative,this movie was unimaginably slow and could have easily been condensed into a much more interesting faster paced film that would have left viewers craving more instead it was a boring forgetful film that moved at an absolute crawl
Oct 22 2021,positive,best movie ive seen in the last 5 years oh my gosh what a thrilling ride i never wanted to see a movie continue more than dune i dont want to stop watching
Oct 22 2021,positive,see it on the biggest screen aka imax if you can the visuals were beautifully done and the pacing of the story just flies on by
Oct 22 2021,positive,liked  very true to the book characters are well developed  disliked  scenes seemed stretched for effect but it didnt work  too many pregnant pauses that were too long  music was way too loud and overbearing  dialog could not be heard over the music in many scenes  brief scenes that made no sense scattered throughout military planet scene in particular    overall i enjoyed the movie but it would have been better with some judicious editing
Oct 22 2021,positive,visually stunning character and stories were hallow
Oct 22 2021,positive,such a beautifully done movie so happy technology was finally advanced enough to make this happen immersive  epic probably will surpass sagas like star wars
Oct 22 2021,positive,the ongoing criticism of not too much personality given to characters is a legitimate gripe but the film trades out that running time for what is perhaps the books strongest characteristic fantastic world building with the stage set for a chess not checkers showdown
Oct 22 2021,positive,one of the most beautiful movies that i ever seen the visuals the soundsit makes think of the golden age of cinema and epic movies like gone with the wind benhur the ten comandments perfectly cast from timothee chalamets performance from heir prince to forced leader of the opposition to mightmarish stellan skargards baron if you can see it in movie theaters and imax denis villeneuve his crew and cast created a masterpiecei will tell you why you get to care about the characters and their fates you spent 25 hours not getting bored instead you are interested on the lore story and characters background and development i was bedazzled by the imagesthe music with its middle eastern influences and you want more the best way to qualify a productit puts you to thinkto think how ecological resources are mined out of the expence of nature and the local indigenous people how the rich and powerful are willing to crush those beneath them and kill among them to become more rich and powerful even and how religious groups within the power spheres create meshias mythos and prophecies to give the masses something to hope for while they spend their lives serving their masters as disposable tools in their schemes i recommend it not to see once but many times understand the message and support itand maybe like the fremen expected their muadibwe can expect good story telling coming back to cinemas
Oct 22 2021,positive,loved the movie after a whole got something this exciting
Oct 22 2021,positive,dune 2021 is clearly watchable and has a number of strong points especially its cast but i clearly prefer denis villeneuves vision as a director with sicario versus the overlong and overplayed directorial style evidenced by blade runner 2049 and dune 2021
Oct 22 2021,positive,finally an adaptation worthy of the book visually stunning incredibly cast and directed the only negative is that i cant watch the second half right now hopefully it gets fast tracked
Oct 22 2021,positive,a movie that needs to be seen on the big screen
Oct 22 2021,positive,i wish i knew this was just about 13 of the storyline  i was expecting the entire dune story so that was a bit of a letdown overall gorgeous film but it felt too dim much of the time basically zero color in the film and the soundtrack was a bit heavy  i get the effect they were going for but it came to the forefront of the consciousness too often instead of keeping you in the film casting was strong  lietkynes was not the best choice imo  not a strong enough presence to convince us of this powerful leader t chalamet was perfect hopefully they will release the next segment within a few months
Oct 22 2021,positive,perfect as close to the book as possible
Oct 22 2021,positive,this movie brings to reality what star wars fans thought that franchise would be
Oct 22 2021,positive,epic in scope which amazing visuals rousing score and excellent acting
Oct 22 2021,positive,great part onenow where is part two 
Oct 22 2021,positive,visually stunning movie that finally gives the attention and detail this epic book deserves the movie takes the time to explain the complex world of dune and prepare you for the journey to comein part 2 be prepared for no real end to this movie as it only covers about half of book 1 while the split was a logical decision it can be disappointing to sit through such a long movie with no resolution if you want to continue the journey watch the scifi mini series
Oct 22 2021,positive,i am a huge fan of the books having readaudible them many times so i was worried that the movie might turn out to be underwhelming i watched the movie last night and i was mesmerized the movie follows the book very closely the minor changes only help improve the accessibility of the complex story visuals and music are superb overall i loved the movie and will be rewatching it now looking forward to part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,best picture of the year
Oct 22 2021,positive,lovely to watch and listen to relatively faithful to the book although i missed the lack of character definition of the mentats overall not bad but there seemed to be too much emphasis on the portrayal of the environment and cool shots and not enough on emotion and any sort of joy
Oct 22 2021,positive,i absolutely loved this the cinematography is gorgeous and all actors involved really give it their best and it shows i felt absolutely immersed in the duniverse and honestly cannot wait for the next part one of the most elegant cliffhangers first parts of a story ever
Oct 22 2021,positive,it was phenomenal amazing cast soundtrack cgis very impressed
Oct 22 2021,positive,so true to the book i can only think of 3 notable exclusions but it didnt take away from the story it felt very smart in how it taught the complex lord elements the score was incredible i left beyond satisfied
Oct 22 2021,positive,it exceed my expectations i cant wait for part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,similar to the book its slow moving but once the action starts it grabs you and wont let go  cant wait til the next one
Oct 22 2021,positive,dune does an excellent job of adapting the complexity of the source material to the big screen   it is also visually stunning     this is the rare example where the movie lives up to the hype  the characters are cast perfectly  i particularly liked stellan skarsgards portrayal of the baron which seemed like a combination of col walter e kurtz and king lear
Oct 22 2021,positive,this movie did not disappoint stunning and i cannot wait for part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,i just watch this as soon as it was on hbo max omg im going to the theater now to see it cant wait for part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,my heart couldnt stop racing   this is the most faithful adaptation of frank herberts work that has ever been created the fight scenes are epic the philosophical moral and social message is beautiful and unpretentious the dialogue is engaging entertaining and informing and the cinematography is unlike anything ive ever seen the music is like it is from another world as is the set and the props like never before i have felt transported to another world bravo to the entire cast and bravo to their absolutely remarkable visionary director
Oct 22 2021,positive,obvious respect for the original material  while there are a few cringe moments regarding how the source was modified they are by far outweighed by the majority of the film and do not detract  cant wait for part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,a visual masterpiece one of the best films of 2021
Oct 22 2021,positive,great movie  cant wait to see the conclusion to the story
Oct 22 2021,positive,youll love it i cant wait for dune two 
Oct 22 2021,positive,a great movie you can feel the influence of david lynch in almost every aspect of this film the ending leaves you begging for more great movie cant wait for the rest
Oct 22 2021,negative,the movie has no clear story while being way too long
Oct 22 2021,positive,was a great experience at the imax the bit they went into the storm was amazing felt like i was in there with them best sci fi film ive ever seen so excited for part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,one of the few times a movie lived up to the long awaited hype
Oct 22 2021,positive,best visual representation of the book thus far   stunning visuals and staying true to the story
Oct 22 2021,positive,the most faithful adaptation of the book to date and just a masterpiece in filmmaking it should really be enjoyed in a theater
Oct 22 2021,positive,a truly immersive scifi spectacle crafted by the top people in the industry epic in every way
Oct 22 2021,positive,this adaptation of the famed frank herbert novel is masterful working its way up to the transformation of paul atriedes to his eventual position of leader of he fremen and arrakis was a great decision since there is so much in the novel to depict screen looking forward to part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,cool story cool visuals
Oct 22 2021,negative,this 25hr movie could have been over in 20 minutes  it plods along very slowly with way too many dream sequences that are as redundant as deliberately vague
Oct 22 2021,positive,this is a movie is classic in every way from the production design to the writing acting direction and music this is one of the best science fiction movies that i have ever seen incredible and unmissable
Oct 22 2021,positive,great movie for fans of the books  did not pander or try to explain everything to newcomers left room for audience to think and wonder while serving up intense big screen action visually satisfying superb casting cant wait for part 2 and hopefully more
Oct 22 2021,positive,i thought it was a excellent retelling of the first part of the book
Oct 22 2021,positive,please make the next movie really well done in line with the book masterful
Oct 22 2021,positive,a coworker referenced the 1984 dune by saying he didnt understand it at all  based on the complicated source material trying to capture the right tone to be true to herberts work it is easy in retrospect to see how it fell into a stylish quagmire of jumbled plot that lost the point  villeneuves dune balances the mythos and ethereal quality needed for the books fanbase with a straight forward storyline that is as old as time greed lust for power and jealousy and the willingness to oppress others to achieve and maintain it  its a masterful balancing act and he pulls it off  its stunning visually and the actors own their characters jason momoa made the most of his relatively minor role but it is only an opening chapter and cannot stand alone as a single movie  therefore i think it might frustrate some who just want an evening out at the movies but fans of the franchise will relish it
Oct 22 2021,positive,great  cant wait for part 2
Oct 22 2021,neutral,well i think movies are dead
Oct 22 2021,positive,a glorious adaption see it on the biggest screen with the best sound system you can find the cinematography score make for an immersive experience
Oct 22 2021,positive,absolutely awesome worth every penny better than the original movie and mini series its about time thus book was done justice and this movie did it
Oct 22 2021,negative,its a decent movie but unfulfilling since its only the first part of a movie and who knows whenif part 2 is coming
Oct 22 2021,positive,after i got pass the half a movie than not bad
Oct 22 2021,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed the movie it was visually stunningi look forward to the next installment
Oct 22 2021,positive,finally dune faithful to the book in story line character development and themes part 1 sets the world of dune as frank herbert intended casting decisions are impressive costumes are very effective arrakis and its sandworms are aweinspiring there is so much story to tell but no scene is wasted and the 2 12 hours is well used dune fans rejoice
Oct 22 2021,positive,slower than molasses in january that being said im excited for where its going beautifully shot wish johan johannes was still alive to compose this one zimmer is great per usual but villaneuve had something special with johannes 
Oct 22 2021,positive,the very best blockbuster film that ive seen in at least five years dune is a brilliant translation of frank herberts novel that should appeal to die hards and general audiences alike i cant wait for part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,denis villineuve has adapted the classic science fiction novel with perfection the detail of the visuals and the gravity of the characters work together in a perfect slow burn to make any science fiction fan squirm with excitement
Oct 22 2021,positive,dunes world is immersive displaying intense music and cinematography  however the pace is slow and steady  leaving the runtime feeling long with some fighting seemingly choreographed and unnatural  get in a room full of speakers and blast off
Oct 22 2021,positive,absolutely fantastic
Oct 22 2021,positive,visually stunning the cast is amazing and the characters didnt feel out of place for any one of them i cant even imagine watching the 1980s make of this movie this one is something you cant unsee or would want to an all time favorite for me hands down instant fan
Oct 22 2021,positive,fantastic  i was sceptical that this dune movie could exceed the syfy version  i was wrong this movie is epic  i know others have said it but it is at least as epic as the lord of the rings   definitely want to see part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,amazing  go see this at an imax if you can  the visuals in this movie were fantastic  i sincerely hope denise gets a best director award  at the very least someone should get best cinematographer  and it was faithful to the book  i was very glad to see them add scenes that the other versions left out  rebecca ferguson was fantastic as lady jessica  she was cast perfectly  and timothy nailed it as a young paul  he was brooding and moody and deeply affected by his visions    cant wait for part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,i love it  its way better than the 1984 version in both story telling and visual experience and the gorgeous set the enormous desert with its rich texture and color is sensually seductive  one cant fault the movie for ending abruptly as the book has been divided into two parts hence dune part i was displayed at the beginning of the movie  now the studio needs to do the right thing and green light part two
Oct 22 2021,positive,it was so awesome and a little scary
Oct 22 2021,positive,this is visually the best villenueve film to date storywise it has one issue this story is totally dependant on a sequel which is the original idea so it makes sense but if this movie doesnt do well and they cancel the sequel it will be an incomplete story    that being said go to the cinema with the biggest screen and you will not be dissapointed it totally deserves it
Oct 22 2021,positive,dune features a very vast and intricateuniverse that doesnt waste time holding your hand i encourage watching the extra content hbo has first to give you a few reference points i felt a little confused at a few points but upon watching again i followed along much better i loved the movie and im very curious about what more they have in store for us
Oct 22 2021,positive,slow development of the story
Oct 22 2021,positive,i loved this movie with every fiber of my being as a book lover there are things that feel slightly rushed there are characters who i wish could be more fleshed out there are slight pacing issues all together they do not dim what is such a profound cinematic experience the casting the acting the world building the dialog the score are all just downright incredible 1010
Oct 22 2021,positive,a superb adaptation of gargantuan proportions a must see
Oct 22 2021,positive,still mesmerized and awestruck a day later the wide spaces and huge sets in the imax are spellbounding
Oct 22 2021,positive,i was eagerly engaged from the first minute of the film  timothée chalamet does an outstanding job of showing a much greater depth in the lead character paul atreides  this film was much richer than the 1984 classic and my only complaint is that it ended too early  the next 12 dune films will shown an even more to enjoy  9 of 10
Oct 22 2021,positive,cinematographically beautiful with amazing score and standout performances dune is a must watch film of 2021 and looks to be a start to breathtaking epic that will come in future
Oct 22 2021,positive,wow what an epic film imax is the only way to see this
Oct 22 2021,positive,villeneuves work should be appreciated in its full splendor truthful to the source material this movie is packed with the appropriate amount of epic action and drama the actors performances are stellar the music is exceptional this movie is putting the latest installments of another great space opera series inspired by this one to shame
Oct 22 2021,positive,an absolute masterpiece and a perfect adaptation of the book highly recommend watching it in imax or at least a theater the visuals and acting were stunning
Oct 22 2021,positive,dune is epic  it is where george lucas stole all his ideas for star wars  dune 2021 is serious star wars for adults dune is basically luke skywalker suave  i will watch this movie over and over awesome
Oct 22 2021,positive,this is an epic movie stunning cinematography landscapes that are beautiful and impressive fantastic visual effects great casting which results in characters with depth and all in all the start of hopefully a sequel that we can look forward to fast
Oct 22 2021,positive,just left the theater and loved it having read the book several times i understood that the first 150 pages were a slow build to what was an extremely action packed second half  the pacing will seem a little slow to some people but to try and get the whole book into 3 hours would have required making a lesser quality film once the second movie comes out this will be seen as one of the greatest scifi film collections
Oct 22 2021,positive,best high budget movie since hunger games as well an adaptation i felt like i was being introduced to middle earth and the wizarding world wainting for pt ii
Oct 22 2021,positive,this was a great movie that is so far a fantastic remake it was so nice to watch a movie that wasnt trying to shove some heavy handed political agenda in your face for a change this movie allows its story to entertain and the audience to draw their own introspections from it breath of fresh air and cant wait for the second one
Oct 22 2021,positive,came into the movie completely blind having not read the source or seen the lynch film i thought it was great 
Oct 22 2021,positive,beautiful film one of the most visually impressive things ive ever seen the music is outstanding and is arguably even better than the already masterful visuals everything about the movie just works from the writing and acting to the choreography in the fight scenes must watch
Oct 22 2021,positive,incredible experience see it in theaters
Oct 22 2021,positive,for the movie dune i followed the plea from the filmmaker to see it on the largest screen possible at the imax it was not disappointing in that the cinematics are amazing the scale of the world is impressive and the ships and worms are just huge i am happy that this was the theater experience i was hoping for    on the heels of reading frank herberts dune this movie shocked me throughout at how well it followed the story portrayed pauls visions the political tension emotion and even the voice the scenes in the movie seem to be follow the book almost bitbybit    every scene in dune felt important and the only negative thing i have to say about it is where this film ends i understood going into it that this is only part one but it was still felt abrupt when the camera backed up the music increased and then the credits rolled i am very much looking forward to part two and will travel back to the imax for that one as well
Oct 22 2021,positive,it was very well done left you wanting part two and the acting was superb
Oct 22 2021,positive,dune is literally a spiritual experience after i seen it i dreamed about it all night last night it is unlike anything
Oct 22 2021,positive,visually it is breathtaking and awe inspiring this is just the beginning to hopefully more of us visiting arrakis denis villanueve has created one of the best scifi epics ever and he did a blade runner 2049 which was epic on its own merits 
Oct 22 2021,neutral,great cast and gorgeous movie but it didnt need to be that slow and that long
Oct 22 2021,positive,in a word breathtaking in more words incredibly well paced beautiful shots and little needless exposition theres enough for those who havent read the book to know what is going on mind you but this is done right the dune we needed part 2 must flow
Oct 22 2021,positive,i havent read the novel before the movie presents an attractive world setting that make you curious the plot is a bit cliche but its understandable since its just part one looking forward to the sequels
Oct 22 2021,positive,stunning and worth every moment the only downside is well have to wait 2 years to get part 2 go watch it now
Oct 22 2021,positive,the movie was great entertaining all the way great sceneries costumes and production as whole they scoring was fantastic saw it in a titan luxe with dolby atmosphere sound epic cant wait until part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,an absolute epic in the making with great performances an awe inspiring soundtrack incredible visuals and an impeccable show of storytelling youd be depriving yourself if you dont see this in theaters its made for the big screen
Oct 22 2021,positive,dvs incredible ambition pays off with a very faithful and yet innovative adaptation of a very difficult piece of source material the beautiful cinematography and the outstanding sound design makes this one worth going to the cinema to experience as a fan of the books i was delighted
Oct 22 2021,positive,an absolutely beautiful movie and a wonderful adaptation of the book well done
Oct 22 2021,positive,this movie is a masterpiece from its visuals soundtrack performances world building writing pacing action direction every scene gave me chills see it on the big screen
Oct 22 2021,positive,phenomenal adaptation of the sci fi epic its not so much a movie you watch as its something you experience truly one of the best science fiction movies ever and without question the best movie of the year so far go see it on the biggest screen with the loudest sound system its a once in a lifetime movie event
Oct 22 2021,positive,love everything about this version hopefully we would get a sequel  this is too good to be left unfinished 
Oct 22 2021,positive,epic moving and masterfully done
Oct 22 2021,positive,very close to the book and great visual effects
Oct 22 2021,positive,breathtaking the best book to movie adaptation ive ever seen the score acting and cinematography were unbelievable
Oct 22 2021,negative,its a visually stunning movie no doubt  cinematography costume design sets etc etc all that stuff is fantastic however for me the movie was incredibly boring with forgettable characters and dialogue that runs flat based on other reviews ive read it seems that if you have read the dune novel which i havent then the movie will be viewed with much greater adoration  having said that i dont agree i should have to read the source material for me to enjoy the movie  the story should be told on the big screen without need to refer to the reference material  so im giving this 2 stars out of 5 because it is a visual treat that entirely lacks entertainment
Oct 22 2021,positive,such an improvement over the original doing first half of book only made sense you cant squeeze 800 pages into 3 hours if you read the books you will love the movie if not you may find it slow not to worry though as the second half of the book is where the action picks up lets just hope they receive enough at the box office to continue the series
Oct 22 2021,positive,great world building great visuals great soundtrackmusic throughout excited to see whats to come phenomenal performances across the board as well
Oct 22 2021,positive,hard to describe how epic this movie is needs to be seen on the big screen
Oct 22 2021,positive,everything you could ask for even better than his blade runner adaptation
Oct 22 2021,positive,exceptional cinematography and acting 1110
Oct 22 2021,positive,some parts they stayed very close to the book the copters and equipmentbut in places they went away from the book giving lines to the wrong character some characters have not been introduced yet it was enjoyable but they could have used narration to explain parts
Oct 22 2021,positive,a perfect bit of filmmaking better plotted produced and shot that just about any recent big budget movie ive seen
Oct 22 2021,positive,visually appealing decently played beautiful thematic music nice adaptation of the book the only problem for me really doubt that for others also is that it feels like an action flick and i remember that story being full with philosophical and moral dilemmas prolly the second part will be leaning heavier on that side or not we shall see another small thing taking me aback was that it was full of known actors but they did a good job still i would prefer seeing a new face or two
Oct 22 2021,positive,memorizing cinematography otherworldly score incredible sound design as a fan of the novel i dont think you could hope for a better beginning half of the story so we better get that second part
Oct 22 2021,positive,just might be the greatest sf epic ever the book finally translated to film reverently and with artistic mastery
Oct 22 2021,positive,face against your fear
Oct 22 2021,positive,beautiful  couldnt adapt the book any better
Oct 22 2021,positive,an absolute must see film although some people find it boring i never once found myself not enjoying ehat i was seeing
Oct 22 2021,positive,i agree with the reviewers that this is a visually stunning movie but its also somewhat of a bore to be honest i actually like the original movie better even though it was also a bit boring also this is the first in a twopart movie
Oct 22 2021,negative,would only watch it if you want to stare at the cast    the cast was immaculate the acting was amazing the cinematography was absolutely beautiful and the directing was perfect    the plot however was worryingly bad for such a bigbudget movie with such bigname actors the plot was lacking they spent the entirety of the movie building up the sequel completely throwing away any value the climax wouldve added dont get me wrong im not a professional movie critic or anything im a teenage girl and even i know the movie was objectively bad we didnt get to see the huge climax of the movie and the emperor was in it for one scene i fell asleep for half an hour of the movie and missed absolutely nothing it was so slowmoving and the only reason id watch it again is to stare at the cast zendaya especially in her 10 minutes max of screen time     hugely disappointed with this movie especially when it was so hyped up because of the cast it is 100 not the actors fault that the movie was bad and the only reason im not rating it lower is because of the look of the movie     would not waste my money watching it if i were you definitely not rewatchable
Oct 22 2021,positive,great movie cant wait for two
Oct 22 2021,positive,movie had some great cinematography and had a decent set up for characters a small part of the film was a little slow but over all was a great movie i would recommend
Oct 22 2021,positive,an absolute cinematic masterpiece they will be talking about for decades to come
Oct 22 2021,positive,amazing adaptation of frank herberts novel truly an amazing feat of directorial prowes many tried and failed villeneuve succeeded  straight from page to screen watch it in a big imax screen   understand that this ends  midways  and trust me if you are unfamiliar youll want to see the conclusion alas in todays industry the conclusion to a most perfect work is held hostage to box office success
Oct 22 2021,positive,visually and narratively stunning as expected with a perfect worldencompassing tonesetting score from han zimmer for a casual viewer of dune this is highly accessible and highly recommendable if a little overlong in its approach
Oct 22 2021,positive,we liked the overall feel and gravity of the movie and the actors portrayal
Oct 22 2021,positive,if you read the book this movie its a powerful translation the emotion atmosphere sre there its not a perfect one but it comes close the scope its astonishing kudos to mr villeneuve for this brave endeavor
Oct 22 2021,negative,missed key scenesreminded me of the first movienot enough explanationto people who havent read the books probably thought it was a great movietruly sad
Oct 22 2021,negative,i believe most reviews in here are just fanboys of the original 1984 dune  i admit it was good for the era  the 2000 frank herberts dune in my opinion was much better  and it was just a mini series with a fraction of the budget  i expected so much more with this big of a cast
Oct 22 2021,positive,unbelievable just when i said here it comes im so sooo ready for the next two hours of and it ended i was awestruck i sat through two hours of essentially the best exposition ever plus a cataclysm it was like watching the first two and a half steps of  an epic exposition inciting incident rising action  then having to stand up and stretch my legs for an intermission its going to be a long and painful intermission because i was already prepared to sit through another two to three hours of this film and now i will have to bide my time it will be worth it if this movie was good and it was good then the next is going to blow our minds stunning visuals and so faithful to the feeling of the book that i even experienced something i never thought i would experience again the initial oh thats kind of silly and farfetched to the im religiously invested in this world and its rules bless the maker and his water no one can ever deny that denis villeneuve is a trueandtrue fan of the novel he was able to recreate even the most intimate nuances that all of us experienced differently when reading the book such an experience see it in theatres even if you dont end up loving or liking the film you wont regret it
Oct 22 2021,positive,mindblowing such an engaging adaption of the book i cant wait for part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,overall a great half of a movie the story ends when jessica and paul head to sietch tabr with stilgar the scenes are appropriately epic the soundtrack was great
Oct 22 2021,positive,see it on the big screen and then see it in imax if you can its worth it
Oct 22 2021,positive,the sheer scale of this film is mindblowing from the beautiful cinematography to the brilliant soundtrack this one is an absolute banger
Oct 22 2021,positive,overall i liked it but it wasnt great i liked that it mostly stuck to the book with only a few variations the thopters were the best effect in the movie believable physics and sound the desert scenes were excellent far too many scenes of fremen not wearing still suit face coverings which is totally contrary to the fremen suit concept but understandable in a movie where punters want to see faces i was gratefulthat we didnt have to listen to brolin singing
Oct 22 2021,positive,great movie  very pleased that they did this book justice
Oct 22 2021,positive,so to expound a little bit  on the new dune movie it is a very faithful reflection of the book and that is why its so good villeneuve has subtly rammed it with dense references to the source material couple bits left out the dinner party for example bombadil style but he can be forgiven for that 25 hours is a long time and whilst there was a pleasing amount of exposition it literally flew by my friend sitting next to me who hadnt read the book felt the same i will say perhaps the emotional connection wasnt quite what id hoped for  the first half of the book is meant to be quite harrowing but it is a great and unique movie that relegates the lynch version to its deserved place in the dustbin of history the same feeling as when i saw a new hope or fellowship of the ring possibly not but that could just be the fact that i am older and more jaded in my opinion however it is the best scifi movie since return of the jedi in 83 but this is different  with star wars the source material was thinner and more childlike here you are adapting what is effectively literature the pinnacle of the genre and the themes are deeper darker and more adult  and thats the reason non scifi fans should also see it i dont particularly like romcoms but i love when harry met sally bladerunner 2049 was a visual treat but lacked the resonance of the and source material of the original game of thrones went slowly downhill when it veered from the books the source material for dune is arguably best in class and the movie does it justice its always good to experience the best in class even if youre unfamiliar with a genre villeneuve deserves a lot of credit for this movie
Oct 22 2021,positive,i was already a fan of the book and id seen the preview back in july so i was already hyped for the film it didnt disappointed in any way at all in fact it surpassed all my expectations i actually burst into tears when the screen went black at the end i felt quite overwhelmed its stunningly beautiful from the landscape the sets the costumes the art direction and of course the cast the story is beautifully laid out for us and even though i knew what was going to happen i was still on the edge of my seat at times the only negative is that we now have to wait for part 2
Oct 22 2021,negative,typical of viewers these daysanything with dazzling effects gets praise very likely that most people reviewing this werent even born when the original dune was released how do you outdo the noveltythe actorsthe soundtrack of musical masterminds of toto                           one answer  you dont
Oct 22 2021,positive,if youre into game of thrones and star wars youre going to love this movie if you find those to be boring and not your style then probably not     this movie has incredible acting direction music heart and action it feels like a big budget indy film in the best way cant believe they didnt shoot it back to back with part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,wow they got it right absolutely amazing yay
Oct 22 2021,positive,this needs a part 2 and six sequels
Oct 22 2021,positive,dune does the 1980s original justice modernizing it with superior cinematography highlighting beautiful landscape shots and scenes where the movie lacks is not expanding more on some of the key characters and important story devices like the spice which is the entire motivation of the characters making the audience care less about them and the world also the last about 45 minutes there are somewhat minor lighting and focusing issues on the screen where you almost have to squint to watch overall great movie retelling a classic sci fi epic 910
Oct 22 2021,positive,the imagining of the atmosphere ornithopters and the worms were very evocative of the book  i really liked the continuity of the story it helped me to fit together some actions in a flow that i had separated in my mind the attack of the sardaukar and dr yuehs treachery
Oct 22 2021,positive,epic captivating wellcast amazing soundtrack  this movie ticked all the boxes for me
Oct 22 2021,positive,this adaptation of dune from book i to half way of book ii is an awesome movie with incredible acting by all its story is such a unique and i would posit a necessary one for the danger of a character like paul atreides
Oct 22 2021,positive,dont be a pirate simp go watch it in a cinema
Oct 22 2021,positive,absolutely profound a masterpiece of cinema every inch of this movie has been carefully crafted to make a film thats true to its source and pushes the entire field of cinema forward 
Oct 22 2021,positive,this is a great movie for year  but action scene have to improve
Oct 22 2021,positive,if youre planning on seeing dune do yourself a favor and see it on the biggest screen you can find over watching at home  one of the most immersive movies i have ever seen it was absolutely fantastic must see for fans of the books however anyone could enjoy
Oct 22 2021,positive,it is a masterpiece one of the best movies of the decade
Oct 22 2021,positive,cant find anything that i dislike  and ive been looking for it
Oct 22 2021,positive,its epic its fair to say that vileneuve knows his craft and this movie needs part ii as soon as possible
Oct 22 2021,positive,loved it as both an adaptation and sci fi flick sound design had me on my knees
Oct 22 2021,positive,absolutely great movie amazing spectacles great acting great story top notch vfc can only get better with a part 2 
Oct 22 2021,positive,denis is so good with his storytelling his shots were amazing his pacing was great for a film that has a long story to tell it needs to be seen in theatres on the big screen
Oct 22 2021,positive,dune part one was a stellar visual masterpiece the visual effects were remarkable some of the best ive ever seen the music was exceptional one of the best scores ive ever heard the cinematography was gorgeous the performances were stupendous especially from timothée chalamet rebecca ferguson stellan skarsgård oscar issac jason momoa charlotte rampling zendaya sharon duncanbrewster javier bardem and josh brolin the costumes were outstanding the makeup was superb especially on stellan skarsgård the writing especially the screenplay was excellent the sets were spectacular this was an a movie and really hope they do a sequel
Oct 22 2021,positive,denis villeneuve delivered as always
Oct 22 2021,positive,fantastic this time they did the frank herbert novel justice on the big screen and i thought the new bond film was good
Oct 22 2021,positive,the most faithful to the book to date cast has good chemistry incredible score
Oct 22 2021,positive,i had high expectations for this film and somehow im stunned to say that it exceeded them villeneuve and collaborators 1 delivered a miraculous translation of herberts byzantine narrative into film and 2 managed to elevate the source material with some very minor but highly effective developments i did not expect this film to be nearly as moving beautiful terrifying and profound as it was it was truly a cultural experience and should absolutely be experienced first in the theater the imax showing i attended was unforgettable
Oct 22 2021,positive,meh at best its like someone tried to combine tremors with the new disney star wars it poorly explained what was going on or why anyone was doing anything and the end was basically just a set up for a sequel if you already have hbomax go for it but its not worth going to the theaters for and you wont watch it twice
Oct 22 2021,positive,despite some negative reviews ive read i must admit i enjoyed the movie its bit drawn out passing the 2hr mark and not enough action those are the only reasons i give this movie 4 stars out of 5 great storyline but couldve been directed a little better overall i would recommend seeing this movie 
Oct 22 2021,positive,this movie is incredible  wow could not recommend more 
Oct 22 2021,positive,beautiful and mesmerizing half of a movie
Oct 22 2021,positive,this was a great adaptation that had me engaged and remembering the amazing book i cant wait to see the next one
Oct 22 2021,positive,a great adaptation of frank herberts original novel  masterclass of cinematography truly an emersive experience 
Oct 22 2021,positive,finally my favorite book is being done justice beautifully shot movie and true to the story and characters definitely my favorite movie of all time now
Oct 22 2021,positive,beautifully made attention to detail in the development of the characters the cinematography was excellent and the sound effects were engulfing
Oct 22 2021,positive,this movie was such a marvel to behold as the fan of the frank herberts novel denis respected the source material i cannot wait for part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,really refreshing take on scifi not your typical blockbuster pacing cant wait for part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,superb adaptation of frank herberts epic book cast is magnificent
Oct 22 2021,positive,wonderfully directed beautiful picture inmersive and creative visually well acted with good castings ended about little over half way through book 1 not as descriptive or in depth as the book and cut alot of politically narrative scenes but necessary to keep the runtime in check good movie overall good choice and best seen in imax     great location to end a date night
Oct 22 2021,positive,true cinema it was an experience in true imax
Oct 22 2021,positive,true to the books wellpaced and thank goodness they didnt try to get too much done in a single movie
Oct 22 2021,positive,very good but short of total greatness  a lot of star power which helped it  but with a sequel that completes the story unfortunately a 3 year wait that will kill this golden goose  so ultimately a fail  too bad as the set design and artistic eye was excellent
Oct 22 2021,negative,all doom and gloom the over the top prometheus sounds design covers up the uneventful pace and gave me a splitting headache star wars without humor it falls into all the scifi stereotypes giant worm ridiculous sword fights in year 100000 i dont think so boring end the main actor shines and aquaman is quite cool jodorosky would have done it much better back in the day but marketing research told wb the kids like it dark
Oct 22 2021,positive,the showing of the visions and the explaining of the pseudo religion does great justice to the books long thought impossible to bring to life on screen great movie will watch again
Oct 22 2021,positive,first 5 minutes are crucial to understand the film for those new to dune but those familiar will likely love it
Oct 22 2021,positive,the scope and size of this film is rightly split into two pieces from the start the marriage of music landscapes and perfect cinematography grips you and doesnt let go the casting is perfectly done with each actor living their characters in a way that harmonizes with their environment every scene was a visual and auditory treat i saw it on my home theater but will be going in imax to relive and enhance my first viewing experience its a must see
Oct 22 2021,positive,from the beginning to the endi was mesmerized by this movie from the castto the musicsets and screenplay i didnt want it to end i cant believe they didnt make the sequel at the same time i dont know if i can wait 2 years to see how it all ends 5 stars
Oct 22 2021,positive,must be seen on the big screen awe inspiring in its scale accessible to fans of the book and newcomers alike and captures the layers and intrigues of the novel elegantly and without patronising the audience  yes it ends on a cliffhanger but this film has its own arc and is a complete film in its own right though it would be a great tragedy if we deprived of the sequel
Oct 22 2021,positive,jaw dropping cinematography orgasmic soundtrack excited for the next few movies
Oct 22 2021,positive,this adaptation of the novel dune meets the hype the story the directing the cast the visual effects  its pretty mythic in scope and incredible to watch looking forward to the sequel already those dragonfly like helicopters and the sand worms were amazing to watch
Oct 22 2021,positive,the film had an epic sense of grandeur that i havent felt in a long time the scale and the sound design were some of my favorite points excellent hoping for a part two
Oct 22 2021,positive,i loved it but im going to be salty as heck if we dont get a part 2 
Oct 22 2021,positive,it was a very well done condensed adaptation of the book and was presented for first time viewers too all the actors were on point and the action scenes were amazing cannot wait for part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,incredible movie cannot wait until part 2 in 2022
Oct 22 2021,positive,what a magnificent mystical trip that wasits aesthetically impressive every shot of the film feels like a paintingit is possible to tell the difference between a movie and a passion work created with love
Oct 22 2021,positive,seeing the book come to life was one of the best cinematic experiences of my life the costumes and sets and the creativity that brought these alien cultures to life has me blown away just astonishing sound design and sore are excellent   now he has 5 hours to tell the story of dune so some things are naturally left out it is dialoguelite focusing on characterizing paul and leto and jessica that means we do miss out on some beloved side characters but i honestly do not think it detracted from the telling it hit every story beat from the book flawlessly and i am so hopeful and excited for part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,vivid experience into the dune universe hans zimmer music is stunning
Oct 22 2021,positive,it was ok but it took the first hour to understand what exactly was going on plus it was over two and a half hours long and this is just the first movie
Oct 22 2021,positive,amazing movie my favorite of the year so far definitely needs to be experienced in imax
Oct 22 2021,positive,sets the bar for the genre  the detail and nuances of the book translated beautifully into the language of film  visually epic
Oct 22 2021,positive,i got in with high hopes for this movie and wasnt disappointed
Oct 22 2021,positive,best movie ive seen in years im a fan of dune already and im so impressed the film is so true to the book without clunky exposition its so cleverly made its beautiful and big and aweinspiring
Oct 22 2021,negative,all symbolism and no story i claudius wannabe dressed up with huge sets 
Oct 22 2021,positive,denis villeneuve continue the streak and do not disappoint once again
Oct 22 2021,positive,my only gripe is that i gotta wait for more parts this was amazing the visuals the set pieces costumes scope and scale the acting the music etc etc was never bored and just stared with my mouth open for 2 and half hours just epic
Oct 22 2021,neutral,i had to give it a 255 half a movie half a score i love the books i even enjoy lynchs movie especially the extended edition free on youtube but this just felt slow to me i actually took breaks from it i wont mention too much in this but the 2021 woke factor was cranked up for this of course however i could care less just give me a well paced movie     as someone who read the books and saw the previous film i know the plots within plots within plots however this movie despite being so long and only being half of the whole movie doesnt clearly lay anything out     whoever did the costuming obviously saw dark city few a few too many times as well     the good sound was amazing visuals are amazing i found 34 of the acting to be great although some people seem miscast     i recommend watching it on hbo max where you can take breaks i really cant see spending 20 to see this in a theater for 2 hours and 35 minutes for it only to be half of the movie
Oct 22 2021,positive,absolutely amazing and a start to a new super franchise an instant classic
Oct 22 2021,positive,gorgeous evoked the books expansive world and stayed exciting
Oct 22 2021,positive,absolutely sensational not a dialogue heavy movie but has insane visuals incredible score and a moving turbulent plotline 
Oct 22 2021,positive,green light the sequel 
Oct 22 2021,positive,denis villeneuves dune is a monumental cinematic achievement     a colossal space opera full of quiet whispers complex political struggles messianic figures  philosophical ideologies     one of the most beautiful  contemplative scifi blockbusters of all time
Oct 22 2021,positive,cant wait for part two
Oct 22 2021,positive,with beautiful acting stunning cinematography and a carefully executed plot this movie succeeds at introducing an entire new world without becoming information heavy or overbearing  dunescifilord of the ringsfantasy
Oct 22 2021,positive,the cinematography music costume design directing techniques and acting on this movie are all insane even though i was confused about the relationships and the story as i never read the book i was able to enjoy this movie as this is a true work of art 
Oct 22 2021,positive,loved it visuals were great the score was amazing ive read and love the book and i was just amazed seeing it really come to life
Oct 22 2021,positive,amazing best movie experience ive had in a long time cant wait for part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,visual masterpiece true to the source i only wish i could watch part 2 now
Oct 22 2021,positive,dune is as majestic as the maker shaihulud    i watched it on the 24th of september  in imax and it was quite the unique experience dune is unlike anything you have ever watched on the big screen an experience that stimulates the senses and leaves you pumped up for whats to come  i even rewatched it in its standard format 2 weeks later     before you keep on reading many of my notes will be negative and may outweigh the positive ones but i am very orthodox in terms of booktofilm adaptions which is something i advice you not to do because it ruined my experience of dune i will try to review it as objectively as i can as a fan of the book the adaptation fell short of capturing the beauty tension and complexity of the book now does that mean it is bad no simply no as its own entity dune 2021 takes the source material and translates it to the big screen by taking half a book with a structure that is a causal chain of events and tries to morph it into a threeact structure narrative that ticks the boxes of necessary scriptwriting elements so independently viewed dune is an excellent cinematic spectacle even though this adaptation was generally faithful to the book and included the most necessary scenes and being a half a book it failed on expanding or at least properly developing many elements in the story and underutilized many characters and this was my beef with this adaption in addition to moments that felt so small when in the book they were much bigger or at least with a larger scope    i will try to disassociate between book and film as much as possible going further    in terms of technicalities denis villeneuve is an excellent director the way he films nonhuman elements cities landscapes makes them feel like they have their own personality breathing with vividness and humanity the director really knows hot to make the human element active in stories that are dehumanizing or rely on other scopes some moments left me with an open jaw for minutes its truly a unique cinematic experience formed by a very original story amazing worldbuilding elements and production design villeneuve could use a lot less cutting and leave a few shots some room to properly breathe because for 2h 35m that are felt you would expect a more developed story and not a somewhat rushed one and really slowing down some shots and scenes would have helped the film a lot more the simplest example is the prologue montage which was extremely rushed but i could rewatch it over and over again because it is really awesome  and kudos to villeneuve for properly explaining the complex world of dune without making the exposition feel out of place    denis villeneuve couldnt have achieved this visual beauty without the director of photography greig fraser in terms of visuals its not as good as villeneuves previous film blade runner 2049 nevertheless dune remains a visual spectacle     dunes heart is timothee chalamets paul atreides the film revolves around him even when the scenes are not about him and this is genius because every single thing in the film serves a purpose in pauls journey in both part one and part two as you will see later on so many small moments were very intimate and precious for our protagonist that will not be fully appreciated until part two is released the story focuses on pauls journey and breaks the balance between politics and the characters that the novel properly maintained which leaves the politics and the events of dune rather underdeveloped with just barely enough information to understand them and not feel confused     dune part one feels like a part one its a movie that will have a sequel this film is like the first two acts of a story with part two being the third nevertheless dune leaves you satisfied and wanting more not disappointed or cheated i could compare it to the fellowship of the ring but with a few more unresolved plot points    the film is perfectly cast which makes me sad to see many characters being underused or not properly developed for example dr yueh was barely developed or explored baron vladimir harkonnen portrayed by the spectacular stellan skarsgaard did not get enough time to shine as the rutheless baron he is in the books i wouldve loved to see more of him and many characters like gurney hallec piter de vries thufir hawat and beast rabban even duke leto played to perfection by oscar isaac could have used more screentime than the time he gets now the existence of a potential part two comforts me as we will get to see some of thes characters in more scenes one of my favorite characters was liet kynes portrayed by sharon duncan brewster jason momoas duncan idaho is fun rebecca ferguson as the lady jessica is just perfection i will say the same to all of the cast members     the visual effects in this film are really welldone something you would expect in bigbudgeted films they successfully realized the world of dune showed scale and brought to life the shaihulud    the ship design is unlike anything seen in other scifi films i loved the ornithopters an idea that seems weird on paper but translated beautifully on screen the entire film has a distinct look that is so alien and futuristic yet grounded in a logical historical progression of humanitys architecture and fashion the costume design and characters looks are excellent and i would really love to see more of them i also have to note that dunes approach to futurism is considerably more realistic and logical than many films attempts at it the production design team nailed it    and last but not least hans zimmer i shouldve talked about the music earlier but oh dear oh dear the music its a perfect musical score please watch dune in imax or dolby atmos hans zimmer is about to grace your ears with glorious music     overall dune was a very good experience that everyone should witness in theaters i cannot wait for part two and hopefully they get to make the rest of the book series
Oct 22 2021,positive,instant classic one the best science fiction films i have ever seen the visuals are amazing and the music is unforgettable exceeded all my expectations i can not wait until part two
Oct 22 2021,positive,one of the most visually stunning movies ever made denis villeneuve remains a visionary with an appealing sense of tone and pacing the cast shines with no letdowns overall this is as great an adaptation of the first half of the first book as one could ask for in film format that being said i cant help but feel that dune may have been even more if it had been a got style premium series there is just as much meat on the bone in terms of political intrigue and a larger universe to explore this film suffers slightly from the volume of worldbuilding on tap from the books but generally succeeds spectacularly i am curious though what those who have never read the books would think are some areas too vague some dialogue too opaque     by way of compliments generally there were few changes from the book but when there were they were well done and thoughtful did not interrupt the flow and complimented things     by way of supernerd complaints their water discipline sucked it was distracting given the heavy importance it is given in the books stillsuits never seem to be treated as the hyper vital lifelines they are in the books where even a few breaths without is considered borderline suicidal or offensively wasteful     overall a very fine film a near unparalleled achievement in terms of cinematography and design certainly
Oct 22 2021,positive,such a beautiful telling of a classic i cant wait for part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,one of the best movie of the year  the visuals score storytelling its way better than i espected
Oct 22 2021,positive,reviewrant incredible potential to be a franchise that defines a generation if you understand that going in then this movie will leave you looking for more with that being said there will be many mixed feelings on dune part 1 heres why 1st half of the movie is immersive in every possible way a movie can be its intoxicating 2nd half hits the breaks gets tunnel vision and start setting up part two lastly and sadly its a 2 12 hr and theres almost 2 generations worth of potential consumers that cannot compute anything over an 1hr 45unless your parents were ogs and snuck you into lots of the rings as a kid acting is an a cinematic and music is an a the storyline inspired lucas to make star wars a rhythm is a b since second half felt like a rolling stop director did well as we expected but this will be the question moving forward it opens as a part 1 but theres no confirmation for a part 2studio is getting a temperature closing thoughts its the story that inspired the greatest franchise in cinematic history movies are about to be a lost art it sucks and we all know it i suggest we all agree that if this franchise gets some breathing room it would be a nice ride into the sunset for us over the next 10 years boomers its up to you im 28 i can sell my soul to netflix with ease but id rather roll the dice for a few more years with you all ps thanks mom childhood movie nights saved me
Oct 22 2021,positive,all i could say about the movies is that is a visually thrilling spectacle with fine performances from the ensemble cast and its just the beginning there is a lot more to come in the upcoming sequels
Oct 22 2021,positive,this movie is on the same caliber of movies as the lord of the rings
Oct 22 2021,positive,mesmerising   i cant imagine a better adaptation of the first half of dune than this  denis villeneuves dune part 1 captures the feel of frank herberts novel perfectly and effectively adapts all the major story beats of the first half of the book
Oct 22 2021,positive,denis villeneuves dune is nothing short of breathtaking gorgeous visuals immaculate production design and perfect sound mixing make dune an experience unlike anything else  the acting is incredible with timothèe chalamet rebecca ferguson oscar isaac jason mamoa stellan skarsgard among a whole lot of others giving their absolute best  denis villeneuves direction elevates the story which is faithful to the original book along the way making changes necessary to modernize the story  my only gripe is that i wanted more    nothing much for me to add here just go and watch dune
Oct 22 2021,positive,best experience ive had in theaters in a long time this is a beautiful experience a spiritual experience a unique and worthy film   go to the imax to feel it   ill see it again soon
Oct 22 2021,positive,great visuals great audio great setup for the rest of the story cant wait for part two
Oct 22 2021,positive,this film is an absolute feast of the senses visually stunning incredible score and a gripping story im a major dune fan and this film delivered on all the right beats capturing the atmosphere and the complex plot of dune beautifully its not perfect no movie is but an absolutely powerful experience that is unique and incredible a must see
Oct 22 2021,positive,the start of something beautiful they laid the foundation of something amazing
Oct 22 2021,positive,it is a masterpiece of craft i loved the movie even though it is just act 1 cant wait to see the sequel in 2023
Oct 22 2021,positive,i loved it it was great timothee did an amazing job the entire cast did really it was paced very well at times it threatened to skip to quickly but it evened out well they did a great job making the inner thoughts visually displayed i cant wait for part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,fantastic bigscreen experience might feel slow to those with low attention spans but it is in the silence that the magic of sound and scene shows itself
Oct 22 2021,positive,this remake so much better than the 80s version
Oct 22 2021,negative,it was alright previews were better than the actual movie vocals quiet music too loud way too long
Oct 22 2021,negative,the worst i hated this movie read the book or watch lynchs version this film has no worth
Oct 22 2021,positive,one of the most beautifully shot orchestrated and cast films ive seen in years villeneuve has delivered an adaptation worthy of praise eagerly anticipating part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,from a moderate scifi fan whos actually read the book  denis villeneuve took great care to honor one of the pillars of worldbuilding sciif a huge complex and nuanced story requires one of the best story tellers alive and villeneuve came through in a big way for an pic novel like dune which has largely been considered unfit for film due to the complexity of the story and the absolutely terrible 1984 lynch version where so much of the beauty and nuance of the story was completely destroyed i was exceedingly nervous about the possibility of a remake let me be clear this is not a remake this is the real deal frank herbert would be proud of what this incredible cast and crew have put forth dont believe these movie critic yahoos who never took the time to read one of the greatest and most influential scifi novels of all time this movie is truly incredible from beginning to end and yes it is only part of the story  a little over half of the first dune novel to be exact but just as weve seen with the lord of the rings wellwritten stories take time to tell especially if youre going to do it right so go see dune several times in theaters so that warner brothers approved dune part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,what a breath of fresh air  excellent story telling acting and cinematics  this is the way dune should have been made from the start
Oct 22 2021,positive,where do i begin the visuals are stunning maybe the best ive ever seen the music is haunting and yet beautiful hans zimmer delivers yet another masterpiece the performances are heart felt and timothee chalamet gives perhaps the best chosen one performance since mark hamill by the end youll believe in him too the action is jaw dropping inventive and yet very real feeling this movie does exactly what its supposed to do it engulfs you in this very deep world and the lore and makes you ask is there really more and yet this is answered with the line    this is only the beginning    only the beginning we may be in store for the best space epic series ever made and im so ready for part ii
Oct 22 2021,positive,best looking movie since blade runner 2049 some of the scenes are not just shot beautifully but the masterwork in acting accompanying those shots sets up scenes that steal your breath away     pacing was also on point they they reworked arc  little to sandwich some of the longer drawn out parts between parts of heavy action the acting just feels so genuine that you cant help but get sucked into the story     absolute must see
Oct 22 2021,positive,left hanging for the next installment which may never happened
Oct 22 2021,positive,movie flowed very well with great acting and special effects very well made and enjoyable
Oct 22 2021,positive,so glad it closely stuck to the book
Oct 22 2021,positive,very good adaptation of the book finally a movie worthy of the title
Oct 22 2021,positive,breathtaking world with a powerful set of characters in a science fiction starved time we live in might see it twice
Oct 22 2021,positive,dune is a beautiful piece of cinema lets get that out of the way i truly enjoyed taking in its splendor the worlds felt rich and alive real even everything was large as life i dont have a baseline to work with im not familiar with the source material so i cant compare it with the 1984 film or the 2000 miniseries my issue with the movie is that it felt incomplete i know there is definitely a sequel in the works but the point we left off in the movie was rather anticlimactic the film doesnt stand alone and at twoandahalf hours i kind of expected it to other than that dune is a spectacle that i recommend even if it means committing to a part two
Oct 22 2021,positive,astounding visuals perfect costume and set design topnotch soundtrack and a stunning story that keeps you at the edge of your seat wondering what comes next those who read the book dont spoil this one for the others
Oct 22 2021,positive,i liked the movie it paste score cinemtorgaphy very much whaiting for part two
Oct 22 2021,positive,4 out of 5 stars dune is a beautifully done epic science fiction film that is the start of a new sci fi franchise or an attempt to revive one even with the opening title saying dune part one i never read the novels only knowing the film is the first half of the first dune novel leaving the film with half a story and no climax which is frustrating and exciting to see more films one can hope this film is a success for more which it does deserve more films the plot is good and does open up for an epic story paul timothee chalamet is from the house of atreides which he accompanies his parents to arrakis which is a homeworld that has spice produced in the desert spice can be used for intergalactic travel house of atreides is looking for a reasonable peaceful trade while house of harkonnen lead by baron stellan skarsgard is sending his army to arrakis for an all out war the cast ensemble is huge and every one did great playing there characters timothee chalamet taking the main role was phenomenal rebecca ferguson was also good along with oscar isaac josh brolin and jason momoa was good zendaya is fantastic even if her role was short but saved for a sequel script did a great job with the world building and details on setting up the story great with the character building even for being a complex book director denis villeneuve did a great job in making this film a cinematic masterpiece you can expect great cinematography set up in capturing beautiful landscapes visual effects and having hans zimmers music score blasted at a high volume every sequence is designed for a cinematic scope to be seen on the big screen at the theatre with a great sound quality also a down side on what you can expect from denis villeneuve is the slow pacing the film does have some action sequences with great visual effects the giant sandworm sequence is cool do not expect any big battle sequences there is a brief battle scene in a dream sequence that is hinting towards the next film positives the film is a good start for a franchise the scope with action visual effects cast ensemble production sets music score and direction all aims high for a cinematic experience that is epic and loud it is one spectacular experience the action sequences were good also ending abruptly for more films do not expect a big climatic battle negatives director denis villeneuve is fantastic in making a cinematic visual feast he does take his time with his storytelling even with a slow pacing which he suffers in all his films overall dune is a good science fiction film which is spectacular and epic i am excited and hoping to see more films it delivered with a great world building for the story visual effects and action it deserves to be seen on the big screen theatres
Oct 22 2021,positive,great movie cant wait for the next one
Oct 22 2021,positive,of all movie adaptations of scifi classics this is among the most faithful  as some critics have said the source material is complex and unwieldy but villeneuve proves equal to the task of bringing herberts universe to life  not your everyday space opera and you wont leave humming the soundtrack but impressive worldbuilding vision and execution  those who havent read the books my feel shortchanged by the character development and relationships between and motivations of the characters but theres only so much anyone could do given the scope of material to be covered much covered by exposition and voiceover in lynchs version is left out here however on balance i think thats a good thing  i was skeptical of the casting of chalamet but he capably inhabits the character of paul and by the end i find him believable  heres hoping its successful enough to complete the saga on screen
Oct 22 2021,positive,i was very excited to see this movie i highly enjoyed it but it was a little slow at times the soundtrack almost overtaking some of the wide shots of the movie while being very loud also the dreams taking a little to long i say please go watch it and enjoy a movie that really breaks the mold of we have to have fast paced action while pushing the story line to fit it into a movie this movie takes its time and it is refreshing to see film today do that im excited for part two
Oct 22 2021,positive,brilliant adaptation with superb cinematography and an awe inspiring score it left me breathless and begging for more
Oct 22 2021,positive,dune is a visual masterpiece the set designs and worldbuilding is amazing its a film that should definitely be seen theaters however its not a perfect film it has some pacing issues making it a bit slow at times but the build up for whats to come if part 2 gets made that is will be worth it
Oct 22 2021,positive,if they played movie at normal speed instead of half a movie in slomo they could have wrapped it up in under one hour without losing an ounce of the story
Oct 22 2021,positive,a dramatic take on the classic sf novel most of the stellar cast get only a few scenes to share in the 150 mins of total screen time but they all nail their parts  charlotte rampling dave bautista david dalmachian and stellan skarsgard     but this is pauls story and timothee chalamet becomes paul atreides and by the end of the film he is prepared to become paul muaddib as well     take it from chani this is only the beginning
Oct 22 2021,positive,this is probably one of the best adaptations of a book that i have ever seen the critics that say that it is boring or too slow have never read the books the books are quiet lengthy and slow paced but masterfully written analogues to modern politics i for one am glad that the movie stayed so true to the original work i went into this with low expectations thinking that there is no way to make a book like dune into a movie even the mini series struggled to maintain pace and depth denis villeneuve has succeeded in creating one of the best movies of 2021 and what i can truly say is the best cinematic recreation of this legendary piece of science fiction heres to hoping that part 2 is made and is as true to the source i am genuinely excited for the next chapter in this series and hope that they make this into a saga one that could easily replace star wars especially after their last 6 films
Oct 22 2021,positive,book fans will love it average movies goers are gonna be confused i feel good about it
Oct 22 2021,positive,paid to see it in imax even though i have hbo max so glad i did knew it was half a movie going in and was blown away scope sound and story watched it again on hbo when i got home with subtitles to pick up what i missed which turned out to be very little compare that to dune 1984 which you had to watch 16 times to get your head around i did come to be a big fan in the end warts and all
Oct 22 2021,positive,i honestly didnt want to see the movie as its not a genre i particularly like my partner convinced me to go it was mind blowing
Oct 22 2021,negative,i was so excited for dune having enjoyed the books but man this was a boring adaptation to say the least tbe war was rushed and the music was way out of proportion compared to what was happening on screen  super let down if they make a sequel i hope someone else directs it just wow so bad
Oct 22 2021,negative,who needs ambien when youve got dune i love sci fi but the diluded plot the acid trip slowness and snails pace just wreck this cinematography and costumes are amazing its like youre dropped into someones life and none of it makes sense i seriously thought the movie had been on for 3 hours and it had only been 1 hour i kept falling asleep my husband and i left after 2 hours dont waste your timego see the last duel now that was amazing
Oct 22 2021,positive,fantastic finally a movie that is true to the original writing 
Oct 22 2021,positive,this really needed some key scenes in the book to give a better context to events which eventually unfold also a scene had sound fx too loud which drowned out some dialog other than that i absolutely loved this film and it does the book so much justice wow i just hope some scenes are added back in on a directors cut bluray
Oct 22 2021,positive,it drags a little broke up the story into parts and some what true to the book was tweeked a bit it definitely wont be a repeat watch unlike the 1984 version
Oct 22 2021,positive,slow and methodically built for part ii to be epic 
Oct 22 2021,negative,the cinematography saves the movie other than that pacing was to slow wont be upset if a second movie is never released
Oct 22 2021,positive,loved it it is so much more epic than i remember the last one being
Oct 22 2021,positive,immersive a whole new world
Oct 22 2021,positive,that was fantastic
Oct 22 2021,positive,its really a huge feat of a movie everything about the scope visual and sound is off the charts especially on a big screen or imax its true to the spirit of the book and you can tell it was written by a fan for the fans
Oct 22 2021,positive,that was a good movie cant wait for the next part 
Oct 22 2021,positive,you can nit pick all you wantbut its the best remake and adaption to a classic anyone has every seen anyone involved with the making of this movie should be proud just when i was losing faith in hollywood the spice must flow
Oct 22 2021,positive,ok i really liked it and cant wait for part two as there is a lot of story left acting was great and the visuals and effects were too notch
Oct 22 2021,positive,overall it was a great moviegoing experience however i did find myself lost in the plot quite often it seems like this movie was custombuilt for the fans so if you havent read the books i havent you might get a little lost
Oct 22 2021,negative,very very slow but great cinematically
Oct 22 2021,negative,this movie was boring
Oct 22 2021,negative,movie too long with no sensebackground music too loud
Oct 22 2021,positive,im not big on the scifi genre as a whole but i genuinely enjoyed this movie a bit slow towards the end but the first 23rds of the movie had me hooked visual beautiful great acting and overall very immersive
Oct 22 2021,positive,beautiful telling have a story bigger than the screen i hope you watched it in imax
Oct 22 2021,positive,oh my absolutely incredible
Oct 22 2021,positive,dune is a huge blockbuster movie spectacle with powerful performances a captivating story and beautiful cinematography
Oct 22 2021,positive,its great and gets the core of the book
Oct 22 2021,negative,amazing how they managed mess it up so badly and make this sooo boring
Oct 22 2021,positive,being a fan of the original dune i was super excited to watch the new upgraded dune but im feeling hurt there were so many scenes that it felt short the deliverance was off i didnt feel the magic of the storytelling where it captures you and gives you goosebumps when you cry if there is an epic moment i felt nothing i was hoping to feel something i wish and pray for part two that if they produce it please please give it the harry potter magic and the excitement of mad max
Oct 22 2021,positive,this is the version weve been waiting for  i hope audiences turn out to support this movie and we get not just dune part 2 but the same movie treatments for several more books in the series as well
Oct 22 2021,positive,the greatest scifi film ive seen in years
Oct 22 2021,positive,visually awe inspiring the costumes in particular were fantastic
Oct 22 2021,positive,the worst part about this movie is waiting for warner brothers to approve the sequel

Oct 22 2021,positive,alot going on and alot gets lost because of that    awesome in 4d and it wouldve been way to drawn out and boring if in regular 2d the sleeper would not awaken if in a regular theater    beautiful effects but the actual cinematography and shots werent great    the costumes and acting i feel were better in the original dune movie i hope the 2nd part is better
Oct 22 2021,positive,frank herbert would be a happy man i know i am lets go part 2

Oct 22 2021,positive,an absolutely excellent film definitely see it on imax if you can it needs to be seen on a big screen
Oct 22 2021,positive,loved every second of this movie amazing soundtrack and cinematography with an amazing cast i was engaged in every moment and never felt as though anything dragged the pacing was outstanding watched on hbomax but will definitely be going to see it in imax asap 
Oct 22 2021,positive,great visuals also and very important this movie was very true to the book not some weird interpretation  acting was very good and the costumes were great
Oct 22 2021,positive,just different enough from the other iterations to keep me interested good production quality minus a couple cgi scenes great casting and great adaptation
Oct 22 2021,positive,just a couple points that werent how i envisioned them from the book but overall it was awesome
Oct 22 2021,positive,denis has done it again blade runner 2049 was my favorite film and now dune part one is a masterpiece      i will see it over and over again
Oct 22 2021,positive,this villenueve flick feels like kotor with royal houses and done so well i simply wish denis would pick up a trilogy of star wars films star wars aside this is one of the best films ive seen in a long time i cannot remember the last time i jumped and silently cheered during a screening this gave me all of the scifi bad assery i came for and more excellent cast excellent visuals and most of all a damn good sound team i see you fellow sound lads
Oct 22 2021,positive,if you enjoy sci fi movies this is the movie for you this movie is shot amazingly and storing telling is phenomenal must see
Oct 22 2021,positive,incredible movie the visuals the sound the soundtrack simply stunning film   rebecca ferguson owns the movie as lady jessica

Oct 22 2021,positive,gorgeous cinematography with a solid attachment to the source material  definitely a must see for both fans of the novels and those who like science fiction
Oct 22 2021,positive,they covered about the first have of the book in this movie excited for the second one
Oct 22 2021,positive,one of the best science fiction films of all time
Oct 22 2021,negative,bought imax tickets but the excitement  anticipation got the best of me so decided to hbo max it thursday night andwas i totally let down was definitely not impressed idk if i saw another movie than the rest of the reviewers but this is not as awe out of this world spectacular visual tantalizing mind blowing jaw dropping insane masterpiece as people were and are saying it wasis  actually slightly dull and plain glad i didnt imax it
Oct 22 2021,positive,few tiny things i think it missed from the books and strangely a few ways i prefer lynchs version paul came across as more empathetic jessica was a stronger character but overall this was a stunningly beautiful movie incredible score  superb cast sublime direction must see now please make at least one sequel if not more we need part two of the book at the very least
Oct 22 2021,positive,coming in not knowing anything about dune it left me wanting a part two and kept my attention the entire time that i only realized i sat thru a two hour movie wanting more so many great shots coupled with actors that take you where the story wants you to go book is next to read and patiently wait for part two sheesh
Oct 22 2021,negative,terrible audience involvement and stimulation
Oct 22 2021,positive,worthy of the books thats saying something
Oct 22 2021,positive,everything i hoped it would be and more villeneuve was born to make scifi on this scale
Oct 22 2021,positive,fascinating deep thought provoking cant wait for more intentional screenwriting beautiful cinematography truly impressed with the acting what a build 
Oct 22 2021,positive,my husband and i really enjoyed this film the visuals are stunning the acting is welldone it kept our attention throughout i kept wondering when it would end as this is just part one cant wait to see part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,most of the movie is reserved for storytelling and i think that they did this in a way that is engaging which i was pleasantly surprised to see because storytelling the whole time can get boring so many amazing actors that lured me into watching and they did not disappoint the cinematography is really unique i felt like i was watching history unfold with the birth of a new hit series overall awesome 55
Oct 22 2021,positive,a scifi odyssey on scale with star wars and lord of the rings     i am so pleasantly surprised at the magnificent feat denis villenueve pulled off dune was long thought to be impossible to get right on the big screen this was completely smashed by the incredible cast score cinematography and vision of this crew
Oct 22 2021,positive,a true sciif epic the book is one of my alltime favorites and i thought the movie was a very faithful adaptation any changes were minor and in most cases made the storyline more clear and easier to follow
Oct 22 2021,positive,i loved it having grown up seeing the made for tv version so many years ago to see it in the theatre and with such emphasis in character development im excited to see how it all comes together i recommend you wont be disappointed rereading the book beginning tonight
Oct 22 2021,positive,an absolutely stunning adaptation of frank herberts dune  the script was superb pace matched the novel costume designs soundtrack everything  this movie deserves an oscar    bring on dune part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,as a fan of the books i was really hoping they did this movie justice i was nervous because i had seen the original 1980s version which was terrible  this story was not meant to be told in two hours scifi channel released another version with james macvoy which was done really well in my opinion probably one of the best adaptations ive ever seen from a book it kept things that were important and excluded all the noise in between  this version of dune accomplished the same it is such a beautiful film from the cinematography set design and the wardrobe is so elegant the casting was stellar diverse beautiful and graceful im happy to see that the intention is to make more movies and i hope they do because the story is so its so far from over  if the makers in the next films follow the same formula the rest are going to be amazing the story gets better and better
Oct 22 2021,positive,really good visuals stayed true to the book a must watch
Oct 22 2021,positive,saw dune last week in japan   excellent realization of the book on the big screen something no one thought possible  visually it is spectacular with the world making technology costumes etc creating a vivid representation of the worlds of dune  i was hooked on this film in its first minutes      overall this was a fan service movie made by and for dune fans which may well limit its appeal   viewers who have never read the book or those who did not like it may find it a ponderous boring exercise lacking transformerslike  action or averngerslike character development and action but what is one the screen reflects the book extremely well   remember 2001 a space odyssey is a ponderous boring film often cited today as a classic    on the downside i found the music too much at times but not nearly as overwhelming as the last bladerunner film which are two peas from the same pod musically      the bigger the screen the better
Oct 22 2021,positive,had me drawn in from the opening scene dreams are messangers from the deep kept me drawn to what comes next and dreading the ending because i knew i would have to wait for more fantastic visuals and sound on top of great acting terrific job   this franchise has places to go and it would be nice if they started on the next chapter soon
Oct 22 2021,positive,just watched this new adaptation of dune and it exceeded my most optimistic expectations it was fantastic and i cant wait for part 2 loved it
Oct 22 2021,positive,the visuals are sweepingly grande
Oct 22 2021,negative,beautiful cinematography but the whole thing just seemed to come together to form an atmosphere of foreboding rather than a narrative that moved a plot or character development in any meaningful way
Oct 22 2021,positive,not disappointed at all true to book great cast great film if you are a fan
Oct 22 2021,positive,it was true to the book its hard to capture such a story but the movie did a good job of distilling it down without dumbing it down i only hope that they do part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,very well done all the actors are believable in their roles
Oct 22 2021,positive,loved it cant wait for part two
Oct 22 2021,positive,loved it a little slow in parts a time or two when recurring audio climax started to feel overdone as a fan whos read everything published in the duniverse and having read the original series many times i found the movie very satisfying
Oct 22 2021,positive,kind of overrated the effects are the best of the movie the story is interesting but at some point it gets too slow and repetitive not a big deal not sure if i want to see the second part in a few words i think that will be trilogy and the concept is a mix of star wars and game of thrones  sounds more awesome than it is
Oct 22 2021,positive,if every movie was this amazing  
Oct 22 2021,positive,this movie was awesome well done cant wait to see the next one
Oct 22 2021,positive,visually stunning a very good adaptation of the epic science fiction novels first half
Oct 22 2021,positive,incredible in imax would have felt upset if i saw it any other way
Oct 22 2021,negative,incredibly slow and boring 2 out of 10
Oct 22 2021,positive,i think i have been waiting for this film for much longer than i knew it it really set up something that i believe will be the next star wars type of hype and following the characters are refreshing the story line is amazingly complex and yet subtle and easy to follow if you just accept what you see  allow the visuals to drive your feelings and just know that at its heart this is not an agenda pushing film at all  purely driven by a book written years ago  but still rings true in all the passions that we as humans can relate to     if i had to pin some stories that resonate and are similar to it i would mention game of thrones battlestar galactica the hunger games star wars the witcher mad max and oddly enough terminator 2     anyway  hands down it was worth every penny in the theatre and i cant wait for more     i also love the idea that rings true in all of these types of stories  that a true leader never wants to lead they run from it until there is no choice but to be what you never wanted to be and then own it but without hubris
Oct 22 2021,positive,the first time in my life i can say i enjoyed the movie as much as the book  this was a masterpiece
Oct 22 2021,positive,great really liked it
Oct 22 2021,positive,this movie is paced so perfectly and alines with the book so beautifully it is an absolute must see
Oct 22 2021,positive,i watched the film it was better than dune 84 in my opinion what an amazing film and the book references along with themes we see in our world as well no spoilers in my review but i will say this dune 84 was a two part film technically on vhs it was two seperate tapes i can see why villenueve wrote part 1 with part 2 in the works he did it like a tribute to lynchs dune 84 when you watch it you see a some what similar connection but wow i want to watch this again and again villenueve hit a home run with this movie the drop off ending an issue really its not a drop off lets say that     most scifi films even alien or whatever are tough to watch and you get bored easily most dont really explain too well how things happened precisely this film does not lack emotion despite what people have said it is building it up the movie is paul atreides it seems to have a life of its own it is truly dune 1010
Oct 22 2021,positive,great movie need part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,a master class in filmmaking  from an incredible score to beautiful cinematography with spectacular performances and the creation of an entire universe  ive seen it twice and will see it again it demands to be seen on the biggest screen available
Oct 22 2021,positive,best depiction of dune yet handles the complexity and nuances of frank herberts thoroughly  gracefully my only complaint stems from throwaway dialoguemonologues that suffer from poor sound quality why have the moment if the words cant be understood otherwise topnotch
Oct 22 2021,positive,as a 25 year fan of the books ive waited for this day for a very long time my bar was set pretty high and this movie blew all my expectations completely out of the water what an absolutely beautiful translation to the big screen i got out of the theater an hour ago and im still high on spice cant say enough good things about it see it in the theater if you can
Oct 22 2021,positive,fantastic movie they did such a good job of bringing dune to the live screen
Oct 22 2021,positive,epic in scope just like the books good choice of actors cinematography and sound oscars for sure
Oct 22 2021,positive,perfect actors bold liminal sets tense and heartfelt scenes it takes its time to perfectly open up this new world and this new story for us the only problem is we will have to wait so long for the sequel
Oct 22 2021,positive,its a slow burn that reminds me of some of ridley scotts best works like blade runner  same sort of heft and depth  it ends abruptly but this story deserves the scope that a trilogy can deliver  paul has been played by other actors before but this particular performance drives home pauls transformation from young man and son of a great leader to grown man stepping up and moving forward despite great tragedy  the cast is well selected and believable  the sets are grandiose  costumes sufficiently scifi without looking cartoonish like some of the previous versions of the film dont get me wrong i love the late 70s version for what it is  this is particularly the case with the harkonen characters  who project much more menace than in previous adaptations  i hope this one does well at the box office i want to see the rest of the vision for one of my favorite science fiction stories
Oct 22 2021,neutral,dune might be one of the most gorgeous movies that i didnt like visually fantastic great ost epic and amazingly boring a very long prologue but not that kind of prologue that will make you count the days remaining for part 2 but the kind that convinced me not to pay to see the rest of the story on a big screen but beside that you know breathtaking stuff
Oct 22 2021,positive,the music the acting the visuals
Oct 22 2021,positive,first things first this is a film for the big screen even though its already streaming do yourself that favor the scenes flying ornithopters on arrakis among others are just so beautifully shot by denis villeneuve the story covers in about the same runtime only half of the david lynchversion from 1984 and clearly closes as a first part the vibes of the film are quite different from the former in exchanging art deco for bunker feeling as in the older version lots of people die and not just redshirts so dont get attached to certain beloved charactersactors talking about acting the stellar cast lives up to its promise just a hint for the ladies though if you want to keep your aquamangotimage of jason momoa you might want to skip this film he looks very different cleanshaven and a hint for guys zendaya has very little screen time unfortunately    2nd helping watching this great film once more i paid extra attention to the intense score written by hans zimmer this is not your regular soundtrack at times it feels rather like a staccato to only highlight certain scenes with long times of musical silence in between i also noticed that i kind of missed the inner thoughts of certain characters which were audible in the 1984 version more than the first time although that is one of the main flaws of the old version in many peoples opinion oh well you shouldnt compare too much right it is a beautiful movie and i am anxiously waiting for part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,cant wait for part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,slowpaced but stunningly beautiful the film allows you to become immersed in the world of dune action and intrigue on a grand imposing scale yet with careful attention to detail
Oct 22 2021,positive,absolutely gorgeous movie exited for this new saga kinda mad that there was a huge cliff hanger but very excited
Oct 22 2021,positive,finally a return to the epic style of scifi film making  while there are still some logical conundrums occasioned by the source material the movie draws from this iteration does a far better job of smoothing the transition to this new universe  a great opening gambit for a hopeful trilogy which tells a complete story in and of itself while still leaving the audience wanting the sequel
Oct 22 2021,positive,a master class in universe building and a showcase of superb acting talent the soundtrack is subtle but effective the unhurried first half will educate newbies and excite fans the spicier second half will thrill them all
Oct 22 2021,positive,seemed like more of a prequel and wasnt quite as satisfying as i had hoped but itll be an fantastic franchise
Oct 22 2021,positive,a fantastic adaptation of the legendary novel small changes that are welcome includes a stellar cast
Oct 22 2021,positive,this is such a refreshing cinematic version of the story they give the time needed for characters to develop and it lacks the overly dramatic cheesiness of earlier versions naturally the scope of the cinematography is sweeping and the score epic but the imagination in every shot coupled with a very well cast film make this a worthy vision that brings to life dune in a way that probably has not been achievable until now my only dissatisfaction is the wait for the next part where they stopped part one was predictable and they let you know it with the only bit of cheesy dialogue i heard through the entire film someone thought themselves clever with that line but i will take it as an ode to the ones that have come before letting you know there is more awesomeness to come
Oct 22 2021,positive,this is a groundbreaking saga in the making one scifi fans were hungrily waiting for the world building here is masterful and if you like villeneuves style youll probably like this its also quite clear he tried to please a bigger audience and went for a more direct style than say blade runner 2049 i myself prefer his dont tell show storytelling of previous movies more but i can see why he seeked more balance regarding this blade runner was a box office failure after all if this is what it takes to reach a bigger audience and make a sequel possible im perfectly ok with it because it still manages to make you get youself fully immersed     watch it in imax if possible its a treat to the senses and it makes a huge part of the experience especially because its a slow burning movie i can understand why the director didnt want it to premiere in streaming platforms along with the theaters    i find book fans will be pleased since the adaptations made are understandable and doesnt hurt whats crucial to the story but the amazing thing here is that villeneuve made a dune movie that appeals to people who havent read it and that in itself is an enormous achievement since book fans know its a rather dry and detached read to make it pleasing even in the slightest is great filmmaking    if you dont like slowburning movies im afraid this isnt for you its not really a matter of good taste but simply a preference and i fully understand it but if you want to see an entire universe being brought alive vividly right in front of your eyes in its own time than i think you should hop in and enjoy the ride    the only complaint i have with this movie is with the coreography of the fight scenes they are underwhelming since they do not cover a big part of this masterpiece i honestly didnt mind
Oct 22 2021,negative,this is a collection of scenes rather than a movie there is no messageboaring
Oct 22 2021,positive,this may be the best scifi movie since the original star wars trilogy cast was great effects and visual were great the script hit hard and i was dialed into the movie for all 2 and a half hours
Oct 22 2021,positive,a spectacle of a film best experienced in imax or dolby cinema to see in less would be a disservice to yourself for those upset about the ending you would probably be more thankful for it being a twoparter if you were familiar with how crammed other iterations are
Oct 22 2021,positive,it feels halffinished and not as realized as it probably could if a sequel is made it could help it stand but as of now its more world building and foreshadowing than storytelling 
Oct 22 2021,positive,incredible fixed all the issues i had with the source material and was a fresh artistic take that left me breathless i cant wait for the next part
Oct 22 2021,positive,2nd watch even better big source material matched with a big imax experience those involved with this effort delivered well already waiting for part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,i didnt know it was just part 1
Oct 22 2021,positive,great adaptation very unique and cool aesthetic awesome acting
Oct 22 2021,positive,even though it leaves out some early plots from the book it sets up the path that paul is going to be set on in part 2 and maybe even messiah gotta see this in imax if you can there were multiple times i jumped when certain scenes were happening overall great time at the movies
Oct 22 2021,positive,i was a book reader and loved it there were definitely somethings that were different but i understand why they had to and it was still sooo good cant wait for part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,i read dune on the school bus when i was a precocious middle school student in 1983  to say i wasunderwhelmedby the 1984 film is an understatement  so when i started to get wind of this adaptation and its cast i was simultaneously ecstatic and worried that it wouldnt live up to the hype  i shouldnt have worried though  in the capable hands of denis villeneuve this adaptation of dune brings this world to life in a way that perfectly captures my internal vision of this world that ive carried with me for nearly 40 years  its gorgeous to watch and the characters and culture make sense  i cannot wait for part two  fearisthemindkiller
Oct 22 2021,positive,some details about doctor yueh and his motives including how difficult it was for him to be a spy when jessica could tell the he was acting strange
Oct 22 2021,positive,all of it was awesome great story
Oct 22 2021,positive,tok many slow motion of actors acting not a lot decor to soak in the world of dune the book is rich in detail emotions and colors the movie scenes missed out on all that
Oct 22 2021,positive,the movie that everyone has been waiting to see and find outdoes it live up to the hype a simple answer would be a little but not a lot dune is a fascinating spectacle with amazing cinematography its visually amazing brings you back to the time that avatar took control of cinema with its visuals back in 2009 but to stay on track dune is a movie filled with great characters stunning visuals an amazing story that is just left unfinished speaking of our characters this movie is led by timothée chalamet who does well leading this movie our other cast members in this film do an amazing job with what is given to them but many times you are left with saying is that it for this character really or well i guess ill see them in a sequel a feeling of wanting more from this film is a heavy thought that i am left with after watching the story is so dense and sometimes can be convoluted with information hitting you left and right if not knowing everyones name or the slightest detail of facts that have been shared dealing with the conflicts of house atreides and house harkonnen and many others this movie is a slow burn with a spice of action being sprinkled in between but that part doesnt disappoint at all as it is shot beautifully by director denis villeneuve dune is an intriguing movie that leaves you just wanting more a lot more it just feels unfinished leaving you salivating for a sequel that may or may not happen it just feels incomplete but here i am thinking of what to praise it for other than its amazing visuals its hard to give praise to this movie even though it clearly deserves it given the fact who directed but that feels impossible when dune a dense movie leaves so many questions unanswered and leaves you with a come back for more in the sequel ending to leave off on dune might be a movie for you but not for all i think it just might do its due diligence to its fans of the book but that just might be it for me dune is a fun movie that maybe down the line after its sequels hopefully i can comeback to this movie and say i absolutely love it but for now dune is just a fun time for this movie junkie dune gets a 355 stars  mylesed33
Oct 22 2021,positive,visually stunning   its set at a pace that is so different from most big budget scifi movies but it doesnt feel slow or long   very well done   it would be a crime is they dont make part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,such an exciting and interesting world incredible visuals
Oct 22 2021,positive,loved it perfect adaptation of the first half of the book
Oct 22 2021,positive,amazing movie cinematography was out of this world timothée was phenomenal 
Oct 22 2021,positive,speechless  breathtaking
Oct 22 2021,positive,i thought it was fantastic being a fan of the original this did it justice and then some just wish part 2 was already filmed  id like to add for all professionalcritics and their reviews they are an unnecessary and antiquated job now days they rate on political correctness over good content and entertainment sites like this are better off to leave them and their nonsense to the new yorker and other garbage
Oct 22 2021,positive,the movie was just amazing anyone who has read the book will probably love it however it is a complex story that takes awhile to get going if you enjoy simple movie premises then this movie is probably not for you i seriously hope the studio greenlights part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,its fantastic movie they did a great job adapting the book into a movie just dont go in thinking this is going to be a heavy action movie it is more of a political drama
Oct 22 2021,negative,this will go down in history as the worst movie remake of all time
Oct 22 2021,positive,freaking amazing didnt realize it was a trilogy but they did a great job filling the time with excitement the story line was amazing it actually provides more insight into the story vs the original
Oct 22 2021,positive,a great adaptation of the first half of the epic book dune  its immersive visually stunning with great performances directing sound design effects and makeup  chalamet and ferguson are tops  dune is a triumph
Oct 22 2021,positive,holy st i have never seen an adaptation this faithful to the source material
Oct 22 2021,positive,i am not an expert but what i saw at the screen with this movie was so immersive and well done that i was transported inside there just amazing 100100
Oct 22 2021,positive,i want to watch dune part ii tomorrow please
Oct 22 2021,positive,dune was so good man the cast was spot on hans zimmer is the goat denis really got deep with the details simply loved it probably gonna be remembered as one of the greats
Oct 22 2021,positive,2nd time im seeing it its better the 2nd time im understanding the movie alot better now that i missed the first timejust beautifully made film wow
Oct 22 2021,positive,thank you for making this can not wait for part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,it looks promising its kinda slow but its new
Oct 22 2021,positive,not a dune geek  but this was perfect cinema all around excellent first part of an epic i am looking forward to the next installments as well as dusting off that old dusty book to read again bravo
Oct 22 2021,positive,if youve read the book you will probably really enjoy this as i did  i thought it was fantastic and it ends pretty much where you think it would incomplete  i really hope it does well enough to film the 2nd part of the story    im a little nervous because if you havent read the book then you might get bored especially if you dont like villeneuves style
Oct 22 2021,negative,so slow poor character development on the rare occasion something exciting does happen its not interesting because you dont care about the characters it felt like i had sand in my b hole the entire time watching this
Oct 22 2021,positive,epic scifi done to near perfection should be seen in theaters to get the full experience because this film is beautiful
Oct 22 2021,positive,biased opinion it took me 40 years and 3 tries to finish the book which i still hated  the movie is better in that it shows rather than tells epic in scale amazing to behold the movie is still able to simplify and explain key plot points better than herbert did takes its time but never moves tooooo slowly until the somewhat lifeless ending which is only the beginning wisely covers only about the first half of the first book which allows for much greater clarity but  may frustrate audiences expecting resolution even as a disgruntled reader though i felt several characters were poorly developed and underused hopefully theyll be better explored in the sequel still better than herbert better than lynch ill watch part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,amazing movie this one should be experienced in a movie theater with a crystal clear screen and a good sound system one would have fun seeing it on tv but one would have more fun in a really large screen immersing oneself in the spectacle    chalamet is amazing i see him in photos and i dont get the feeling that he is someone who will make me go see his movies not like a denzel washington or an al pacino or even a stellan skarsgard would however he is doing amazing things with his facial expressions saying things just by moving these muscles the gom jabbar scene is a good example of this same thing applies with zendaya i see her in photos and i am meh nevertheless she is a goddess in this movie    oscar isaacs scene without clothes is definitely a tribute to something else some painting some other movie i dont know it is an aesthetically pleasant scene nevertheless skarsgards first appearance is also a tribute to marlon brando you will understand what when you see it the movie is full of memorable emblematic icons were i to see some of the clothesuniforms on the cover of a scifi comic i would definitely pick it up to check it inside skarsgard brolin momoa bautista are  fun to behold bardem is quite unrecognizable under his make up but he is also working wonders the only one who did not make an impression as an actress who i thought that it doesnt matter who is portraying her was charlotte rampling maybe because of her costume and the fact that it was difficult to distinguish her facial expressions    in general the images were so impressive that i will check the villeneuve films i have not seen yet he is truly an auter and i will delve into craig frasers director of photography works simply amazing    i have already seen it twice in cinema it opened in greece on october 14th and have plans to see it again in cinema i cannot stress enough the importance of viewing it on a movie theater it has to be experienced there with the sound blasting from the speakers it is one of those movies epic stuff
Oct 22 2021,positive,amazing movie oh my gosh
Oct 22 2021,negative,another villeneuve turd that could have been 1 hour instead of 3  like a string of perfume commercials tied together with explosions
Oct 22 2021,positive,beautiful images that will stay with me reminding me of the beauty of film
Oct 22 2021,positive,pivotal scenes from the book brought to life with beautiful cinematography
Oct 22 2021,positive,excellent cinematography and worldbuilding by villeneuve  excellent score  liked the vehicles  liked the choice of casting and their performance for the most part   costumes were okay  honors the book well but there were a few deviations  or things they decided not to cover  i think the main criticism the film will get is in the handling or timing of the end of part 1  it didnt seem to have the gravity that one expects from an ending  all that said as there is a lot of source material to get lost in it could have been a lot worse  looking forward to part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,a masterpiece and i cant wait for the second part warner brothers lets go
Oct 22 2021,positive,so epic without being over the top
Oct 22 2021,positive,it was amazing i love every detail of the movie
Oct 22 2021,positive,the definition of epic
Oct 22 2021,positive,almost as slow as the books i loved it
Oct 22 2021,positive,amazing breath taking beautiful the next lord of the rings
Oct 22 2021,positive,captured so much of the book kept it weird and faithful for the die hards and comprehensible for the new fans
Oct 22 2021,positive,this movie had tons of potential and great characters yet towards the second half of the movie it began to start many different plot lines through these visions that paul had and we were already shown scenes and how they would lay out before it happened because of these visions and it sort of left all the mystery out of what could happen because we already knew seemed our characters were jumping from side quest to side quest this movie is visually stunning and the actors are great this movie seemed like a straight rip off of star wars a new hope in a way this movie seemed to focus on what could happen in future sequels than what was actually going on in that moment another thing i noted is where did brolins character mysteriously disappear off to he had tons of screen time in the first half and was very good and then  hes gone just disappears
Oct 22 2021,positive,a 2h 35m set up for part 2 if that will even happen   it ended and i felt like there was almost no plot at all without seeing part 2  it seemed like a origin story for the main character if anything  the movie is beautiful and sounds great as expected   it would be a much better experience to be able to see part 1  2 in a relative time frame because the ending really left me hanging and honestly in a bad way
Oct 22 2021,positive,havent read the book but ordered it immediately after finishing this movie great cast incredible cinematography wonderful scifi world building half a star short of a perfect review in my own totally subjective opinion because the pacing was sometimes a little slow but also that was part of what made the world feel so rich and lived in watched it on hbo max but i imagine it would be unreal on a big screenimax
Oct 22 2021,positive,if you read dune this is a must see decently faithful to the book with great acting score and visuals
Oct 22 2021,positive,great reimagining of a scifi classic huge fan of the original film denis has captured the books essence and delivers an epic sweeping visual and character feast
Oct 22 2021,positive,pleasantly surprised at how well this translated onscreen little long but overall it was a solid flick thats fun to follow 
Oct 22 2021,positive,it was all great   staying true to the story was key   truly enjoyed the experience and cannot wait for the rest of the story
Oct 22 2021,positive,mesmerizing leaves you wanting more
Oct 22 2021,neutral,found it a bit slow and very confusing and the 3d was somewhat nonexistent
Oct 22 2021,positive,cant wait for part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,perfection i dont know how you could adapt this incredible story to the big screen better than that loved every minute of it
Oct 22 2021,positive,great story and great visuals 
Oct 22 2021,positive,need more hope it doesnt fail 
Oct 22 2021,positive,dune proves once again that denis villeneuve is the master of modern scifi filmmaking by doing what many believed to be impossible for yearsadapting the book and actually making a fantastic and breathtaking film
Oct 22 2021,positive,everything and more than i had hoped for now i must hope that we see the rest made
Oct 22 2021,positive,it was phenomenal the best movie i have ever watched everything was beautiful cant wait to see more
Oct 22 2021,positive,loved the detail few missing parts but in all a good movie
Oct 22 2021,positive,i havent been to a movie theatre in a long time so when the music came on i almost jumped in my seat  every character was extremely good in their roles  no one stood out for me  great mone
Oct 22 2021,positive,sandy spongebob and the worm the movie  dune is just great now is it the next star wars or lord of the rings not even close but this film is definitely a great scifi epic  timothee chalamet is excellent as paul i havent really seen him in much so i didnt know how good at acting he is and this performance shows that he can act i am excited to see his performance in the french dispatch the worms are awesome and giant the worms are really cool  denis villeneuve is an amazing director dune is beautiful i love how it is directed the shots are so well done some shots are taken from above some for a distance and many shots are just beautiful the color grading is great the cinematography is phenomenal some of the best i have seen in the while and the editing is impressive the space shots were really cool and well done i am surprised that this movie only cost 165 million dollars to make  i thought the plot was pretty easy to follow most of the time the spaceships were very cool looking and the helicopter was really interesting i thought that oscar isaac zendaya and stellan skarsgårds performance were pretty good my biggest complaint is that i wish some of the side characters like jason momoa dave batista and josh brolins characters could of been more developed and this film felt like a lot of context setting up part 2  overall dune is impressive but not perfect but i am very excited to see part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,david lynch  denis villeneuve but this dune is better and does frank herbert juatice
Oct 22 2021,positive,i loved it  dune came out in 1965 and i read it in the early 70s in high school  i have reread it several times over the years each time seeing more of the layers in the book   one problem with adapting dune to the screen is the sheer number of layers of motivations politics and belief  villeneuve lets you see enough of each characters why so that you can follow the story  my wife who has not read the book really enjoyed the movie  i look forward to seeing it again
Oct 22 2021,negative,long for no reason gave off star wars vives but the non interesting my bf fell asleep i almost did as well witch never happens i had high hopes for this since im a fan of zendaya and jason momia yet she was not even part of the movie as much the movie also did not have a good story line and just made it longer by putting long very loud sounds and slow motion the ending well lets just say they will make a sequel because the ending was just so disappointing for a 25hr movie this is the first time ever i wrote a review on a movie but i didnt like it at all the trailer gave up the wrong idea of what it could have been
Oct 22 2021,positive,denis villeneuves take on dune is a visual feast with an ambitious scope befitting of its source material  while it drags at times its a true modern epic with all the potential ingredients in place to make it a classic however the jury is still out with part 2 on the way  no other feature has made as strong of a case to do away with splitting up films as much as dune  a movie that doesnt end but stops in the middle with no clear resolution
Oct 22 2021,positive,brilliant if you liked the novel or dune 1984 you will love this sets and battle sequences amazing fantastic character development
Oct 22 2021,positive,one of the best scifi movies i have ever seen great job adapting dune for the big screen you have to watch a movie like this in the theatre its just not the same watching at home cant wait for part 23
Oct 22 2021,negative,not quite as good as buster crabbe in 1948 flash gordon series plot line was about the samei kept waiting for ming the mercilessvfx better than flash gordon but  the story drags so much it was like watching john wick on valium i fell asleep in the middleby the end i was rooting for the worm sure glad i didnt have to spend money to see it its amazing someone would spend millions of dollars to reinvent a movie that was bad the first time
Oct 22 2021,positive,i like the scaling of the worlds different cultures and mysticism
Oct 22 2021,positive,awesome movie and great character development
Oct 22 2021,positive,though it is only part one of a larger story thanks to a wellassembled cast stunning vfx hans zimmers score and denis villeneuves direction combining star wars lord of the rings and game of thrones into one dune part one is a big screen marvel that deserves to be seen in imax or dolby  i give it 5 stars 
Oct 22 2021,positive,it is without a doubt my favorite movie of the year so far 
Oct 22 2021,positive,amazing great casting great acting great music great effects great costumes and sets loved it  cant wait for part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,absolutely gorgeous and the sound design is phenomenal wish we spent a little more time on characters
Oct 22 2021,positive,leaves us with a cliff hanger and there wasnt much character developmentnor enough action scenes in the moviei honestly believe dune should have been a tv show instead of a movieeverything else was perfect and i am looking forward to seeing the sequel
Oct 22 2021,positive,visually stunning but kind of boring
Oct 22 2021,positive,it was phenomenal and met the expectations of someone whos waited over 15 years for it to come out
Oct 22 2021,positive,love love love this film see this movie in imax
Oct 22 2021,positive,being a huge fan of the book i had incredibly high expectations going into this i promise you it will not let you down
Oct 22 2021,positive,great movie the atmosphere ambiance and well assembled characters make it unique cinematic experience those who complain about boring and etc do not understand difficulty of making film adaptation of such complex sciif novel
Oct 22 2021,positive,a sincerely dull bland and slow experience some of these critics must be paid off   much too long of a film lack of good direction boring and waste of a much too large of a budget casting was strange and the main character seems as if he is a 12 year old trying to act like 20 deeply disappointing at best
Oct 22 2021,positive,amazing casting really capturing the depth of the characters and gorgeous visual
Oct 22 2021,positive,dune is absolutely fantastic they stayed true to the original story line and made nice little tweaks to build upon the original the allstar cast did not disappoint and for me the movie perfect
Oct 22 2021,positive,part 1 is in line with the book
Oct 22 2021,positive,amazing already want to see it again
Oct 22 2021,negative,it kinda doesnt make any sense on its own apparently its only part of the story from dune that wasnt mentioned in the advertisement  id give it another watch when they finish the story but on its own this film is garbage storywise
Oct 22 2021,negative,pretentious my friend warned me as soon as he saw the director was denis villeneuve that the movie would be chock full of slowmo pauses and camera pans the entire movie could be described as 12 minutes of real speed actiontalk followed by 3060 seconds of slow pausepan even during conversations the characters take an inordinate amount of time to speak so they can soakup the dramatic pause its absolutely tedious the movie looks great i dont have any major objections to the dialogue or tweaks to the plot i have them but they arent game breaking however i cannot fathom paying to see this movie imagine zach snyder taking his slomo action style but applying it to every single shot of the movie two stars for the excellent costume design other issues the sand worms rise to the top of the sand on their approach then they what dive hundreds of meters below so as to come up directly beneath their prey how does that work how does one explain worm riding if the worms dont breacheverthey just swallow their prey from directly below another oddity was seeing the harkkenon fleets leaving arrakis but their ships were oriented upside down visavis the planet whose orbit they just left in any case those are relatively minor issue the big problem is the pretentious still frames slow pans and deep solemn pauses just run all the slomo at regular speed and youd fit the entire novel into a 25 hour movie gone is the majority of the philosophical critique that dominates the novel replaced by dramatic pause after dramatic pause do yourself a favor read the book and then watch the scyfy channel miniseries its much more true to the spirit of the book orat leastit doesnt slap you in the face with pretensions about its greatness eesh
Oct 22 2021,positive,loved it finally a movie in 2021 that isnt a simple cash grab great cast awesome soundtrack and once again dune as awesome as it gets cheers
Oct 22 2021,negative,way too slow paced and not enough plot action
Oct 22 2021,negative,boring straight up boring chalamet is the least believable leading man besides the cinematography and zendaya this movie is garbage
Oct 22 2021,positive,movie was good slow paced in the beginning but really ramped up towards the end
Oct 22 2021,negative,what a complete mess  did director denis villeneuve even read the book i was so looking forward to this on but i have to say it sucks the visuals are great though
Oct 22 2021,positive,this is my first introduction to the dune franchise and i enjoyed it a lot the score cinematography characters the universe and the feeling when i watched it in theaters it gave me goosebumps i fell in love with this movie so much that i decided to order the first dune book and wanted to learn more about the lore the movie is worth watching if you love movies in general and want a good movie experience
Oct 22 2021,positive,simply an amazing adaptation of the book  cant wait to see the next one
Oct 22 2021,positive,a real blockbuster in 2021
Oct 22 2021,positive,a great story for the first act and sets up perfectly whats to come amazing visual effects and a incredible score without to mention the cinematography
Oct 22 2021,positive,the sets vehicles and score were astounding saw it in rpx and that was definitely the right choice    the plot was incredibly faithful to the book    the acting was really good too    but man the sights and sounds were superb
Oct 22 2021,negative,horrible soundtrack the music was obnoxious and over powering sound effects and dialog often drowned out by the music it was so bad i turned on closed captioning half way through and turned the sound off can we get a directors cut that removes the terrible music
Oct 22 2021,positive,brilliant and visually spectacular but a movie should stand on its own merits i should not have to read the book to get the full grasp of the movie saying that the movie does a nice job explaining things without exposition the first dune 1984 had way too much exposition it even explains things a bit more logically considering the condensed material as they eliminated major plotscharacters unfortunately this movie leaves out critical details like a lasguns effect on a holtzman field shield we have scenes were lasguns are used with impunity in other scene we see what looks like cluster bombs their are a couple of more faults along this line would it kill you to explain who is thufir hawat or what a mentat is  which i will not go into but you know their are issues if you have not read the book and youre left scratching your head wondering why they are not using the lasers to kill everyone and if you read the book youre scratching your head wondering how the hell can they risk subatomic fusion like that
Oct 22 2021,positive,dune is a universal epic that does what movies do best it takes us away to a place inside ourselves dune is a sci fi film set in a universe where computers were banned long ago machinations of noble houses govern the pattern of galaxies its a dangerous place where the confederation of great houses balances itself against the power of the emperor everyone is grasping for a psychedelic substance called spice found only on the sands of arakis spices power is harnessed by three factions mentats specialize in computation and strategy they assist the great houses as advisors bene geserit witches spend their lives training to understand humans our emotions our motivations and our weaknesses the navigators guild is the group that facilitates space travel without them no one could travel between planets all three groups require spice and everyone would do anything to secure it       in this movie the heads of two great houses are pitted against each other duke leto atreides played by oscar iasic inspires loyalty in his followers baron vladimir harkonnen played by stellan skarsgård rules with cruelty skarsgård needs only a few lines to make you wish hed evaporate in a horrible death but the hollywood gods arent so kind his baron harkonnen is equal parts haunting and pitiful       more important than politics to this movie though is physical ecology location guides the path of your experience through the nearly 3 hour runtime living setting not plot or character is the most important aspect of dune and this setting does not disappoint filmed in the united arab emirates norway and jordan this gigantic project immerses you in its global scale from the rocky coastlines of caladan to the haunting desert moons of arrakis our characters are just specks on a larger horizon specks they might be but theyre specks that youll love and youll hate graphic effects supervised by paul lambert take you past the screen in his departments hands sand splashes like water in the wake of  arakass giant worms they make moons hovering above the horizon and the blue on blue eyes of fremen equally stupefying         timothée chalamet does frank herberts paul atredies justice he casts a regal shape that inspires hope and curiosity as the main character he moves through each decision with restraint and implicit capability hes assisted by his mother a trained bene gesserit your heart will be touched by the mothers love thats shown by lady jessica played by rebecca fergison tears might even touch your cheeks as you watch her guide her son on the rough dessert planet of arrakis among the atreides staff duncan idaho played by jason mamoa is a shining gem in this performance mamoa combines solderly kindness with barely controlled beastliness to grant his character a screengrabbing magnetism duncan idaho will be one of your favorite characters thats saying something with this allstar cast sharon duncan brewster is perfectly cast as ecologist leitkines she will leave you knowing that theres a hidden depth to her story as great as an entire lawrence of arabia       every element combines in this film to give you the best movie experience this side of the century you should try to remember who you were before you went into the theater because youre not going to leave it as exactly the same person at dunes core is the importance of honor and responsibility youll be reminded to be a better man dune will inspire you to believe that this is a thing worth doing youll stand straighter youll look further and youll wish the rest of the world would see what you just saw
Oct 22 2021,positive,the best movie of the years
Oct 22 2021,positive,i loved this movie frkn great story line and incredible actors im pissed that theres not already a part 2 wtf
Oct 22 2021,neutral,didnt need to be 23500 at all
Oct 22 2021,positive,best screen version of dune ever ive seen the others even jodorowskys dune doc read all the books twice and no film before repd the books this well
Oct 22 2021,negative,love all of villeneuves other films this was trash editing and score were especially horrible every meaningless criticism that was lobbed at br2049 rings true with regards to dune huge disappointment
Oct 22 2021,positive,fantastic masterpiece music and visuals and acting 
Oct 22 2021,positive,movie felt alive and not just another flashy overly polished scifisuperhero
Oct 22 2021,positive,i love the book and this was amazing and more than i could have ever imagined most visually impressive and innovative film i have ever seen very true to the book as well amazing performance from timothee chalamet as paul was on the edge of my seat the entire time
Oct 22 2021,positive,really enjoy the movie just to long
Oct 22 2021,positive,i could not be more happy everything i wanted and i thought it was phenomenal part 2 i can only pray for it if you love dune you will love this movie
Oct 22 2021,positive,i loved the cinematography of the film interesting story that i havent seen before i felt engaged and am interested to see more a true scifi movie for sure
Oct 22 2021,positive,this movie is the best scifi universe cinema adaptation ive seen in the last 2 decades truly a new era of science fiction that reignites the passion i found watching star wars as a kid this movie punishes audiences who are not willing to keep their full attention on the movie and there is a lot of exposition being blabbed but ultimately this movie does not conform to the pace of modern cinema but takes a more classical approach to story telling instead of demanding your attention with an action sequence every 20 minutes to keep your adolescents attention this movie decides to build the world and atmosphere and doesnt seem to cater to whether or not you will stay engaged to many that is a critique but to me its refreshing to see something that is made without the breakneck pace i would compare its pace to that of the 2001 movie count of monte christo dune is a must see in imax and will leave you addicted to more its clear that this movie was made from a group of people who have great love for the dune novels
Oct 22 2021,neutral,dune isnt a movie  its act 1 of a movie  i wasnt bored watching but without all the plot i just ask myself whats the point  assuming the studio greenlights part 2 wait to watch this one until it comes out so you get the full experience
Oct 22 2021,positive,epic movie worth every minute
Oct 22 2021,positive,is there a 2nd movie  seems like there should be a 2nd movie
Oct 22 2021,negative,the movie did a lot of setup for an amazing finish or even a solid ending for a sequel but it doesnt lead to anywhere worthwhile
Oct 22 2021,neutral,spectacular sets amazing music sweepingly huge canvas all good  but  none of this eye and ear candy can mask the one huge problem in this film its boring it reminds me of an endless meeting in an unairconditioned room everyone is dressed great the technology is amazing but its still nod off land
Oct 22 2021,positive,dune is by far one of if not the best movies ive seen in the last 5 years truly going to be the of our generation movie just like lord of the rings was in the early 2000s i cannot find a single fault in the entire film nothing     do yourself a favor please read the book even if you are going to see it go back and read the book it makes it so the better     denis villeneuve this is my love letter to you you sir are an amazing human and i love you
Oct 22 2021,positive,best movie ive seen in awhile  i like old movies because they are often more moving than movies from last the last twenty years  this had the feel of an older classic epic  slower paced in a good way beautiful cinematography haunting music and great direction  i definitely recommend seeing this one in the theater
Oct 22 2021,positive,dune profits from its rich source material and stunning cinematography see this film
Oct 22 2021,negative,incredibly boring it was two hours of watching someone get visions zero good action scenes wait for free streaming
Oct 22 2021,positive,already dying for a pt 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,epic visual effects building a story star wars fashion
Oct 22 2021,positive,been a long time since i read the book but the movie seemed very faithful to the book even having the bulls head hanging on the wall didnt realize that this was only part1 part 2 wont be made until the box office figures justify a second part
Oct 22 2021,negative,that was a pretty awful movie  i just rewatched the syfy dune miniseries right before and it was significantly better than this new one  the effects were at times amazing and beautifully vastdarkhaunting but everything else was boring and dragged on and on  please just end i said in my head over and over lol
Oct 22 2021,positive,captivating from start to finish
Oct 22 2021,positive,epic the last time i felt like this was the fellowship of the ring please give us part 2 and dune messiah
Oct 22 2021,negative,this movie was so slow takes forever to get to a point nothing will ever make me want to watch this again
Oct 22 2021,positive,wow just wow its not often i am totally blown away by a hollywood film these days but wow
Oct 22 2021,positive,captivated me the whole time
Oct 22 2021,positive,amazing unlike any movie ever cinematically austere grandeur maybe insterstellar was closest to the scope see it in imax    be aware it is slow lots of story to build
Oct 22 2021,positive,this was the movie i wanted it to be the casting was perfect and the acting was on point the cadence was good and i liked the fact that they split it in two rather than try to stuff every thing into one movie i hope there is an extended version out there i loved the foreshadowing and the suspense such a great scfi movie my only complaint is that they havent greenlit the second one yet so i have to waithopefully for the second one
Oct 22 2021,negative,this movie bored me to death fell asleep during the movie aswell jason momoa was great tho
Oct 22 2021,positive,amazing movie  perfect setup for multiple franchise movies   timothée chalamet and rebecca ferguson exceeded my expectation for the movie  jason momoa deserves his own prequel trilogy of movies
Oct 22 2021,positive,non stop eye candy amazing movie 1010
Oct 22 2021,negative,this is an awful movie i have read the book and got a book adaptation its the worst ive seen this decade they leave so many important details out that it makes any important scene meaningless i had to keep explaining the meaning of things to those that were watching it with me for them to understand what was going on its just awful
Oct 22 2021,positive,denis villeneuve made a spectacular movie i have read the book and it stuck very close to the book there were some things they left out but nothing that was cut was i sad to see go the source material is expansive and full of detail i was hoping they didnt ruin it more than anything  the movie is aware of how grandiose the material is but also doesnt overdo it     my wife and kids have no connection to the book and all three loved it my wife cant wait for the second part
Oct 22 2021,positive,its essentially what dune fans hoped for its faithful so far while being as conservative as it can be with the world building items cut felt deliberate to not overwhelm but it still threw a lot out there    some scenes moved slow which isnt my choice but overall a great adaptation of the material
Oct 22 2021,positive,outstanding job cast script cgi very excited for the next and ill hate that long wait
Oct 22 2021,positive,the amazing immersive unique scifi world what a beautiful way to tell this amazing story and i cant wait to see more
Oct 22 2021,positive,an extremely spectacular movie since the book is not super descriptive denis decided to visualize it all for us a job well done a scream was let out from the audience at the end teeing up the second part a purely wild ride 1010
Oct 22 2021,positive,wonderful adaptation of the book well crafted and clearly a dan of the themes and tons of easter eggs
Oct 22 2021,positive,a masterfully directed adaptation of the famous book denis villeneuve directed my favorite movie blade runner 2049 and once again he delivers with dune    the pacing of the story was crucial and denis got it right it slows down where necessary to allow you to immerse yourself in this fictional world but speeds up right in time to keep you glued to your seat    the story focuses on 2 characters and their performances hold up pretty well im intrigued to see how the story concludes     the visuals as with all of denis movies are impeccable the cinematography captures the grandure of the world but also the harshness sublime i will watch this movie again
Oct 22 2021,positive,excellent it was everything i hoped it would be  truly epic
Oct 22 2021,positive,i liked it but i ultimately felt underwhelmed with it aside from the spectacle of it all i never really fully connected with the story on the levels that i wanted
Oct 22 2021,positive,a perfect adaptation of the book among the greatest si fi movies of all time for sure
Oct 22 2021,positive,i feel denis has nailed the visual depiction of the dune world well hes very talented at telling a visual story with set pieces costumes and nonverbal communication of the actors however i think this movie is dialogue lite and doesnt inform a casual moviegoer enough of the finer details of the dune setting
Oct 22 2021,positive,i could have watched 810 hours of this easy
Oct 22 2021,positive,great movie follows the book very well wish it was rated r 
Oct 22 2021,positive,this film hits all the right spots if you are an artsy film lover or just a book nerd and love the dune book then this masterpiece is for you it is so well crafted and follows the book better than most booktomovie films do     the music composed by hans zimmer is a true work of art it captures the emotion of every scene perfectly the film itself feels so raw and real which many sififantasy films lack but this one does not lack that one bit rather it takes the budget spent on this movie and uses every penny to make you feel like you are watching a moving work of art because you truly are    they have said this movie is the new star wars or the new lord of the rings before watching it i didnt believe it but after watching it i fully understand and i think you will too
Oct 22 2021,positive,dont lower your expectations raise them this is the vision weve been wanting and waiting for so very long now i am a huge fan of the 1984 film it occupies a special nostalgic place in my heart and those of my sons who were only being born that is a high mark to equal and it has been surpassed 
Oct 22 2021,positive,well done thank you its only the beginning
Oct 22 2021,positive,absolutely fantastic movie this was an incredible reboot and its so great that its in multiple parts 1010 i wont say more
Oct 22 2021,positive,like how it stayed on line with book  better action better story more detail
Oct 22 2021,positive,it was good it was a very noisy movie like nonstop sound gave me a headache but the storyline seemed familiar overall it was good but very long
Oct 22 2021,positive,dune is a great visual of a movie well paced for the length of the movie stunning characters that leave you wanting more heres hoping for part 2
Oct 22 2021,neutral,jason momoa cant seem to deliver a line without mumbling or sounding like hes in a damned socal buddy comedy josh brolin who i normally find to be a good actor had a similar issue with line delivery timothee chalamet was far too awkward in a very uncharming way and his delivery was a bit mumbly at times as well and just once id like to see desert dwellers not modeled after arabic cultures on planet earth oh wait david lynch already avoided that trite pitfall in the original dune picture    i really wanted to like this and its not all bad javier bardem and almost all of the fremen actors do quite well but im scratching my head at some of these casting choices  i will say that stellan skarsgard did a good job as baron harkonnen for the most part but again lynchs baron reveling in disease and foul industrial imagery paints such a more fascinating picture of the nature of the harkonnen savagery and disgust    the one thing that i cannot forgive though is the rushed and absurdly soft take on the box of pain scene ive never seen less character development or less intensity in a scene like that it is unforgivable and baffling to me why it was done so weakly    there are a lot of very questionable line deliveries that do not make for an immersive experience much of the acting seems forced and incompatible as though the cast was not absorbed in the moment of the picture the accents and diction of speech were inconsistent across the actors like there was no attempt to make each group sound like theyre from the same place it also felt emotionally piecemeal and incongruent for most of the picture this is extremely disappointing and all of the visual grandeur is meaningless if you dont have appropriate acting it feels like they lost sight of that    it also felt like a lot of the effects were afterthoughts the voice of the bene gesserit order was not very compelling compared to our original frame of reference that was lynchs incredible sounddesign i know people are going to say that we ought to avoid comparing the two films but guess what that is inevitable and the only reason people say that is because they know this picture will fall short of the images and sounds of lynchs film this picture cannot be viewed in a vacuum if something has been done better in the past already then remaking a picture is nothing but an act of hubris and greed
Oct 22 2021,positive,this is by far the finest adaption of this material the wife who has no knowledge of anything dune really enjoyed it too its beautiful and epic and unforgettable oh and that surround mix
Oct 22 2021,negative,pretty to look at but like the book and other movie the material is just typical and boring
Oct 22 2021,positive,a visual masterpiece great acting by all it left me wanting more
Oct 22 2021,positive,this movie was everything and more of what i expected loved the action story and graphics stayed true to the book
Oct 22 2021,positive,this is only the beginning 
Oct 22 2021,positive,this dune conveyed the sinister atmosphere and spectre of the book which for me was more important than covering the source material in an overly comprehensive way which could have make it too pedantic or killed it with over editing     visual effects were great sound effects were great and the score was immersive and raw chalamet should have worked out a bit to fit the role and the fight scenes werent very well choreographed but the movie got a lot right     brolin momoa and bardem all stood out and the rest had their moments skarsgard was sufficiently brutal isaac and ferguson were great too the worms stillsuits ornithopters laser beams ships ordnance etc and the rest were all made believable as was the whole imperium itself and the worlds presented within it     ultimately dune was transposed from the book to the big screen in a magical way overall especially considering the immense challenge presented by the scope of the book which is why so many who have read the book as i have are impressed with this
Oct 22 2021,positive,the best movie i seeing in years i cannot wait for more great way to sell the story and to create that tension that grabs the attention from beginning to ending
Oct 22 2021,positive,despite great cinematography it is far from perfect  pacing is flawed acting feels mostly by the numbers the truly emotionally evoking moments are few and far between because you often feel almost too distanced from the characters in question to empathize with them or you havent been given the time to soak in what they feel before the movie is forced to move to the next step in the plot  the pacing somehow feels both rushed when it comes to getting from one plot point to the next and yet feels too slow when it comes to the establishment of characters relationships with each other or giving them the time to express important inner monologues  for many characters it was very hard to care about them without having previously read the books
Oct 22 2021,positive,loved it beautiful scenery visual fulfilling
Oct 22 2021,positive,visuals were off the charts especially the ships and the building sets   it gave the feel of blade runner 2049 in scope    development of the characters has long way to go but was decent at what was shown    this is part one of multiple parts of this version of dune
Oct 22 2021,positive,if you are a fan of the books you will be able to recognize this movie was made by someone who cares about the source material  unfortunately he might care too much  the scenes that he developed on his own seem to be the ones that i liked the most
Oct 22 2021,positive,this is definitely more wordy scifi than action and dont get me wrong thats not a bad thing there are quite a few action packed moments but keep in mind this part is here to set the background of what the story is its refreshing to have an scifi movie that isnt nonstop action that actually has an in depth and deep story that is being told very well done adaptation i cannot wait for the next part
Oct 22 2021,positive,it feels like theres several visual cues to the lynch version and a few scenes that remind me of things i only caught in the novel    the sound mixing for hbo max in the browser doesnt seem correct for home systems so be ready for difficult dialogue or distorted music
Oct 22 2021,positive,it was so good the cast the cinematography soundtrack everything it was so fresh i hope they have a second one recommending to all my friends
Oct 22 2021,positive,very faithful to the book 100 recommend
Oct 22 2021,positive,as a fan of the book i thought the movie was fantastic it was an incredible spellbinding work of cinema
Oct 22 2021,positive,much better than the dune movies before it also it was a cinematic experience that must be seen in imax
Oct 22 2021,positive,beautiful cinematography and visually stunning this movie was full of unexpected surprises give us part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,it went quick for 25hrs dune is an immense world and story that wasnt able to be adequately captured on film before denis villeneuve does an incredible job conveying the scope and awesomeness of dune as a fan of the books i think this was incredible cant wait for part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,frank herberts originally published scifi novel titled dune was noted as the bestselling scifi novel in the world in 2003 it has sold over 20 million copies worldwide it is a story that has been described as incorporating politics religion ecology technology and human emotion it is a story and a movie that will keep you waiting anxiously for the next scene the evolution of the story line and resolution of the everexpanding conflicts constantly developing on the big screen the simple fact being that the 2 hour and 35minute epic will have you wanting the story to continue beyond the finality of the end appearing on the screen your vocabularies will increase to include arrakis the planet on which the story will evolve mélange  the drug spice that can only be found on arrakis and which extends life and enhances mental acuity bene gesserit  a secret society of women sand worms  giant inhabitants of arrakis and freman the inhabitants of the planet arrakis this is a fascinating story of power sought and mystical realities influencing control of the universe and all its inhabitants the expansion of comparisons to a contemporary society are inevitable and realistic accept the fact that scifi and drama are not mutually exclusive and that the bestselling scifi novel of all time may have a compelling story line worth the time you invest in this big screen spectacular  one might hope that the sequel to the 2021 dune will not take the 5 years of negotiations and development that the 2021 final production took before sharing this epoch with an appreciative audience  rating i  b  c  r  imagination becomes creative reality
Oct 22 2021,negative,too long minimal character development
Oct 22 2021,positive,dune is a great story and this is the best adaptation of dune out there id be very disappointed if nothing is made of this movie and it doesnt continue i want more not in a year not in two or three years but now this scifi adventure blew my mind and the music in this film is probably the best ive heard from hans zimmer in my opinion this is a must watch i watched it on hbo max but im definitely seeing it in theaters tomorrow
Oct 22 2021,positive,totally worth checking out great start to what could be an amazing cinematic universe makes you want to read the books
Oct 22 2021,positive,beautiful just beautiful worth to watch it in imax will watch again cant wait for next one
Oct 22 2021,positive,this movie is for the one who are capable to suspense their belive very well and be ok with not understanding what is happening rhigh at moment of watching   the movie is very nuanced and the world building is astonishing
Oct 22 2021,positive,part 1 of a saga that is over due to have its time in the spotlight the script was well written and the acting solid although the movie differed from the book a few times it still kept true to the majority of frank herberts master piece im already looking forward to part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,i never saw the old movie or read the book so was not really sure what to expect there is a certain grandiose and ambition to the whole movie cinematography was great acting was good it was also very slow i couldnt help but think why this director didnt direct the new star wars trilogy
Oct 22 2021,positive,visually stunning tonally interesting with just a dash of political intrigue villanueves dune is a worthy torchbearer of herberts original novel and i greatly look forward to future installments
Oct 22 2021,positive,this movie is absolutely phenomenal everything about it is just top notch scifi worth going to the movies for     please go out support this film so we can get part 2 this is clearly a set up movie to whats to come
Oct 22 2021,positive,the most amazing film ive ever seen the sound was just fucking incredible
Oct 22 2021,positive,this is a great experience on the big screen the film is a great start i am looking forward to a sequel
Oct 22 2021,positive,beautiful visuals amazing soundtrack great acting a must see on the biggest screen available
Oct 22 2021,negative,if i didnt love the book i wouldnt have bothered watching the whole thing astonishing how they could at once skip over vital character development and world building and famous scenes while also making the movie feel so sluggish and slow paced you are waiting for it to be over i expected it to be truncated given the feat of putting dune to the big screen but i did not expect the cinematography set and costume design to be so bland
Oct 22 2021,positive,astonishing visuals and a moody deliberate pace those unfamiliar with the novel are likely to feel a bit lost but stick with it its worth it
Oct 22 2021,positive,denis villeneuves vision came to life and it was amazing to watch
Oct 22 2021,positive,i just got out of the theater seeing dune and it is a true cinemtatic and visual masterpiece i was completely hooked for the whole movie the cast was completely perfect and i simply loved timothee chalamet as paul atriedes and rebecca fergeson as lady jessica well worth the watch  and if you want so see the movie you need to see it in the theater seeing it at home on hbo max is really not worth it the theater will be the absolute best experience
Oct 22 2021,positive,fantastic some truly haunting scenes and images i did not give it a perfect score because i would prefer a little more character development though nonsubstantive spoiler i also felt that the cut from this part one to the to be continued mark was a bit abrupt and annoying there needs to be some kind of closure between films even if its a tbc
Oct 22 2021,positive,i just finished watching dune movie at amc tyngsboro and visually this movie is very stunning i went it a blank slate not knowing anything about the frank herbert stories so that i can see for myself as to what kind of film this is going to be this film felt very much like john carter of mars meets star wars series meets shakespeares hamlet and romeo  juliet into one giant story its very much about accepting your birthright and timothee chalamets paul atreides has this inner conflict whether to take his fathers throne or become the messiah by saving arrakis the borderline uninhabitable desert world where spice is found spice is the income that keeps the house of atreides in power or it could destroy them if they fail in their duties the main catalyst is paul atreides and the conflict he goes through which is explored throughout this first part of the story i will say chalamets performance is great and again just brings depth and dimension to the role the central storyline with his character is that he felt betrayed by his mom and is having a tough time accepting her apology thats the main focus of this story which leads dangerous journeys on the deserts of arrakis even the battle between harkonnens and atreides builds some astonishing visuals where some are beautiful and others are just horrifying all these are fun to watch on a big screen the grand scale look is what i take away from this film and whether it gets a sequel is a question since it depends on the success of the first film i want this film to succeed so that denis villeneuve gets to continue the stories of frank hubert overall for me it was a 910
Oct 22 2021,positive,denis villeneuves best film and a perfect adaptation
Oct 22 2021,positive,this movie was amazing
Oct 22 2021,positive,the sense of scale is incredible the soundtrack is downright relentless pee before you go in its long also its part of a series so dont expect the full story however it stops at a good point great scifi super excited for part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,the best movie of the year 2021
Oct 22 2021,positive,finally a new story and not a sequel looking forward to the next one
Oct 22 2021,positive,much better than i had hoped bound to end up as a legendary masterpiece of the genre
Oct 22 2021,positive,amazing every scene looked beautiful
Oct 22 2021,positive,having hans zimmer rattle through my bones at imax was its own desert spice  i love it  it is how i imagined it while reading the book  gawd more more kylo ren voice
Oct 22 2021,positive,i went to watch duna at the cinema today and people what an event what a beautiful movie the excellent performances of course and the lighting destroyed me it was so good about the story i had seen only 2 trailers and for me it was all very intuitive i want more watch the imax cinema because of the immersion
Oct 22 2021,positive,amazing visually shocking true to the book the whole cinema burst in claps at the end
Oct 22 2021,positive,finally an on screen adaptation worthy of the dune story absolutely loved it visually stunning from start to finish
Oct 22 2021,positive,amazing impressive beautiful as a fan of the books i had high hopes and theyere met and surpassed
Oct 22 2021,positive,maybe the most visually incredible scifi film ive ever seen every frame is pure art very cinematic amazing sets amazing costumes amazing design and aesthetics all around all that said film is kind of a bore it never really grabbed me in the way i hoped probably the first villeneuve film that evoked very little emotion from me theres hardly any sense of forward momentum and the exciting scenes are quickly undercut by long slomo dream sequences and sweeping landscape shots also dont love chamalet in this role as paul atreides it just feels like he has one expression and one tone of voice for the entire filmhes just boring to watch unfortunately dune is pure cinema and im a huge villeneuve fan but if im being honest i dont think theres enough here to attract the general audience that it needs for the studio to greenlight a second installment kind of a disappointment because ive been looking forward to this film for two years
Oct 22 2021,positive,it was okay starts slow and kinda stays this pace 
Oct 22 2021,positive,so much more than i expected the cinematography the acting the music the special effects the costumes the sets its amaznig they have to give us part ii
Oct 22 2021,positive,though it is only part one of a larger story thanks to a wellassembled cast stunning vfx hans zimmers score and denis villeneuves direction combining star wars lord of the rings and game of thrones into one dune part one is a big screen marvel that deserves to be seen in imax or dolby  i give it 5 stars 
Oct 22 2021,positive,amazing special effects fantastic casting disappointed to wait for part ii 
Oct 22 2021,positive,cinematography is absolutely breathtaking it has quite a build up but as someone who doesnt mind i think its well worth it
Oct 22 2021,negative,rancid piece of worm droppings may this movie chip and shatter at the box office
Oct 22 2021,positive,absolutely great cannot wait for part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,dune delivers everything that is expected chalamet is pitch perfect going from boy to man and the pacing is indulgent but acceptable for the scale of the medieval fantasy on display a modern fellowship i am stoked for part two
Oct 22 2021,negative,i am dune fanatic for life both the book and the 1984 movie this new dune part i is such a disappointment for me i am not comparing this movie to the original 1984 adaptation or the extended edition my two star rating is based on the emotions or should i say the lack of emotions this movie brought out in me paul was portrayed as a child needing his mothers protection rather than the strong dukes son the lady jessica was flipped back and forth as weepy strong anxious and confused woman please make her one thing or another while visually i enjoyed parts of the movie the its self lost my interest every quickly and the ending point for their part i was a big let down not the cliff hanger i believe it was suppose to present so many points were lost verbiage mutilated and meanings obscured i would not recommend to see this or purchase it at a later date this will not be added to my vast movie collection  so sad as i was looking forward to this movie
Oct 22 2021,positive,never read the book or have seen the previous movies and found this one very intriguing beautiful to look at and excited to explore past versions and looking forward to future movies
Oct 22 2021,positive,a dazzling piece of science fiction cinema
Oct 22 2021,negative,in this era the subject matter of the film is out of date  not to mention the boring action design and shooting techniques  spending a lot of money cant cover up the fact that the plot is barren  probably only elementary school students will enjoy it
Oct 22 2021,positive,this movie is amazing the semi toggery fee was outstanding the sound was incredible and they picked the right characters to be the right people and what was also amazing was he didnt try to shame all the same movie within three hours its a twopart which is shouldve been back in the 80s go see this movie
Oct 22 2021,positive,not only does denis villeneuves dune present a rich story and beautiful visuals but it also kicks off what looks to be an extraordinary franchise even if its first outing takes its sweet time teasing a climax that is yet to be reached     movies decoded youtube
Oct 22 2021,negative,so i have seen the new dune i am impressed at the production yet it has deviated from the books greatly in just the first half of the first book with 6 books in the dune series not going into prequels there is a lot to look forward to to change so quickly into a set story line means the changes will only get worse some storyline features were done perfectly like battle language thopters resembling bugs and others yet the changes will ultimately destroy the storyline irreparably feyd was never introduced pauls training and skills was skipped over weirding way training was ignored thufirs sound weapons also ignored vast amounts of backstory and intellectual understanding left out nothing about the navigators or history leading to present day politics       as visually entertaining as this movie is it comes off as a poor cliff notes version of a monumental storyline the 1984 version did the best it could with the technology of film and limited time constraints but it had more quality and loyalty to the books which even herbert said he loved it the 2000 miniseries was the truest to the books yet visually limited by budgets this ultimately falls into the category of books that cannot be put into film properly or at the least the production company capable still does not exist i enjoyed it at several points but continued to be disappointed more over see the movie but be aware it is not dune it is a reinvention  as a reader of the entire series fan of herberts art this is a travesty and cannot endorse this failure years waiting in anticipation have been a waste of emotion like boarding a roller coaster that ultimately only goes in circles on flat ground
Oct 22 2021,negative,waste of my time slowmoving no background information
Oct 22 2021,positive,visuals  stunning story felt like something was missing
Oct 22 2021,positive,epic visuals stellar casting and great acting but the story was convoluted and plotless in the 155 min runtime of boredom    im sure anyone thats read the novel may have a better understanding of wtf was happening but to me this was a long dragged out middle episode of a series i wasnt following    all the visions  of which most were tacky really resolved to nothingness i know this is only supposed to be the first part of two but leaving the viewer with not much to root for or care about does not make an inviting viewing to any part 2    i also found timothée chalamet annoying as his character not sure why but he didnt convince me    although the score was typical hans zimmer amazing i had difficulty understanding most of the dialogue when it was mixed in with the score    i hope many of the complexities of the story become more explanatory in part 2 but im not going to hold my breath    sadly even with all its high budget esthetics the lack of any cohesive story gets a 810 from me and i know it couldve been more
Oct 22 2021,positive,perfect in every way
Oct 22 2021,positive,simply a masterpiece by denis villeneuve watch it in cinema if you can cant wait for part ii
Oct 22 2021,positive,a massive widescreen adaptation of a classic scifi novel that was thought to be unadaptable if anyone could do it though it would be the person who made blade runner 2049 one of the best scifi films in many years denis villeneuve has finally done what no one was able to do before him and make a dune film that not only works but is one of the best science fiction films in decades the slow pace and borderline surreal imagery is just intoxicating aside from an anticlimactic ending this is a display in filmmaking perfection and something to really appreciate as the stunning work of art that it is my full review with cohost deanna on our filmscape podcast anchorfmfilmscapepodcastepisodes36dunee19butk
Oct 22 2021,positive,the movie was incredible needs to be seen in theaters give me part 2 asap
Oct 22 2021,positive,super good just like the book
Oct 22 2021,positive,loved it reeeeally hope we get that part ii
Oct 22 2021,positive,tackling dune was hugely ambitious  denis villeneuve swung for the fences  its a grand slam bravo denis et merci
Oct 22 2021,positive,fantastic adaptation and looking forward for all the books
Oct 22 2021,positive,this movie is gorgeous definitely needs to be seen on a big screen the score and sound are insane ive never heard anything like it and it gives the movie a certain tone that can be unsettling at times but is overall a joy to watch and listen to the movie is certainly not a full story it leaves a lot for the next part to pick up and can be a bit confusing at times for those unfamiliar with everything like myself but mostly its easy enough to figure out whats happening i do wish we got a bit more in pauls headspace for his arcs sake but so much of his arc is incomplete its hard to judge yet on that front a lot i think will depend on the next movie but this alone is certainly worth the watch and while i cant say im super invested in the characters right now the visuals and audio made the experience worthwhile on its own the battles and fighting scenes were also super fun
Oct 22 2021,neutral,im normally a huge villeneuve fan but this was a tedious film while the visuals are spectacular and immersive the story was dense and didnt make a ton of sense to me i feel like fans of the original dune story will be in heaven here die hard scifi fans may rejoice as well but for a person not familiar with the source material this film will be a chore also felt incomplete being that its only half the story
Oct 22 2021,positive,loved it  im a longtime fan of frank herbert and this was about as good as a dune adaptation could be  i was terrified to watch this fearing another disappointment  i was not disappointed
Oct 22 2021,positive,the best adaptation from the books to film i really hope that this trilogy is finished an not left just as a single film
Oct 22 2021,negative,thank god i watched it hbo max and didnt spend money an utter waste of time i only contemplated suicide twice hence the two stars the original was better and thats sad all this time passed and this is what comes out plus socially correct crap made it worse 
Oct 22 2021,positive,this is one of the greatest book to film adaptations ive ever seen the acting incredible the sound design and scoring off the charts the set and vehicle design is stunning and all ill see in my head when i read the book again
Oct 22 2021,positive,great movie some of my favorite parts of the book where cut but i can understand that they wouldnt be very interesting on screen very nice visuals and sound design
Oct 22 2021,positive,the first 45 minutes are slow but needed as it is a lot of worldbuilding and setup for a dense story the next hour plus is filled with fun action and great acting as someone who as never read the book i loved the world and story being told really enjoyed the look and feel of the movie as well definite recommend
Oct 22 2021,positive, all strata of the human being summed up in one masterpiece of cinema    from its most complex layers to the simplest ones from the most joyful or deeply human moments to the most horrible or deeply inhuman moments sometimes raw and dark as life can be sometimes wonderful and magical as life can be    a universal saga in infinitely more ways than one a mythology filled with values and philosophies colliding with one another a multiplicity of beliefs where certainties and uncertainties are entwined with one another like two inseparable snakes seeking each other without ever finding each other    mystical and evanescent as well as concrete and visceral dreams and premonitions choices and actions space and time or where the role that you play is written but is not has already taken place but never will    a cinematographic fresco that is immensely majestic and glorious like the greatest of paintings or the greatest of concertos     it answers everything while questioning you about everything because it is simply giving you the pure truth    ps  from the entire casting and their performances to the cinematographyphotographydesign  visual language as a whole to the actionchoregraphymusiccostumes the staging and overall atmosphere the loreworld building its entire mythology and its codes with countless messages and layers everything in this movie is pure mastery pure genius
Oct 22 2021,positive,much appreciated that they didnt try to overdo a movie so enriched in story with a bunch of bing bang boom beautiful science fiction at its best
Oct 22 2021,positive,this is the dune ive been waiting for 
Oct 22 2021,positive,true to the david lynch version in every way that matters and better in many ways and incredible casting
Oct 22 2021,positive,boooya imax does the story justice
Oct 22 2021,positive,this is the dune movie fans have always deserved
Oct 22 2021,negative,unless you know the books you do not really have a clue what is going on until about 1 hour 40 minute mark after that you think you know what is going     stellan skarsgard plays the bad guy he literally played the same character as he played in the movie king arthur same speech talk same facial expressions same acting i was like hey that is  the king arthur villain i didnt even know that was him in the king arthur movie had to go back and check
Oct 22 2021,negative,thought this was a hold movie but its just advertisement for another movie
Oct 22 2021,negative,the movie was beyond bland the visual effects of the planet arrakis are amazing and really one of the only things this movie has going for it as for the script you cant really ever get into the movie because you know whats going to happen before it does also the characters have no development whatsoever and just make this possibly the most boring movie of the year so far i will give credit where it is due and that is with the visual effects other than that this movie is a watch once wont ever watch again
Oct 22 2021,negative,dune is tough its a slog and takes only halfway there honestly preferred the miniseries from way back even that wasnt perfect dune definitely needs more episodes to work    watch the expanse instead or the foundationinnameonly series
Oct 22 2021,positive,definitely a redemption for dune cant wait for part 2
Oct 22 2021,positive,ive never seen the original movie or read the novel so i went into this completely fresh and im glad i did a captivating scifi story that mixes politics eye popping technology gorgeous visual fx and a rock solid casttimothée chalamet plays paul atreides the son of duke leto atreides played by oscar isaac the atreides are a powerful family within the galaxy and as such the emperor has given them the planet of arrakis a dessert planet thats home to the most precious commodity in the galaxy spice however arrakis is already being ruled and plundered by the harkonnen family thus making the two families enemies when the emperor takes it away from the harkonnens to gift to the atreides the fremen or natives on arrakis live underground is home to dangerous sand worms and is so hot that without the proper equipment and water people die rather quickly the harkonnens ravaged the planet for its resources and paid no attention to the fremen however now with the atreides in power they wish to make peace with the them very impressive performances all around especially in regards to the motherson duo of chalamet who is very mature for a 26yearold actor and rebecca ferguson i hope this does well in the theaters and hbo max as id love to see the next installment and continue on this storys journey definitely worth your time to check it out
Oct 22 2021,positive,dune could become a franchise with the kind of worldbuilding this movie explores it demands it this is only the beginning
Oct 22 2021,negative,i have a phd and have no idea whatsoever what this movie is about zero plot waste worthless 
Oct 22 2021,positive,its two parts i could sit here for six hours or more to see it all i had read the book many decades agosaw the first did not like saw the previous version and love it  this new one is amazing did not disappoint
Oct 22 2021,positive,amazing scenery cinematography was amazing  loved all the actors
Oct 22 2021,positive,rebecca ferguson was a major anchor in this movie and kept it from falling apart  the other actors are talented in their own right but failed to provide as much substantial weight and provide linearity to the story which felt overall fragmented and incoherent  it could have been the chronology of how it was shot or the editing itself as the movie also did not need to be dragged out as long as it did  there were many empty cuts just displaying equipment here and there leaving you feeling underwhelmed overall  art direction failed to impress just exaggerated architectural proportions appropriated for the epic genre
Oct 22 2021,positive,the only con is that its long but it needs to be long to keep the pace of the movie good with the amount of story they tell i didnt catch on to any social justice pandering or 20 minute filler shots the action is good and not gory for the sake of shock this is how action adventure over are supposed to be made
Oct 22 2021,positive,amazing the trama awesome and the scenes of the spaceships are so fucking increíble  1010
Oct 22 2021,positive,great reimagining of a great story
Oct 22 2021,neutral,gets kind of boring sets up what seems to be a cool movie series not a ton of excitement for the long runtime but the movie looks amazing
Oct 22 2021,positive,and whether you have read the books or not this movie is profound and should be experienced in a theater several times i cannot wait to watch it again incredibly thoughtful subtle and visually stunning the entire production honors the original story thank you it is so rare to accomplish what you have accomplished
Oct 22 2021,positive,absolutely incredible film the story is so well told fantastic looking film denis had hit it out of the park
Oct 22 2021,positive,dune is the star wars we have all been wanting and waiting for and they didnt even need lightsabers to make it as good as it is what a great movie
Oct 22 2021,negative,comparing this to david lynchs version  most of the same scenes but this stops when paul and his mother head out to meet the fremen  special effects are better but there is a lot of raceswapping and paul is scrawny  it is a pretty boring movie that i will probably never watch again
Oct 22 2021,positive,villeneuve obviously respected the difficult source material this is by far the best screen adaption of dune looking forward to the next one
Oct 22 2021,positive,it is the new generation of star war or got hope they make a follow up since they didnt finish the story
Oct 22 2021,positive,just amazing couldnt ask for a better adaptation to this scifi classic
Oct 22 2021,negative,wow terrible just terrible
Oct 22 2021,negative,the cast is stacked the world is great the story is so bad no action all dialogue that is useless to further the plot the sound is mediocre once again the story sucked zendaya has barely any screen time if you loved this movie you are a boring mom who reads books 247 with no creativity the dialogue was so annoying talk about the emperor 247 but dont even show him villains are there even any have no story there are literally no stakes i kept thinking what is on the line here nonsense your lying to yourself if you love this movie only good thing is the cast who play there bad character as well as possible so not interesting it felt like a damn documentary no story or action just unnecessary dialogue all the deaths i felt nothing honestly i felt happier once people died because then we could actually get focus on the main character for longer than a span of 5 mins its all over the place a mess honestly the next time i ever have trouble sleeping ill turn this on to put me right to sleep this makes batwoman look like the dark knight the trailer makes it look fun and entertaining but this is the most bleak bland and boring movie i have seen this year and possibly all time wonder womans slowno scenes from zsjl had faster pace than this entire movie
Oct 22 2021,negative,it could have been a great remake it wasnt it sucked visually it looked good some things can be changed for the better the changes in this movie sucked they should have stuck to the book and not tried to make it unique overall very boring and a feeble try this was a bigger disappointment than when the phantom menace came out
Oct 22 2021,negative,2 and a half hours of my life that i dont even want back if it means i have to watch that again i went in blind knowing none of the lore or backstory and quite honestly found that the storytelling was poorly done largely unexplained plot and i had no idea what direction they went with it visuals were okay but it was so slow paced that i wanted to turn off after an hour and a half a few short lived fighting scenes didnt make up for it if your reading this review i hope you dont waste your time
Oct 22 2021,negative,i found this to be unwatchable in parts slowest film ive seen in years tried to split one movie into 5 hours in two parts and you can tell the plot was unfollowable only positive i have is it was eye candy in some parts 25 hours i will never get back
Oct 22 2021,positive,i was stunned with the movie almost every scene is a work of art with the lighting costumes textures a really beautiful film an incredible audio experience as well they really considered the sound design also they were able to take a very complex book and make it digestible without feeling drawn out or boring the pacing kept everything moving but you didnt stumble through the complex plot details as a dune fan i couldnt ask for more and as a movie lover im stunned cant wait to see it again
Oct 21 2021,positive,it was a great movie loved the experience and i cannot wait for the next part to be released
Oct 21 2021,positive,the novel isnt anymore unadaptable
Oct 21 2021,positive,one of the best movies ive seen in a very long time a true triumph loved every minute
Oct 21 2021,positive,i cant put into words how i felt when i left the cinema i love scififantasy so for me this was beyond epic    its an intelligent grown up masterpiece of cinema quite frankly which deserves to be seen at an imax cannot wait for part 2
Oct 21 2021,positive,wow amazing world building on a huge scale fantastic acting throughout can not recommend highly enough
Oct 21 2021,negative,poor acting poor cast choices based on wokeness i had great hopes for this movie david lynchs 80s version is so much better 
Oct 21 2021,positive,as a cinematic experience it is nothing short of epic
Oct 21 2021,negative,too long and boring the plot is non sense timothee is hot
Oct 21 2021,positive,watching dune in imax blew me away having no prior knowledge of the story i was completely engaged throughout the movie the visuals and audio were meant to be experienced in a theatre hans zimmers score when paired with the scale of it all was chillinducing    what may turn viewers off is a lack of greater character depth and perhaps more screentime for some characters this should also be called dune part one as it only covers half of the first book for me however this movie is still an absolute must see
Oct 21 2021,positive,i loved the movie it was amazing to watch i wait for dune 2
Oct 21 2021,positive,epic accurate to the book which i did not need but it was nice i got chills many times long but im glad as i never wanted it to end it seemed to be about 12 of dune book 1 of the 6 books series the only negatives 1 they could have edited out a few wasteful scenes or moments 2 the music was a bit jarring at times not quite up to the near perfection of the old david lynch dunes sound track  i was worried they would wokenize the film but really all they did was replace a few white characters with black ones and none of that seemed out of place maybe a bit of forced environmentalism and anticolonialism but not so much that it spoiled the film
Oct 21 2021,positive,this movie was everything that i wanted people that doesnt like it lets pray for them
Oct 21 2021,positive,while the movie is certainly a visual masterpiece the empty characters are the major weakness of this movie in david lynchs dune pauls internal struggle and fears were due to his soliloquy more palpable now it all depends on timothees capacilities to act and he disappoints but worse of it all the harkonnen who  represented the ultimate evil quite convincingly in 1984 are now merely a bunch of bad guys  but nothing more if the saying that a movie is always as good as its villains was ever true this is no good news for this dune adaptaion still the movie entertains during the first 15 hours and only becomes a bit longwinded in the last hour still looking forward for the second part since  if ironing out some of these deficits  it could become the desired masterpiece of villeneuve
Oct 21 2021,positive,dune is everything i wanted it to be and more as a fan of the book it completely satisfies only negative is that the story ends unfinished lets just hope we get part two
Oct 21 2021,positive,visually stunning however it feels a lot of the best bits must have stayed on the cutting room floor one movie that would have benefitted from more violence and gore just felt a bit too nerfed and some of the casting was hit and miss
Oct 21 2021,positive,this adaptation really is a deeply immersive experience rarely seen on movies the visuals are almost part of the script as the movie goes the fast ending really left everyone wanting more a piece of art
Oct 21 2021,positive,visually this movie is nothing short of awe inspiring the promotion described this movie as a cross between lord of the rings and star wars and i couldnt agree more
Oct 21 2021,positive,a scifi epic with great effects cinematography worldbuilding and score characterizations can feel a bit flat however this is in most part due to the book reading more like scripture than a traditional novel part 2 will be grand and needs to be made
Oct 21 2021,positive,dune has long thought to be unadaptable then came the announcement that denis villeneuve would direct a new adaption as part of a two part film as the book was too big to fit into one movie which is true just look at david lynchs version originally supposed to release in december 2020 it was delayed to septemberoctober in 2021 and now we finally have it    the result a cinematic masterpiece i had very few doubts about this movie but i was a bit afraid that it wouldnt live up to my expectations being a huge fan of the books oh but it most certainly did it exceeded my expectations by a mile so much so that i watched it three times in the theater and i would certainly like to again  ive seen some people thinking the movie is boring but this isnt your run of the mill actionadventure flick and its not supposed to be its a faithful adaption of the highest selling scifi novel in paperback  there arent action scenes with quips around every corner however when there is action oh its beautiful duncan idaho carries these action sequences with excellent fight scenes that make you fall in love with his badassery    this is a more serious scifi epic that explores the politics of dune the culture of the fremen and prophecy of the bene gesserit the movie takes its time rightfully to invite you into a rich exciting world with great detail and lore we follow paul atreides through his journey from his home planet caladan into the desert of arrakis as he is thrust into this generation long prophecy alongside his bene gesserit mother the lady jessica who is a real badass and timothée chalamet is fantastic as paul some scenes have been left out from the book but thats to be expected and the cinematography visuals and score in this movie are off the charts this movie needs to be seen in a theater         since this is only part one the movie kind of does end abrubtly but this isnt really a bad thing when you know its only the first part the only problem is you want more and hopefully part two happens please warner bros greenlight part 2  rating 1010
Oct 21 2021,positive,everything about this movie was just magnificent excited for part 2
Oct 21 2021,negative,its boring  lots of landscape with contemplative music and no plot  it made me sleepy
Oct 21 2021,positive,awesome one of the best movies of the last decade
Oct 21 2021,positive,villeneuve definitely knows how to make a real film not an episode of a tv series like most contemporary mainstream films look like of course there are some flaws but the overall result is more than welcome

Oct 21 2021,positive,i want to start this by saying how much i love denis villeneuves work from sicario to arrival to prisoners to bladerunner 2049 hes probably one of my favourite modern directors and he has the keen ability to give an audience exactly what they want in 2049 he managed to take the bladerunner story and twist it on its head to keep it fresh and interesting without it feeling like a cash grab for nostalgias sake hes done the same here but in a differant way instead of making some loose mockery of herberts work to promote a musician denis has instead opted to recount the first half of the book almost scene for scene making very little major changes aside from a few casting choices still the casting was great oscar isaac is exactly how i imagined duke leto and paul was similarly well cast the cinematography was excellent and really contrasted well with the brilliant score and the arid backdrop of arrakis this film being part 1 really took its time in establishing the politics leading up to the films midpoint climax that being said there were a number of small minor cons id like to mention    in places the dialogue almost felt too quiet with actors struggling to speak over the admittedly brilliant score this didnt happen enough for it to take me out of the film but it was jarring in places    the casting for gurney and duncan was also strange despite the rest of the casting being great dont get me wrong jason momoa and josh brolin are great actors and play their parts well however i cant help but notice film gurney is way more morose with book gurney with barely an baliset in sight jason momoa was really just playing jason momoa which is fine but some of his dialogue felt too quippy and marvelesque for my tastes    still those are two really minor points in an otherwise amazing adaptation of a scifi classic i recommend both fans of the book and casual film fans to go out and watch this film preferably in imax because it was clearly filmed for imax im giving this film a solid 1010
Oct 21 2021,neutral,dune is a scifi epic but nonetheless not the best of his kind it is far better than lynchs version from 1984 but makes many faults too the movie tries to capture the books feeling so hard that the writers forgot how dramaturgy works the main battle which is the climax of this movie takes place in the middle of the movie but after that it doesnt speed up again yet slows down and ends in a moment of silence which doesnt make much sense to me also i would never compare this with the fellowship of the ring it is epic its effects are big but not as monumental as lotr plus i thought the score wasnt that great although it was a heart project by zimmer i might have found this film mediocre because its slower than the usual scifimovies or because of the focus on politics or because of villeneuves style which confused me in sicario as well in the end villeneuve made a decent yet mediocre work of scifi that picks up more and more weights that unfortunately pull this film down to a level that the scale of dune doesnt deserve
Oct 21 2021,positive,great movie great charscters only thing that is bad is that it ends and you need part 2
Oct 21 2021,negative,i dont know how you were able to sit through this movie fanboys of books and fans of the genre probably got high but in general  a game of thrones in the universe of star wars with its own rules which were not explained and conditionalities of which there are too many     imho the creators here sniffed the spice from the desert and went too far with the scale for the sake of history the movie looks very expensive but it doesnt help to get acquainted with the story at all    the neuroticasmaticprotagonist is shown too amorphously although it is clear that already in the second part he is a beast    the fights are well organized they were clearly emphasized but at least the creators could try to explain why the heroes cannot have pistols or assault rifles    got too many questions about universe and almost no answers    i root for hairless dudes even though they will lose    410
Oct 21 2021,negative,the film starts with the main character called something like harry potter and his mum has just caught him dreaming about girls again so being a bit weird she tells all his teachers    mrs mcgonagall turns up and orders harry to stick his hand in her magical box yes really she says he could be the one just in case it might then get mysterious or interesting they cleverly spell out all the story so if anyone watching feels like going to the toilet or going home or something they just can without missing anything at all  neat    harrys dad whos a top general in team america  hell yea gets posted to afghanistan and all the family go with for reason even though they all know its a trap you can figure out for out yourself its a trap if you listen really carefully because admiral ackbar says loudly its a trap and then so does every other character several times to protect the audience from being unpleasantly surprised or interested later on    they go to afghanistan and voldemort turns up  good lord its a trap they have several car chases but harry is best friends with vin diesels character from thefastandthefurious so they get away i missed a bit then as i remembered i had to upload pictures of my cat mr mittens to facebook but fortunately the second hour of the film was just a helicopter flying through a sand storm so there was plenty of time to fit in some hobbies like fermenting sauerkraut etc    there must be a plan for a sequel because they kept the plot for a later date the acting was really great which raises my overall rating of the film up to zero out of one hundred
Oct 21 2021,negative,one of the most boring movies of 2021 the art style was cool but story was boring and very predictable the audience is unable to connect to the characters resulting in a story that is uninteresting
Oct 21 2021,positive,an instant classic and is without a doubt the best adaptation of frank herberts masterpiece the original novel is one of my favorite pieces of fiction ever so the fact that i can call this new adaptation a masterpiece as well makes me happier than anything else now ill just have to patiently wait for part two of this great epic
