Apr 7 2024,positive, as increasing tensions with russia rise once again it seems fitting that oppenheimer sets forth the events that led to those initial tensions in aftermath of world war ii for too many the cold war still haunts their memories of fallout shelters and threats of nuclear annihilation and that fear stems from one event the creation of the atomic bomb brought in by the us government hoping to beat nazi germany to the punch of creating one they choose one of the foremost theoretical physicists in the world in spite of his wide travels of europe j robert oppenheimer cillian murphy is a brilliant scientist but his curiosity and desire to advance technology lead him on a collision course with history this film follows oppenheimer from his time as a young physics student to the head of the manhattan project as he works with some of the leading scientists in the world to put together a nuclear weapon to his posthiroshimanagasaki efforts to foster nuclear disarmament which earned him a secret investigation that brought down the man who orchestrated it atomic energy commission chair lewis strauss robert downey jr theres a lot of ground to cover in this 3hour biopic but director christopher nolan does a fantastic job of keeping things moving while skillfully explaining to the audience some of the more esoteric concepts on display writing your own screenplay like nolan has gives you an intimate knowledge of the subject matter but it also keeps you from seeing some of the flaws while its a lot of years to go over it still feels like it drags a bit through its middle hour still most of his more excessive tendencies the ones that marred films like interstellar are kept thankfully in check the slow realization that oppenheimer makes about the destructiveness of his efforts might sit poorly with audiences who expect him to come to understand its devastating capabilities sooner however as an early scene with him trying to poison his professor shows it isnt until after a lot of dwelling that he comes to that conclusion and attempts to rectify it at that point perhaps its too late especially against an administration desperate to label him as a malcontent and a foreign spy the films performances are all solid especially murphy in the lead role his shift from wideeyed optimist to cog in the political machine to antinuclear activist is convincing with the toll of years weighing heavily on his face nolan has always known how to use murphy well and he might well have given him the role of his career thats not to demean anyone else in the film downey jr josh hartnett and florence pugh all deliver strong performances emily blunt as oppenheimers wife has some great scenes but they build up almost out of nowhere her third act emergence as a key emotional force of anger in the film feels disingenuous its an underwritten role for an actor who deserves better that said there is an utter sour note in the film and its the cameo of gary oldman as president harry s truman his scenery chewing abomination is tackytruman was oft said to have defended the decision to save hundreds of thousands of lives by dropping the bomb but that decisionmaking process is given short shrift and the nuance of any such event is marred by the flippant dismissal of oppenheimer its a crass moment that wasnt needed at least not without more context even if rooted in strong anecdotal evidence  anyone leaving this film should take to heart oppenheimers quote recited twice in the film the first is as the optimist sharing conjugal relations with pughs character reciting from the hindu scripture the bhagavadgita now i am become death the destroyer of worlds it is an instructive quote for if his character did not fully understand its salience upon its first utterance his latefilm use of the phrase drives the point home effectively oppenheimer is a film about cycles and patterns such as what oppenheimer himself attempted to bring to theoretical physics and ultimately to applied physics his theories are scientific brilliance but the end result is incredibly tragic it exemplifies not just the difficulty of advancing technology without harming others but also the challenge of coming to terms with whats created afterwards it takes a noble mind to recognize ones culpability in that and this film enables the viewer to recognize that and honor oppenheimers legacy however challenging it might be

Mar 8 2024,positive, there are moments that change everything the detonation of the first atomic bomb on hiroshima is arguably one of those moments the birth of a weapon of untold destructive power for the first time mankind had the potential to destroy the world in a matter of hours if not minutes oppenheimer 2023 tells the story of the creation the bomb and the man who spearheaded the project cillian murphy plays robert j oppenheimer the theoretical physicist who put together the team and masterminded the architecture of the manhattan project thin and weary looking with an impassive expression and bright blue eyes that are a well of determination and worry murphy incarnates oppenheimer as a man driven as a jewishamerican he feels a duty to stop hitler and the third reich at all costs and he fears that nazi scientists are already ahead of the rest of the world in their project to harness atomic energy but there is also the pioneer spirit of a scientist conquering the next frontier putting the theoretical into practice in an unprecedented way nolan gives us the sweep of his complicated lifethe film spans decades and features scores of charactersas it delves into the history the politics and the morality around it he wrote the screenplay based on the biography by kai bird and martin sherwin and hews to the historical record and there is a lot going on a marriage emily blunt plays his often frustrated wife and family dragged around and often neglect in his odyssey friendships tested by his zealousness the tugofwar between politics military expediency and scientific possibility and true to form nolan jumps around key periods helping us keep the eras straight with different styles its challenging to be sure but not daunting for a film so enmeshed in ideas and loaded with meeting and conversations and debates scientific and moral it is as visually compelling as it is narratively nolan is a filmmaker who has commanded huge budgets and production resources he made oppenheimer on a relatively smaller budget at least compared to previous production and creates an epic of sorts that never shows signs of compromise and for that first test detonation in the desert he displays the power and fury of the atomic explosion without recourse to digital effects its a remarkable way to evoke the power of splitting atoms unleashing the fury of the gods matt damon is general leslie groves who gambles on oppenheimer and backs him against the governments wariness of his past politics and robert downey jr the chair of the atomic energy commission a wily political player whose resentment of oppenheimer drives efforts to discredit the scientist once the war is over they are the most consequential supporting players in a massive cast and its to nolans credit that even the smaller supporting roles carve out their own place in the story kenneth branagh as dutch physicist niels bohr florence pugh as jean tatlock who had a long affair with oppenheimer tom conti as albert einstein theres also david krumholtz alden ehrenreich jason clarke tony goldwyn benny safdie and casey affleck just to scratch the surface it won seven academy awards including best picture director actor for cillian murphy and supporting actor for robert downey jr and nolan won best director awards from the directors guild and the new york film critics circle perhaps just as importantly it was half of the barbenheimer phenomenon that helped bring crowds back to the movies in the long tail of covid dont miss a single recommendation subscribe to the stream on demand weekly newsletter your email address will not be shared and follow us on facebook and x formerly known as twitter the bluray and twodisc dvd special edition includes the 70minute documentary the story of our time the making of oppenheimer the nbc news documentary to end all war oppenheimer  the atomic bomb the trinity anniversary panel discussion qa with director nolan oppenheimer biographer kal bird and others and other supplements sean axmaker is a seattle film critic and writer he writes the weekly newspaper column stream on demand and the companion website and his work appears at rogerebertcom turner classic movies online the film noir foundation and parallax view
Mar 8 2024,positive, writers lives as depicted in french films continue to be things of great mystery and i dont mean murder mystery in justine triets anatomy of a fall a married middleaged writer couple sandra hüller and samuel theis seems overly involved in rap fandom their dog is named snoop and husband samuel often according to wife sandra plays an instrumental steeldrum version of 50 cents pimp at full volume while doing home repairs on their massive aframe in the french alps the day he falls out a window and diesaccidentally a suicide murdered by sandra who knowshes blaring it on a loop the film will go on to pester us with this track five times during various flashbacks and trial scenes it comes across as a weird joke or a prank triet is playing that has some meaning for her but not for us its not mischievous like the repetition of california dreamin in chungking express because anatomy of a fall is otherwise pofaced by the end any sympathy we might have had for samuel evaporates with these pimp needle drops they make him into a ridiculous man and after 152 minutes its a great relief not that sandra has been exonerated of his murder but that we wont have to hear those steel drums again triets previous film sibyl 2019 was agile witty and original this one is prosaic as if an article from the cut about the domestic lives of writers has been crossed with an episode of law  order if only an expert like icet had shown up in the courtroom scenes to push stop on pimp and explain things to the judge somebody try to bust my eardrums im gonna bust their ass the writer couple greta lee and john magaro in celine songs debut feature past lives are younger less established and blander than the one in anatomy of a fall residents of a notgreat apartment in the lower east side they dont have much in the way of personality nora is korean and a playwright arthur a whiteguy novelist who has written a novel called boner if nora can be said to have a characteristic it is her desire to win literary prizes she has left her successful arty parents behind in south korea because koreans dont win the nobel prize for literature she also dreams of winning a pulitzer and a tony this seemed dated and contrived since koreans do win oscars pretending nora is not a screenwriterdirector like her creator or might become one is a deflection after parasites success in 2020 the film is more literature than cinema elevated mumblecore for graduate writing seminars the opposite of for instance hong sangsoo who makes lowbudget films about writers and filmmakers without worrying about prizes and whose films dont seem written at all with its expensivelooking cinematography slowdivesounding score and fancy editing past lives is designed to win awards which it has like nora celine song made a conscious choice to leave one life behind and start another her film is the result of a series of other professional choices too and it shows it is hard to understand the decisions that went into cord jeffersons adaptation of percival everetts unique and startling novel erasure but with the exception of the cast they were decisions that dont work american fiction is watereddown unexciting and nonabrasive its unclever title is an example of the films basic strategy which is to take material that might offend people material that was in fact designed to offend people and update it for a world that demands to not be offended though its topped with an inconclusive series of postmodern codas this is a family comedy with hallmark touches when the main character thelonious monk ellison jeffrey wright a beleaguered black novelist announces early in the movie that he doesnt believe in race i didnt think that meant he wanted to be in my big fat greek wedding the twin worlds of publishing and hollywood are mocked here without ever looking or feeling anything like those worlds do in real life the ersatz quality of it all extends to the music on the soundtrack why hire the great patrice rushen to play gentle jazz piano over everything in a score she didnt write herself an earlier metascene in which we see keith david and okieriete onaodowan as a stereotypical drunk father and gangbanger son acting out scenes in ellisons deliberately bad novel and arguing with him about how corny and exploitative they are is a good idea but its truncated maybe because it hits too close to what jefferson is doing himself the direct criticism of other movies in that scene and in other parts of american fiction is dubious too are we supposed to think boyz n the hood is a bad movie now its a thousand times better than this one jeffrey wright seems held back in american fiction the same cannot be said of paul giamatti who plays a lonely bitter classics teacher at a new england prep school in alexander paynes the holdovers fitted with one walleye contact lens giamatti stares at the corner of the room while fixing whats left of his gaze on his students whom he considers recalcitrant philistines entitled little degenerates giamattis performance is a pleasure to watch he is the presiding presence in the movie and david hemingsons erudite screenplay allows him free range to deliver long lines of invective at the same time giamatti is part of a three stooges act with davine joy randolph as the taciturn manager of the schools cafeteria and dominic sessa the one student left behind at the school over christmas if this trio seems to shut out the rest of the world and to reduce the other characters in the film to walkons its because they are also doing that in their own lives each trapped alone in various stages of grief the holdovers is destined to be a christmas classic precisely because it is not a feelgood movie randolphs son is a casualty of an unjust war sessas father is a hopeless mental case with the official cuckoos nest haircut of institutionalized madness and giamatti is denied a happy ending as he drives away from the school with a bottle of pilfered brandy pressed to his lips the movie isnt feelgood set in 1970 it is nostalgic payne and cinematographer eigil bryld have given the holdovers a warm oldschool shoton film look that the viewer can slip into like a coma leonie benesch gives a sensitive lively performance in the teachers lounge as carla a young seventh grade teacher in hamburg with her two big functional eyes and her positive attitude shes the opposite of giamatti in the holdovers she shows love for her students and a great desire to help them which she expresses with dancelike physicality in the gym classes she teaches along with her main job teaching math an arrangement that would be comic in an american film but in a german one is graceful and nurturing shes too good to be true so of course director ilker çatak is setting her up for a fall a series of thefts at the school implicates minority students in the eyes of the other teachers but carla suspects one of her colleagues thereby initiating a series of events that will embroil this place of learning in recriminations ill will and chaos but its a lite lowstakes kind of chaos the lesson here is that no good deed goes unpunished the film is a mild version of a haneke movie seemingly made for the middleschoolers who populate it and who are presumably not yet ready for a fullstrength piano teachers lounge barbie like no movie before it pushed the limit of what constitutes legitimate news versus whats free publicity for a pseudoevent designed to rake in money for a large corporation obviously barbie came out ahead making 15 billion worldwide though even with that haul barbies parent company warner bros discovery somehow lost 31 billion in 2023 if their board of directors was on the ball margot robbie and greta gerwig would be running the studio not david zaslav the push for barbie was intense its only analogue was the rightwing medias obsession with hunter biden the maga barbie cnncom which is also owned by warner bros discovery published 128 separate news stories about the film the new york times published 84 pieces on barbie and mentioned barbie in nonbarbierelated pieces over 450 times richard brody of the new yorker became barbies number one fan among film critics tweeting about barbie or its principals some three dozen times including one tweet in french and another that stated that barbie was a better movie than 2001 a space odyssey except for the unrivalled stargate sequence brody had mentioned barbie as early as february 2020 more than three years before the film came out in a review of the robbiesuperherostarrer birds of prey in which he told readers he was greatly looking forward to her performance in the title role of barbie the next film by greta gerwig who i suspect will have an altogether more original view of robbies art that is what you call advance praise one cnncom piece on how enraging it was to the author that robbie and gerwig were not nominated for a best actress and best director oscars stated that the only people who didnt love barbie were reactionary rightwing dorks when hillary clinton weighed in with a punny tweet to console robbie and gerwig about the snub it became clear that barbie was a form of official art an item of capitalist realism about which only one set of values should be expressed in public it was supposed to matter that those values were feminist and not just consumerist this view and its proponents became clearer for me recently when a cinephile friend told me about how last july she had excused herself from a bachelorette party that included going to see barbie she thought she had dodged the pink bullet but one day in january while she was out she got a couple of texts from her buildings unofficial super a man in his sixties have you seen barbie the first text asked if not you should its quite clever and funny said the second i left it on your stair just in case when she got home and entered her building there it was a bluray of barbie borrowed from the local library sitting on the steps to her door yorgos lanthimos is our leading auteur of halfbaked ideas but since hes begun working with screenwriter tony mcnamara on movies starring emma stone things have started to gel and get moist poor things a film of sugar and violence is a bizarro barbie a forceful entertaining movie without smugness featuring a kind of outré production design all its own every effect is thrown in the film is in color and blackandwhite it pushes the use of wideangle cinematography in new directions hybrid animals wander about and mad scientist willem dafoe belches floating orblike bubblesall this before the film gets to emma stones bella a victorian wild child chasing mysteries of the organism through an ocean liners casino and a parisian brothel dafoe is a disfigured frankenstein and stone his messy demanding monster a creation that escapes his lab moves on and quickly takes over the action once she discovers the pleasures of sex furious jumping with mark ruffalos louche playboy she leaves england for lisbon a world of fine dining and ballroom dancing where she gets to declare immortally i must go punch that baby it was reported that poor things looks like a tim burton movie it doesntits more like an animated karel zeman movie come to lifethough it does synthesize almost every frankenstein movie that came before it instead its a film with a true sadean quality made for libertines not puritans who will find many opportunities in it to be offended its about time something so wicked was made at such a high level im troubled by writers who never ask themselves what if i didnt do this some things should be passed over in silence i felt that way last fall when taylor swift the eras tour came out in theaters when i noticed aging male film critics rushing to see this nearly threehour concert film so they could write about it i was embarrassed for them another kind of movie is also like that to me musicals based on movies that were not musicals but which became stage musicals then movies again i saw the musical version of the producers when it came out in 2005 and it struck me as inert laughless and botched since then i have avoided musical versions of hairspray and mean girls and probably some others ive forgotten existed the new color purple movie musical is one of these it starts well with a pretitle song called huckleberry pie performed with delighted charm by phylicia pearl mpasi and halle bailey as sisters accompanied by colman domingo as a bluesman cowboy playing banjo on a horse set along the georgia coast amid trees draped in spanish moss this number appeared to pay homage to daughters of the dust and was directed by blitz bazawule in a very uptotheminute cgi style that showed a certain flair like maybe the movie was going to use its artifice to some new advantage other of these musicals had not as an introductory interlude that evoked life in a rural black community in 1909 it promised something that was not just hokum but then the rest of the film was just hokum and there was a lot of it with plenty of beatings especially for poor celie fantasia barrino at the hands of mister domingo who gets his comeuppance and is forgiven and as an act of contrition decides to wear shimmery fancy pants to the big group hug at the end he looked clownish but as punishments go he got off easy the brute fact of killers of the flower moons threeandahalfhour existence is something to be reckoned with but it also emphasizes how its story is hard to endure scorseses film is truly novelistic like a dreiser novelwhich is to say it also has the detail of a silent stroheim film from the time in which most of it takes place the late 1910s and 1920s offering meticulous period set decoration props and wardrobe down to the boots and driving goggles once again as he has been doing at least since goodfellas in 1990 and up through the more recent silence and the irishman scorsese presents a mentor relationship in which an older man takes a younger one under his wing so that he can exploit him by making him do his dirty work here this is pushed to its extreme as it involves the murder of a racethe osage on their reservation in oklahomaand the expropriation of their oilrich land dicaprio and de niro have lost almost all expressiveness at this point in this kind of story both of them frownyface masks riveted in place with all the other white people bastards with their hands out looking like variations on the pep boys scorsese compares them to wolves the same way the chinese communists in kundun were visually equated with vultures pecking at the bones of the dead the osage are lost here literally vanishing americans a racist concept hammered home by de niros villain in the films criminal scheme the performances of the native actors are swamped by the white country and americana musicians scorsese has cast in small roles as various murderers thieves and creeps william belleau by contrast is tragic and difficult to watch as the hapless henry roan the melancholic suicidal alcoholic osage who is befriended and discarded shot in the head and left in the road for the first time in a scorsese film however a woman is at the center of the mens relationship lily gladstones mollie a wealthy diabetic shes got too much sugar and unmarried osage comes between dicaprios ernest and de niros hale after hale subtly sets it up for ernest to marry her gladstones performance is unlike anything else in scorseses work shes calm and smart but taken in by ernest even though she knows hes a kind of wolf toocoyote wants money in the second half of the film gladstone must portray her as the martyr of the films sickening deglamorized violence she lingers between life and death unaware shes being poisoned by her husband as she grieves for her mother and sisters dying one by one ernest starts the film as a taxi driver reminding us of scorsese the modernist auteur of the 1970s who here reasserts himself outside of this naturalistic movie in its coda where the lie of entertainment mirrors the contemporary scenes of the cleaners in the zone of interest in europe there are museums for these horrors their history expressed in piles of shoes and eyeglasses in america its called showbiz yeah well fuck that im gonna swim from cuba to florida is probably the least relatable statement ive ever heard in a movie annette bening in the title role as diana nyad however convinces us that its worth doing no matter how many times she has to try as dianas exlover best friend and coach jodie foster says when she starts hallucinating you go with it nyad is a tribute to dianas selfcentered delusion which the film eventually locates in her fathers obsession with her destiny as a swimmer because hed changed their last name to the goddesslike but fishy nyad and in the years of sexual abuse she suffered at the hands of a coach while she was a teenage olympic swimmer in training in the ocean she mentally escapes her past using boomer pop hits like the sound of silence to measure her pace during these selfimposed saltwater marathons the film should come alive to these songs but it never quite does a scene of a near shark attack is immediately followed by diana just getting on with it to the tune of neil youngs heart of goldshe is crossing the ocean for one you see nyad was directed by the sports doc couple who made free solo and follows its story closely and faithfully never rising much above sea level its one hallucinatory underwater scene looks too much like its set at a fishbowl castle i couldnt tell if that was intentional or not bradley coopers ambitious leonard bernstein biopic starts out lively presenting the world of midcentury classical music and life in the carnegie hall apartments as a fastpaced samesex romp with aaron copland shouting advice from offscreen its in blackandwhite too the same way the similar 1950s milieu of new york theater is presented in asteroid city soon though its in color and bisexual lenny gets bogged down by a wife carey mulligan and a country house with a swimming pool where during the parties they throw they also throw around adjectives like bigass and random and phrases like misread the room which im certain no one was using in the dakota or in connecticut in the 1970s mulligans felicia has to put up with a lot in bernstein she knows what hes like and what he needs to be happy and to do his work and she gives up her career as an actress for him and their children ignoring his male lovers as best she can while sliding inexorably into the lonely role of longsuffering wife bernstein exists parallel to her and coopers performance is daring and convincing but something doesnt add up since the film skips the 1960s by the time we get to felicias cancer lenny and she have aged and now look like evel knievel and nancy reagan miscast in an unhappy marriage a changeinmood time leap commandeered from boogie nights and now standard in biopics that include cocaine gone are the late 1950s and all of the 1960s when bernstein went radical chic and was doing tv shows with miles davis and donating money to the black panthers at cocktail parties in his huge apartment with otto preminger and richard avedon by his side thats a loss if you have a chance to have somebody play preminger in a movie take it robert oppenheimer cillian murphy is closetednot closeted too but his nonsecret is leftwing politics and his parties are with the cpusa around sexy fellow travelers he cant help mentioning hes read all three volumes of capital in german making sure to add that marx bored him this tension also splits oppenheimer into blackandwhite and color the color sections of nolans film concentrate on quantum physics and show the development of the atomic bomb at los alamos the frenzy of the trinity test and its aftermath the blackandwhite parts follow the confirmation hearings of lewis strauss robert downey jr a former chair of the atomic energy commission and oppenheimers stealth nemesis who is up for a seat in eisenhowers cabinet politics is for gray men science is chromatic murphy inhabits oppenheimer so completely that at times he disappears into the background of his own biopic making it easy to understand why his wife kitty emily blunt continually implores him to fight politicos redbaiting him downey freed from his iron suit and the mcu is plunged into a hidden universe of waves and particles where oppenheimer casually dismisses him because he knows strauss is in over his head he doesnt realize hes paranoid too downeys performance is one of subtlety and guile right up to the last twist i have never seen an actor so thoroughly redeemed by taking a hard thankless role like this the film is cast like a preminger movie specifically like advise  consent which it resembles in key ways the backroom politics and endless meetings with the branches of the federal government and the panoply of stars in minor roles advise  consent had burgess meredith and betty white this has benny safdie and casey affleck nolan often cuts their dialog within an inch of its life making his scenes less dynamic so that their words can emphasize how high the stakes are ending world war ii nuclear holocaust he does make room for the romance of radiation within the drama of security clearance when oppenheimer meets kitty weve already seen the firework bursts of color that play in his head when hes contemplating the motion of atoms in space so there is an erotic charge when he explains physics to kitty at a nighttime commie shindig in pasadena he looks almost into her eyes touches hands with her and describes the subatomic action in this glass this drink this countertop our bodies later hes part of a government group enumerating potential deaths when the abomb is dropped on hiroshima a corporate meeting that echoes similar conclaves in the zone of interest these scenes of groups of men tallying mortality are an obscene cloud hovering over 2023 movies the political activist bayard rustin a contemporary of oppenheimer and leonard bernstein who organized the march on washington in 1963 was both gay and an excommunist so the struggles in his biopic are not going to be easy ones colman domingos portrayal of him in george c wolfes rustin is warm and involving and this is a somber drama about a consequential time in our nations history yet the films perfunctory elements are enlivened by kitsch rustin mixing cocktails in his bachelor pad and playing the lute for his boyfriend was more than i expected the film like oppenheimer offers a whoswho of its specific milieu the civil rights movement and its leaders its odd that jeffrey wright is so much stronger in rustin than he is in american fiction here he plays adam clayton powell jr as a selfimportant raconteur with a cigarette holder a man who doesnt know hes past his prime as a macher in national politics and race relations the british guy who plays martin luther king jr aml ameen on the other hand cant stand up to domingo at all or even to chris rocks roy wilkins im convinced that hiring brits to play mlk is a continuing conspiracy to undermine his message somehow the fbi has taken control of the casting the branford marsalis jazz score in rustin is as tasteful as expected the film less so rustin yelling cheese spoils you shouldve known better at the movies moment of truth came out of nowhere like one of those loud low blats lester young used to drop into solos wes anderson released five movies in 2023 four of them are his roald dahl adaptations shorts the longest of which is the wonderful world of henry sugar at thirtynine minutes the otherspoison the swan and the rat catcherrun seventeen minutes each his feature film asteroid city is a fleet 105 minutes with no waste thats 195 minutes of cinema about the same length as killers of the flower moon or oppenheimer bifurcated between blackandwhite and color sequences asteroid city has a lot in common with oppenheimer and maestro its plot is clear enough though it seemed to confuse some people who somehow also found it thin the film in color is a 1950s teleplay the writing and production of which we see in blackandwhite in the play a group of scientific whiz kids and their parents have gathered for an astronomy convention in a tiny town in the southwest thats located near a nuclear test site the kids are to be presented by a government agency with achievement awards for their various inventions during the ceremony an alien visits to retrieve an asteroid that fell thousands of years ago meanwhile two of the parentsone a famous movie actress scarlett johansson the other a roving photojournalist jason schwartzman both actors in the playbriefly fall in love before going their separate ways because of the sets which were built on location the film has an abstract quality it draws on a rich history of midcentury drama and science moves swiftly nothing lingered on it isnt a biopic and it makes no concessions to emotionality in asteroid city and these dahl shorts through elaborate but simple onscreen stagecraft anderson presents an everchanging world of plastic beauty that he creates from the ground up the screenplays are hyperliterate in an unprecedented total avoidance of cheese in commercial narrative filmmaking the act of writing and the writers doing it appear in these movies but anderson refrains from showing their writing on the screen in superimposition just by being cinema andersons work now seems to some viewers avantgarde and difficult yet also something obvious they can parody on social mediaanother sign of the regression of the movies into content in asteroid city rupert friend has a minor role as a singing cowboy in the teleplay whos later revealed to be a british actor as of course is friend thats another unprecedented thing to reveal the brit under the cowboy friend narrates and stars in the swan in full british mode as an adult version of the boy in the story who is set upon my two unseen guntoting bullies whom he also brings to life just through they way he delivers their dialogue friends also in the rat catcher as an auto mechanic with a shop next to a newspaper office there was something so marvelous in seeing this actor in four roles each of which he nailed in these excellent films that did not get the recognition they deserved j a bayonas society of the snow is this years all quiet on the western front a mishandled european remake of an american film based on a grueling historical event and a bestselling book bayona has become a worse director since he made the impossible in 2012 also a disaster movie but much more cinematic and enjoyable in the way it seemed to punish a tourist family for going on vacation in thailand right before a tsunami as cgi has become dominant bayonas work has suffered along with the cinema in general because of that we have to suffer too the one fact everyone knows about the alive disaster is that the uruguayan rugby players who were trapped in the snow in the andes after their plane crashed had to resort to cannibalism to survive netflix is touting society of the snow as a muchneeded celebration of the human spirit and downplaying the cannibalism which is now known as survival anthropophagy which doesnt sound much nicer and is still the movies selling point it is inhuman to deny that bayona ends the movie imitating terrence malick because the boys had a religious experience which is what having very little to eat in freezing temperatures for seventytwo straight days will do to you i have known about the alive disaster almost my whole life one summer afternoon when i was about 7 on a rainy day when i had to stay in i was sitting in the living room with my grandmother in alton bay new hampshire watching an afternoon talk show on tv the survivors of the crash were the guests i had never heard of cannibalism it was a completely new concept to me and at first i couldnt understand what these young men meant as they were discussing their plight with the host when i began to get what had happened i was horrified i couldnt believe it these guys had eaten human flesh i turned to my grandmother and quietly asked her grammy if we were in a plane crash together and i died would you eat my skin she answered without taking her eyes off the tv screen sometimes in very bad situations she said we have to do things we wouldnt do under other circumstances ending our conversation right there natalie portman plays an actress in todd hayness may december an alarming film with a poisonous view of drama an equally brilliant companion piece to hayness safe from 1995 which also starred julianne moore may december identifies and measures the new surfaces of banality that have emerged in our lives in the intervening twentyeight years moore is gracie a suburban housewife in georgia in her fifties twentythree years previously shed had an affair with a 13yearold seventh grader joe charles melton got arrested for it became a tabloid media sensation gave birth to joes son in prison then married him when she got out the story is in some ways similar to gus van sants to die for which came out the same year as safe and which was rooted in the pamela smart case the way may december comes out of the mary kay letourneau story the present in may december is a goodygoody era in which sex crime and psychological complication have been swept under the rug portman arrives in gracie and joes life in the form of legitimate fameshes the star of a hit networktv series called norahs ark who will play grace in an indie moviebut shes also a duplicitous force who will rob them of their story and plunder gracies odd persona odder than in the bergman film along with her slight lisp the best acted film of the year it compares people to all sorts of animals including snakes and coyotes as in killers of the flower moon settling on butterflies and golden retrievers these are associated with joe a niceguy father of three now in his thirties but stunted and kept babyish by gracie who makes him the provider and caretaker of her frilly conventional life in showing portmans elizabeth concentrating on the work haynes slowly reveals her as a selfcentered hollywood monster starting to understand that shes in the presence of a bigger monster the film associates moores gracie with pineapple upsidedown cakes the way poor things associated emma stones bella with portuguese custard tartspastries of excess and derangement in my late teens i was obsessed with wim wenders and i was fortunate because i got to see almost all the features and shorts he made between 1968 and 1982 before i saw paris texas and wings of desire and began to doubt him there were a lot of wenders film series and revivals going on then it seemed like the american friend was always playing somewhere and for a brief time in the early 1980s wenders was revered by young cinephiles more than godard in retrospect it is easy to see why a cinephile director himself dedicated to nicholas ray wenders made films of ennui and longing set in desolate landscapes in germany and america that showed us what we saw through the windshields of our cars his movies went directly to the heart of the kind of men who are in them romantic postpunk loners who cant express their feelings verbally and like the kinks in american films i mean and in reality these japanese families are so strong to me even though i have nothing to do with them i have nothing to do with the way they eat or with the way they sleep or with the way they get drunk all the time it has nothing to do with me and i feel so close to them that if i had to choose id rather sleep on the floor and sit my whole life on the floor and get drunk every day and live in an ozu family than pass a single day as the son of henry fonda by obliquely referring to peter fonda wenders is slagging easy rider and the new hollywood generation who loved john ford movies as much as he did and offering a differentiator he knows about something they dont and he is willing to be abject about it all this seemed odd coming from a man who often dressed like he was auditioning for the lynch mob in johnny guitar and it confused me though it got me to watch ozu films i owe wenders that i have a feeling wenders has not slept on the floor very much since that interview almost fifty years ago i saw some photographs of wenders from the perfect days shoot in which he is dressed in the same tokyo toilet cleaning uniform hirayama kôji yakusho wears in the movie hes still abjecting himself now hes made a movie about it the meek hirayama lives in a tiny apartment sleeps on the floor and listens to classicrock cassette tapes in his van which is outfitted for toilet cleaning the way the van in kings of the road was outfitted for fixing 35mm movie projectors if it is raining out hirayama listens to a song that mentions rain hey where did we godays when the rains came if the sun is coming up he listens to a sunrise song there is a house in new orleansthey call it the rising sun this is too onthenose but like i said simple here wenders gives us a kind of pleasant neorealism about a man who has withdrawn from life but who literally has his shit together i thought the film was going somewhere deep into tragic territory but no it turns out the quiet hirayama has a rich father hirayama lives the way he lives because he has rejected his familys valueshes proving hes not henry fondas son a rock song thats not in the movie explains it he wants to live like common people refugees from africa who brave the mediterranean to get to europe are not doing it for personal glory like diana nyad matteo garrones io capitano however suggests that in some cases they are seydou and moussa seydou starr and moustapha fall are 16yearold cousins in dakar who spend their free time making up songs to perform for their neighborhood pals though they are fatherless and dominated by their mothers and sisters their lives are full with school and parttime jobs in construction still they dream of going to italy to be music stars white people will be asking you for autographs moussa tells seydou as in garrones remarkable incisive movie reality about a man desperate to get on an unscripted television show grande fratello in his home country seydou and moussa have to learn the hard way an electronics repairman in the market oumar diaw tells them europe is cold and crimeridden filled with homeless people you think europe is better than africa he asks them what you see on tv is not real they leave anyway crossing the sahara to get to tripoli and a boat to naples right away they are plunged into a precarious dangerous world of human trafficking violent militias starvation torture and slave labor their journey presented by garrone as mythic lyrical and terrifying ends with seydou forced by libyan gangsters to pilot the boat across the sea responsible for the lives of the other refugees onboard seydou rises to the occasion because when youre 16 you can do anything paolo carneras virtuosic unhackneyed cinematography is the costar here io capitano is an exquisitely shot film with the warm colors of senegal competing against the shifting tones of the desert and the rust of the boat at sea im not sure if this is the most accurate version of the situation its presenting but it has got to be the most beautiful more a report on the human condition than on the banality of evil jonathan glazers film of nazi life next door to auschwitz is also a christmas card from a family of blonds in matching sweaters telling you what theyve been doing all year seen as an exploitation film by people who have never seen an exploitation film the zone of interest presents a series of distanced precise tableaux with father christian friedel going over the architectural plans of a crematorium at home in his stocking feet while mother sandra hüller tries on a fur coat upstairs and finds a used lipstick in its pocket or tests desserts with the household staff do flowers scream the offscreen space of sound in the zone of interest is paralleled to the scale of invisibility of the death camp which we never see but hear in the background as hedwig hüller prepares for a garden party or goes about other activities in her familys domestic life here is a singleincome family with a father the head of production at the factory next door the insistent harrowing chill the film produces is not relieved by the fairytale scenes of a girl hiding food around the perimeter of the camp so that the condemned jewish prisoners will have something to eat while they work themselves to death glazer shoots those scenes in some combination of camera negative and infrared photography in one we hear the tale of hansel and gretel read over the image the part about the witch being stuffed into the oven the story turns into one we know daddy is promoted and the family will have to move out of their dream house spoiling their happy life this is the same plot as vincente minnellis judy garland musical meet me in st louis filmed in hollywood and released in american theaters during the exact same time frame in which the zone of interest takes place1943 and 1944 in minnellis film which takes place in 1903 and 1904 the father leon ames announces that hes taking a job in new york city and the family will have to leave their idyllic life in st louis things work out and they dont have to which is also where the zone of interest ends before its shock cut to cleaning women wiping the glass displays in the presentday auschwitzbirkenau state museum realizing this films inadvertent connection to a nostalgic mgm musical as i watched the the zone of interest placed it in new even more dire perspective glazers film is a punk provocation like the sex pistols song holidays in the sun with johnny rotten singing about the new belsen and a cheap holiday in other peoples misery as he anticipates world war iii if this film is a work of banality banal compared to what n1 is a print and digital magazine of literature culture and politics

Mar 5 2024,positive, lets be honest 2023 was not the best year for hollywood which dealt with its first dual actorswriters strike since 1960with a string of megabudget blockbusters flopping independent and international cinema flourished for me 2023 will be remembered as the year of shah rukh khan where the baadshah of bollywood came back to the screen four times  and reclaimed his throne as the king he has been since starring in 1993s dilwale dulhania le jayenge that alone made going to the movies worth it a few movies didnt quite make the top ten including magic mikes last dance barbie extraction 2 the zone of interest pathaan all of us strangers american fiction poor things the hunger games the ballad of songbirds  snakes and guardians of the galaxy vol 3 but should be lauded for their attempt to break against the mold and deliver some of the most singular moviegoing experiences of 2023  ari asters third feature film is a total hoot even if it might not be everyones cup of tea with a careerbest performance from joaquin phoenix who descends into total and often nightmarish amounts of madness for 179 minutes aster continuously assaults your patience into something that never once materializes into anything tangible but is so riotously entertaining and absurd that you cant help but love it just know this if i ever were to make a feature film and given carte blanche from a studio i would do something like beau is afraid take that as you will  with all of this oscar talk i am surprised no one is talking about daniel goldhabers how to blow up a pipeline one of the most important movies of 2023 goldhabers environmentalist thriller couldnt have arrived at a better time in a year that will be remembered as the hottest on record until the summer of 2024 oil lobbying groups even attempted to campaign against it when the consensus is clear fossil fueldriven burning is the cause of our environmental woes goldhaber thrillingly paints this message with the manic energy of a safdie brothers film through its handheld camera and incessant shouting from its leads punctuated by gavin briviks distressing daniel lopatinesque score unfortunately its a highly essential movie that isnt being talked about enough heres hoping it gets brought back into the conversation soon  in just 91 minutes emma seligman and rachel sennott keep the laughs coming in breakneck fashion with each massive setpiece as gutbustingly hilarious as the last sennott and ayo edebiri have incredible chemistry making their script feel alive and highly energetic it was the bigscreen comedy event of the year and im glad to have seen it that way with a massively packed crowd  christopher nolans latest is also his bestever film fully at the height of his largeformat artistic powers he crafts a towering and monumental achievement that is highly difficult to watch but continuously thrilling through its careerbest performances from cillian murphy and robert downey jr i may never watch oppenheimer ever again but im glad i witnessed nolans biggest triumph on an imax screen as one of the most important cinematic documents of our time  no im not talking about the adam sandler lizard movie although it was highly entertaining and better than most animated offerings released in 2023 im talking about lokesh kanagarajs vijaystarred character study on how a persons penchant for violence can never be extinguished if they are born and raised out of violence parthiban says he is an ordinary person who wants to live an ordinary life but the threat of antony das sanjay dutt leads him back into his old bloody sweet past whats most striking about kanagarajs pictures is how he elevates his action from scene to scene and visually represents parthibans psychological shift look at how his camera movements evolve within 164 minutes and itll tell you everything you need to know about his visualfirst approach and why hes one of the best tamil filmmakers working today  chad stahelskis opera of violence is one of the most artistically stirring movies of 2023 yet there isnt a single awards body even nominating it for its craft dan laustsen arguably delivers the best cinematography of any movie released in 2023 giving john wick chapter 4 the visual palette it needs to set it apart from literally any action movie ever released i remain convinced its one of the greatest american action films ever made which will hopefully change hollywoods approach to action and pave the way for stuntwork to finally be recognized as the craft it is  justine triets latest collaboration with sandra hüller saw her win the palme dor at the cannes film festival and its the decades most deserving win patiently revealing the drama triet brilliantly shoots the film in a véritélike fashion giving an authentic look and feel to a lead character who we arent sure to trust at the end of the film we will all have different interpretations of what weve seen and whether or not sandra is guilty but thats the beauty of ambiguity its a far better and more intelligent way of making art than spoonfeeding the audience preventing them from thinking triet makes us all reflect  since her feature directorial debut in a brothers love monia chokri has singlehandedly saved québec cinemas reputation internationally denis villeneuve is currently working in the hollywood ecosystem mind you with movies that are not only terrifically written but are masterclasses in visual storytelling collaborating for the first time with cinematographer andré turpin the two create a rich visual language inspired by some of the greatest filmmakers for a traditionally paced but emotionally enveloping love story with two impassioned performances from magalie lépineblondeau and pierreyves cardinal its the best piece of québec cinema ive seen this year and sets monia chokri apart as one of the few singular auteurs in our cultural ecosystem  shah rukh khans return to masala filmmaking perfectly showcases his acting talents for the uninitiated playing the dual role of azad and vikram rathore khan exudes glorious charisma and pitchperfect comedic timing as he continuously plays with his look and façade in front of the camera winking at the audience and quasibreaking the fourth wall to deliver his most fearless monologue on the power of voting khans screen presence remains unmatched and with the aid of tamil director atlee and musical director anirudh ravichander who also worked on lokeshs leo he stars in his best movie since chennai express and will hopefully pave the way for more spectacles involving the king sooner than later  no work of art has been more powerful in 2023 than renaissance a film by beyoncé not so much a concert film but a deeply personal look at beyoncé knowlescarter beyond the public façade she has constructed for over twenty years yes it could be considered a piece of hagiography but when the music she creates is this resonating and her cinematic approach to representing the highs and lows of the renaissance tour is so striking and evocative its hard not to be emotionally swelled by how at times grand and operatic the concert sequences are represented but also in how soulful the films quiet moments are shot some of the films purest moments do happen on stage diana ross showing up to sing happy birthday to beyoncé but most of them occur when she opens herself up to the world through her relationship with daughter blue ivy and parents tina and mathew the fact is unequivocal no one expresses herself like beyoncé or can even make a movie like her taylor swift tried with the eras tour but doesnt have the cinematic vision that beyoncé had with her renaissance tour picture its in my opinion the strongest and most powerful movie of 2023 and is still making me cry as i write these words thats the mark of something truly special 
Feb 29 2024,positive, 2023 a real odd but overall good year for movies it feels like every year the theatrical experience is in a different kind of trouble  this year it was a horrific strike that limited even the ability to talk about movies publicly without the absolutely insane barbenheimer event who knows where we would be  but this year also contained some legitimate classics of the form and i had a great time at the cinemas throughout the entire calendar  yeah this one might seem out of left field or maybe you havent heard of it i dont consider myself an expert in indian cinema  but i am an expert in me having a good time you like musicals romance comedy family drama and history this movie has all of that and more ranveer singh is a perfect lovable idiot  he doesnt know much but his heart is in the right place and alia bhatt perfection and i wont hear any arguments this is a long movie but it never feels like it  its a movie that makes me smile even when thinking about it do yourself a favor find this movie and watch it thank me later i find it interesting that as yorgos lanthimos gets more freedom he becomes more approachable as long as youre not a prude about sex poor things being this low on the list just shows you what a great year we had in 2023 emma stone deserves all of the praise that she is getting but i only hope that mark ruffalo gets the awards attention too he is on a special comedic level here but also visually this is one of the stunners of the year lanthimos clearly does not care about realism and uses the fantastical to allow us to just join in on both the wildness and the journey of his characters im just going to be clear here trace lysette gave the best performance of the year thats it she is absolutely perfect and as she has been discussing on social media if a cisgender person gave this performance it would be a guaranteed nomination if not win barring a huge surprise this will not happen for ms lysette but dont let that dissuade you monica was one of my favorite theater experiences of the year a silent discussion of depression familial trauma and small moments of healing this is what watching independent film in particular and cinema in general is all about i saw this movie early in the year and it has stuck with me and even improved with time what to say that hasnt been said i am a lover of christopher nolan films and this is his true epic in scale in story in pure gall and yet unlike many epics oppenheimer is an actors dream obviously cillian murphy is great and this has been talked to death but the gigantic cast they are all just right and serve the movie in ways that supporting characters rarely do yet despite this nolan also never loses sight of the bombast necessary to tell this particular story he manages to do it all character work special effects biopic and a lesson movie without feeling preachy kind of a miracle now that i think of it and here is the second best performance of the year sandra hüller truly makes you forget that she is acting you can literally pick any moment in the movie from her as her awards clip and if you know me you know that i do not appreciate most child performances but milo machadograner is different a truly moving stunning performance and story we can argue all day about whether she did it or not shes innocent but that may be the most uninteresting conversation in the whole film anatomy of a fall is so good and intimate it almost feels like you shouldnt be seeing it i wrote a whole review of this on this site scorsese incredibly has not lost a step this movie contains a performance so powerful that it makes you forget that she is acting against titans like dicaprio and deniro lily gladstone will likely be the first native american person to win an oscar and good for her she deserves it martin scorsese really is a master he finds a way to teach us both our part in tragedy and our responsibility as those who devour this media his choices in the final moments will stick with me for many many years  i am an easy mark for this kind of movie you want dave to support your movie just make it about longing  this has longing in spades i am still in disbelief that this was director celine songs first feature it is assured calm and has more depth than many experienced filmmakers greta lee teo yoo and john magaro create relationships that seem like peering into both past and future the possibilities the way our lives fork this movie says it all without spoon feeding and saying it out loud past lives is a treasure and will continue to be for many years  all of us strangers is heartbreaking all of us strangers is heart healing for those of us who have had to come out of the closet it tells a truth rarely told most of the stories are all accepting or all rejecting but often life is not like this the coming out story here is neither it is performed by people real humans with faults and struggles but beyond this all of us strangers is also a beautiful love story kind of watch it youll get what i mean both andrew scott and paul mescal are a perfect fit for their roles and for each other all of us strangers is a beautiful important painful watch and worth every second another film that i was lucky enough to review for insession film although it was surpassed in my list of best films this is likely the one i will come back to most if its not the best food movie ever it is just behind the great tampopo love is food food is love age and time dont matter love will conquer everything even if only for a short time the taste of things lives in my heart and probably always will i will admit this could be recency bias it also could be that jonathan glazer is exactly on my wavelength even more than most movies set during the holocaust the zone of interest is truly difficult to watch but the difficulties come for different reasons there is almost no violence witnessed on screen very little suffering besides the background sounds that we hear glazer spends the entire run time building to a daring moment in the third act in this moment you realized that the accusatory is not pointed solely at the evil germans but at humanity in general this movie shook me to my core and if you can move past the achingly slow pace it will for you too
Feb 1 2024,positive, christopher nolans sprawling biopic of j robert oppenheimer after a slowmoving opening to set the backstory finally comes into its own with the countdown before the trinity test near los alamos new mexico confirmed that an atomic bomb would work supposedly that site was chosen as no civilians were living in the area yet indigenous inhabitants did whether any of those were injured by the blast and fallout is never mentioned in the title role cillian murphy fits the physical emotional and intellectual requirements of the daunting role to a t oscar will be taking notice longsuffering former communist wife kitty is in good hands due to emily blunts wideranging performanceespecially her palatable disdain for those jealous of her husbands fame and success the only narrative weakness being her constant cocktail habit which soon becomes tiresome florence pugh gives a commendable take on the forever communist sometime lover of the intrepid scientist who definitely moves up in his profession as head of the manhattan project in a small but most important role tom conti fires on all cylinders as albert einstein kudos to the makeup and hair department who naturally provides telling advice and prediction of the future for oppenheimer the villain of the piece and in real life comes in the selfish treacherous form of lewis straussatomic energy commission chairman and eisenhower cabinet wannabe robert downey jr digs into the role with copious venom and ambition as required the most notable aspect of this production is nolans decision to let viewers imaginations fill in the truly horrific results of the abombs landing on hiroshima and nagasaki there are hints of that in some of the blackandwhite vague images then later assurances from president harry truman gary oldman a readily believable occupant of the white house that he was responsible for the bombingsnot oppenheimer dubbed father of the atomic bomb in the media once the dust settles and the war ends the remainder of the film delves into oppenheimers appearances in a kangaroo court setup anonymously by strauss to feed his political ambitions sadly importantly those hearings are all too close to the ongoing trials and tribulations for a former president whose crimes arelike straussrevengedriven but far removed from actual facts the timing couldnt have been better as always nolans nonlinear storytelling based on the book american prometheus the triumph and tragedy of j robert oppenheimer by kai bird and martin sherwin keeps the mind engaged even as the adroit cinematography from hoyte van hotema and superb editing thanks to jennifer lame becomes a visual feast the artistic icing on this generous cake comes in the form of copious amounts of nervous strings and forceful brass heard in ludwig göranssons most effective original score
Jan 25 2024,positive,pugh is heartbreaking but doesnt get to shine as much as emily blunt as oppenheimers wife kitty longsuffering thanks to her husbands obsessive career and dalliances blunt nonetheless provides needed steel for bob in the final scenes
Jan 3 2024,positive, roger ebert the father of modern film criticism loved that quote he knew that no critic can ever be objective and they shouldnt try to be every time we watch a film we view it through the prism of our own experiences critics can lean on their knowledge of film history their understanding of the technical aspects of filmmaking and their ardent passion for cinema to comprise an informed judgment on a movies merits but that doesnt begin to account for the most important thing why a film sticks with you what makes it lodge in your gut and stick there for days months even years afterward its a thing that cannot be explained because it occurs in that meeting place between an artistor the team of artists and craftspeople who make a filmand the individual viewer when you get right down to it the only difference between a very good film and a great one is how much each of us personally connects to its ideas and how theyre expressed for this critic 2023 was a hard year ill spare you the full details but it involved the loss of several beloved family pets the deterioration of one of my most important personal relationships and a lot of therapy there was both grief and loss i withdrew a bit from the world at some point i stopped reading the news at another point i finished a book on baseball cinema that will be published next year i leaned in to my passions and away from that which i had no control over i ceased reviewing new releases and took on the repertory cinema beat here at city paper revisiting the films of the past has been enlightening but it has also left me feeling a little out of touch as a critic thats not necessarily a bad thing as groupthink is poisonous to honest discourse i have found myself out of step with my colleagues on some of the most celebrated films of the year including oppenheimer i liked it but thought the third act nearly cratered the whole thing barbie and killers of the flower moon instead i found myself drawn to smaller independent films that portrayed and probed the simple pleasures of life art food desire family love and friendship films like are you there god its me margaret 5 the warm adaptation of the beloved judy blume novel about a jewish teenager growing up in suburban new jersey in the 70s its a film that finds universality in specificity and not just its perfect replication of 70sera fashion furniture and cars it captures the lowstakes anguish of puberty with startling insight i dont know what its like to buy tampons or worry about being the last person in your friend group to get their period  but i do know what its like to buy condoms before you need them and fret that youre going to be the oldest virgin on the planet written and directed by kelly fremon craig the film feels like a callback to the era of john hugheswhen we laughed at teenagers so we didnt cry for ourselves one of the great achievements of are you there god is in how it expands the role of the mother played winningly by rachel mcadams she has little to do in the book but the film delves honestly into her ambivalence over being a homemaker and her complicated relationship with her parents the compassion the film extends her reminds me of all of us strangers 4 a haunting romance about a lonely urbanite andrew scott who after striking up a romance with a sexy neighbor paul mescal finds himself drawn back to his hometown where his parents jamie bell and claire foy who died in a car crash when he was a child are miraculously still alive and unaged the romance is steamy enoughscott and mescal forge a chemistry that is both emotionally vulnerable and unbearably sexybut scott achieves a remarkable transformation in the scenes at home when he reveals his sexual identity to his parents its somewhere between a wish and a dream with scott becoming the 11yearold boy he once was without the aid of makeup or visual effects you dont need big budgets or movie stars to create dramatic tension just look to palm trees and power lines 6 and the teachers lounge 7 palm trees was dropped on hulu earlier this year after a festival run in 2022 nobody seemed to notice it or maybe the subject matter scared them off its about 17yearold lea lily mcinerny who bored and disgusted with her school friends embarks on a romance with a 34yearold guy jonathan tucker discerning adults will realize the trouble from the first time they lock eyes but firsttime feature director and cowriter jamie dack shows incredible discipline in letting her story play out through leas perspective when you get to the horrifying climax its both unthinkable and inevitable given the subject matter and the creative tightrope in pulling it off its courageous work from all involved the teachers lounge plays out more like a traditional thriller though without the explicit threat of violence the german film by ilker çatak concerns a new teacher at a public school dealing with an epidemic of theft her attempt to catch the thief seems to bring a quick resolution but nothing is simple in our world as it pertains to children safety and criminality leonie benesch is revelatory as the idealistic teacher trying to do the right thing at every turn and somehow getting herself in deeper with her students their parents and eventually her colleagues is it possible to do the right thing in our world is it even worth it the teachers lounge asks those questions and smartly doesnt try to answer them  maybe we should just keep telling the story thats the advice the playwright gives  the actor in asteroid city 9 wes andersons exploration of terrestrial and extraterrestrial life set at a junior stargazing convention in a small desert town anderson bounces his cast of troubled adults and observant children against each other while building in a nesting doll narrative structure and painting some of the richest most pleasing hues of his career as i pondered the loss of my beloved dogs this year did i relate to jason schwartzmans grieving widower did i spend a few nights gazing at the stars and pondering my place in the universe did i worry about how to tell the childrenmy remaining dogsthe news yes i did but i also warmly recalled andersons blue desert sky once or twice amid months of thinking about how we use art to both heal and relive our traumas  or we could just rely on each other thats how the central trio in the holdovers 8 gets through a mercilessly cold two weeks at a new england boarding school its christmas vacation and they have nowhere else to go angus newcomer dominic sessa has been abandoned by his mother and new stepdad mr hunham paul giamatti has drawn the short straw and been tasked with supervising angus and cafeteria manager mary davine joy randolph in a performance thats already winning awards has to stick around and make sure the men dont die of starvation each character is prickly in their own way but they quickly warm to one another their time and ours is spent trying to help each other heal making the holdovers the warmest film of director alexander paynes career if not one of his best certainly the one i needed at the end of this year theres also a warmth in showing up 10 and afire 3 although it doesnt seem like it at first kelly reichardts showing up opens on a frustrated sculptor michelle williams rushing an injured pigeon out of her window so it can die in the street afire concerns itself with a miserable writer thomas schubert whose vacation with his best friend is nearly ruined by his own defensiveness neither character is particularly sympathetic at the outset the only reason they earn our compassion is from how caringly they are portrayed by the filmmaker christian petzold and actors over the course of these films we get to know and love these fictional artists not because theyre flawless people but because simply they are people with all their flaws and complexities williams and schubert play characters who would be fast friends if they ever mettheir insecurities would join them at the hipbut they have to scrape and claw for every little bit of peace in the world in watching them find it we might find a little peace for ourselves i had the same wish for the anonymous protagonist of david finchers the killer 2 and i might have been the only one many otherwise intelligent people found this to be a cold and calculating genre exercise i thought it was one of the warmest and funniest films of the year the film opens with our anonymous protagonist michael fassbender preparing for a job demonstrating and explaining to us in a hilarious voiceover the discipline that it takes to perform his task well he shares personal mantrasforbid empathy fight only the battle youre paid to fightthat seem to have been taken from a 21stcentury dudebro selfhelp book  he makes clear that these rules are the very foundation of his lifethen he proceeds to break every one of them the killer is certain he is one thing but shows us with his every decision that hes actually another it makes him a fool a tragic hero and an avatar for every adult living on this planet if you accept the framework of the killers lifethat he commits murder for a livingyou can see him striving toward connection and compassion within it its there in the way he murders a cab driver quickly and without warning sparing him from as another character later puts it the worst nightmare of being aware of your impending death wait isnt that all of us its there in his aliases all of which represent characters from 70s and 80s sitcoms its like hes waiting for some bank teller or rental car associate to recognize the name sam malone and share a laugh with him but they never do hardly a genre exercise the killer is a selfreferential work in which fincher acknowledges his own reputation as a controlling director and digs under the surface to find the quivering child beneath hes there but you have to look for him speaking of quivering my favorite film of the year is the taste of things 1 the most tender film of 2023 i regret that it wont hit most theaters until feb 14 but i cant imagine a more perfect release date than valentines day the french romance chronicles the relationship between dodin benoît magimel a 19thcentury landowner and his cook and sometimes lover eugenie juliette binoche it opens on a 20minute scene of the duo preparing an extravagant meal for dodin and his friends and while its one of the most sensual experiences ever put on filmyou can hear every knife cutting through flesh and smell every simmering rouxit never tips over into what we would today call food porn its not a film for people who use pleasure to escape life its for those who believe food is art and art is life so is love dodin and eugenie share a bed every now and then he wants them to marry she simply wants to be his cook and lover is this simply the most french film ever made endorsing food as religion and a relationship between a boss and his woman employee as not only acceptable but ideal sure thats one way to see it id say it bathes you in ephemerality arguing in its gentle naturalistic aesthetic that you can savor life without trying to hold onto it in the end life will prove it to you anyway enjoy yourself while youre here get to know yourself and others know who the man is watching that movie for the more you know yourself the more you can know the world we dont have one readers like you keep our work free for everyone to read if you think that its important to have high quality local reporting we hope youll support our work with a monthly contribution
Jan 1 2024,positive, oppenheimer inspired by the book american prometheus which robert pattinson gifted to director nolan recounts j robert oppenheimers cillian murphy life beginning with his school years moving through the dropping of the atom bomb and ending with his security hearing even as a young adult physics and the inner workings of the world fascinate so much so that hes distracted from life in front of him other sciences socialization and relationships  while in school he meets isidor rabi david krumholtz who is already familiar with his work this leads to a meeting with werner heisenberg matthias schweighöfer and eventual recruitment by lewis strauss robert downey jr for harvard upon accepting the job and with few students signing up for his classes he befriends ernest lawrence josh hartnett and is eventually recruited again only this time by the government  general leslie groves matt damon wants oppenheimer to catch america up in the arms race this leads to the development thanks to ingenuity of the manhattan project the science doesnt quite exist and much of what theyre doing is an experiment but amid communism scares wwii and scandal the project leaders and scientists make the deadline for the test few of them are prepared for the quickness with which the american government takes the project away oppenheimer is stunned and tortured because of the devastation and guilt but president truman gary oldman takes the blame  the president does not take oppenheimers advice that the country reexamine americas use of the bomb though its too late j robert oppenehimers late life leads to a review of his security clearance which is almost concurrent with one of his original supporters and recruiters senator strauss seeking to gain approval for his nomination as secretary of commerce the beauty of that summary doesnt lie in the fact that the summary is historical and obviously pushes back against spoilers the beauty is how that traditional timeline is stretched and deviated by nolan in a way that only he can nolan is a master of adding tension where there is very little while deflating strenuous moments and creating an environment that is almost unbearable oppenheimer ebbs between tension and stress manipulating time in a way reminiscent of dunkirk which i often label as nolans perfect work weeks after the release of nolans latest and im not sure about my rankings anymore nolans fictional work is what hes often known for but the work hes doing by reimagining history might be what cements his career one of the key elements of the film is sound and how its withheld and overdone the audience wont hear explosions when they expect them yet we do experience an abundance of cacophony including cheering applause and mechanization oppenheimer isnt all sound either its visually stunning and delicate light when possible and dark when necessary one of the few criticisms of the film which continues a necessary discussion thats never finished is the portrayal of women and their overall absence women were disproportionately represented in the field of science during the time of the manhattan project 38 of women held a college degree at the time so their presence on location wasnt expected yet some audience members myself included couldnt get past how oppenheimer interacted with women regardless of whether the interactions were realistic or not  his friend and hidden partner jean tatlock florence pugh never meets his wife kitty oppenheimer emily blunt though they have one scene together the female students secretaries and scientists dont interact with one another either the film overtly fails the adopted bechdel test continually noted as a joke yet the joke still compels people to inquire if a film sidelines an entire gender the test highlights moments audiences may casually overlook but maybe this movie doesnt really need to pass it anyway oppenheimer was deemed a womanizer in the movie and the lack of female characters interacting is a reflection of that there are two additional ideas that might undercut that claim though in general nolan doesnt typically write about female characterstheres a debate about representation with murphy jessica chastain and brand anne hatheway in interstellarand additionally the main women in the film fall into the mistress and wifemother category a little too easy this may underscore oppenheimers use of them in this way but nevertheless i did find it unfortunate to see the reduction maybe this comes back to the idea and claim long before the films debut that we dont need more stories about powerful small white men even though the interpretation of their stature by the end is remarkable what impresses me most about oppenheimer is nolans trajectory many fans began following his career after his work on batman moving backwards to catch some of his more grounded work like memento though i personally havent seen the following yet i appreciate that similar to a poet nolan is often telling the same story repeatedly just with refined techniques hes always curious about humanity and what makes a person human its the throughline on all of his work whether were watching bruce wayne recover from trauma by giving up his humanity or soldiers on the shore of dunkirk mustering the last ounces  nolan is one of the few directors whose themes barely change while the outward dressing is always shifting  the techniques are similar as well but he harnesses them more and more over time everyone entered oppenheimer curious how nolan would create a bomb with practical effects no cgi and minimal vfx work he is a master and only the best can do what he does the withholding of what audiences want or expect the delayed gratification and reassembly later on in a schema we werent expecting developing the atom bomb was a heinous act its one of hundreds of low moments for mankind but what i appreciate about everyone involved is that the film refuses to create winners every character is so small by the close of the 3hour film whether they admit it or not they are changed j robert oppenheimer is the smallest of anyone by films end still a man scientist and great mind but lesser and nolan makes that undeniable its been several weeks and id still rank this a 5 out of 5 if you were intimidated by barbenheimer or the soldout 247 imax seats make sure to catch this before it leaves theaters disneys percy jackson and the olympians takes bold risks in reimagining the iconic series for a new audience as the heart of the show lies in its young heroes
Jan 1 2024,positive, oppenheimer is not a joy to behold but it is a fascinating motion picture everyone should seeand absorb it is also likely to be heralded at the oscars as best picture  as a boomer the film personally connects being a high school varsity debater in 1965 i verbally sparred about the threat of nuclear war with russia peaceful coexistence was an oft used termcoming from teens who had ducked and covered in classroom drills during the 1950s it was all about the threat of the atomic bomb which by the mid 60s had escalated to the hydrogen bomb twenty years earlier in 1945 wwii ended with our atom bombs devastating japan  the story structure begins during oppenheimers 1926 university year and stays its course through nuclear discoveries in the late 1930s to wwii developments both military and scientific and then to postwar years with presidents truman through johnson  oppenheimers murphy love life is included focusing on dating jean tatlock pugh a communist party member this was the beginning of the upending of oppenheimers controversial political leanings not only does he have friends who are communist party members but ends up marrying katherine kitty played by blunt an exmember it is no surprise that the brilliant scientist becomes the focus of house unamerican activities accusations his personal life becomes fodder for political retribution despite the fact his quantum physics expertise led to the development and eventual dropping of the atom bomb on japan that ended wwii  a major player in the movie is robert downey jr who does a fine job as oppenheimers nemesis lewis strauss the atomic energy commissions chairman strauss held a long time resentment of oppenheimer and used his testimony to strip oppenheimer of security clearance thus oppenheimer was blocked from anything to do with nuclear research this sequence occurs in the third hour of the film before that happens we witness oppenheimer in full power as he heads a team in los alamos new mexico to develop a nuclear bomb to end the war  it is fascinating to witness the recreation of that town built to house the scientists and technicians and their families while work proceeds it all had to do with privacy and expediency and it worked interestingly the films structure is laced with flashback sequences necessary for context references also much of the story is narrated by straussdowney jr to minimize any confusion regarding the storys pointofview director nolan chose to film oppenheimers sequences in color strausss stances are shown in black and white the result is subtle and clarifying it truly helps in a movie as complex as oppenheimer certainly is  oppenheimer is packed with outstanding performances particularly by the mostly unknown cillian murphy he not only greatly resembles the brooding main character but is totally believable  there were things about the famous during those years i found fascinating take albert einstein as portrayed by tom conti and i am still jarred by the persona of president harry truman gary oldman i will not detail the latter here but i had to research it after seeing the film to verify he did indeed say such to and about dr oppenheimer 
Jan 1 2024,positive, following the film stages collective top 50 films of 2023 as part of our yearend coverage our contributors are sharing their personal top 10 lists after 2022 left me feeling a bit out in weeds in regards to film culture both the state of movies in general and especially the ones that got people the most amped up that kept leaving me disappointed i came into 2023 a pessimist and left with a rejuvenated belief that the movies are indeed back this year was overflowing with riches to the point where even up until this very moment im mentally swapping in and out some titles for the list youre about to see of my annual favorites theres just too many gems i dont want to leave behind and they came in all shapes and sizes from some of my favorite directors making highly anticipated returns including one for their final feature to filmmakers ive always been cold on for the first time making something that has nestled its way into my heart and promises to remain there for eternity the even bigger surprise is that while not all of my personal selections are in the mix for major awards attention its actually looking pretty solid that a large portion of them will somehow the sky has opened up and things look bright again  that makes my list feel perhaps a little pedestriancertainly more than last year in which not a single one of my top ten selections earned an academy award nominationbut ive definitely got some more esoteric choices thrown into the mix as well  to see my full ranking of 2023 releases you can check out my list on letterboxd there youll also find my ranked list of all the non2023 titles that i saw for the first time this year that selection is highlighted by between the lines the bridges of madison county choose me tr baskin victims of sin and rolling thunder  a tender little romance between two people isolated from much of society cast down and out as they make their way through the days until by chance they find a connection with one another fallen leaves rides the wave between gentle transcendence and inimitable cool our finnish comp to jim jarmusch aki kaurismäki is in top form with another feature that gives you the urge to smoke a cigarette and hit the town at night through the romance fallen leaves takes on some larger themes tackling notions of masculinity and the many layers of what it actually means to be a manwhich isnt hiding from your problems in isolation or in the bottle its also disarmingly funny at times with kaurismäkis dry as sandpaper wit really shining in moments that had me in stitchesprobably one of the most hilarious movies of the year  if the burial had come out 15 years ago i probably would have given it a c and called it unremarkable in 2023 it feels like a revelation a 90s throwback courtroom drama with two alisters and a strong supporting cast a mixture of character introspection rich macro themes legal investigation and a david vs goliath battle an honestly surprising amount of genuinely effective comedic bits margaret betts navigates the more interestingthanyoudexpect tone of this so well aided by a stellar jamie foxx performance at the head perfectly instilling a showboating ambulancechasing huckster persona with deeprooted insecurities that start to crack and a desire to do something greater tommy lee jones dials back the curmudgeon vibes for a really sincere performance of a belittled everyman who wants to see these exploitative vampires pay theyre an odd pairing who work really well together and you get invested in seeing their parallel journey for the cause the burial is an unbelievably charming slice of comfort food the type of movie we took for granted when it was all the rage and now doesnt exist anymore inspired by the likes of viscontis the innocent akermans je tu il elle and ripplohs taxi zum klo ira sachs delivers the best film of his career with the steamy tale of tomas franz rogowski continuing to make the argument that hes our finest actor the dictionary definition of a chaotic bisexual as tomas tears through lovers old ben whishaws martin his husband and new adèle exarchopouloss agathe the woman he cheats with we wonder just what kind of wreckage hell unleash upon those in his orbit next theres an intoxicating roller coaster of emotions that passages takes us on the sort of train wreck we cant look away from tomas is infuriating exhausting and yet in some strange ways admirablehes unabashedly himself down to his dynamic fashion choices that rank among the best costume design of the year also in the best of the year conversation is josée deshaies cinematography using ingenious framing and blocking techniques to emphasize the torrential emotional interiority of the characters in every scene white mans greed is a volatile thing so easily manipulated into carnage so fragile and always on the lookout for threats whether its money sex or land it all boils down to one thing power the power theyve held for so long and the power they refuse to relinquish in any capacity the machinery of white supremacy is the center of killers of the flower moon and unlike scorseses many cautionary tales depicting the folly of greedy men theres no fun to be had here no invitation into the thrill of the moment like the irishman scorseses latest has a funereal tone to it but its not a eulogy for these men for this way of life for the realization that theyve lived it all for nothing  its a eulogy for a country for an entire culture of people who are being washed away by the unrelenting violence of white men after a staggering meta moment where the director turns the lens on himself and his own place within the machine flower moon crescendos with a powerful drumming a statement that after all of this the osage live on theyll still tell their stories the way they always have theyll still look after each other theyll still beat these drums and their fight wont surrender the killer feels like the rosetta stone for david fincher the core of his entire thesis as an artist a man who exists in exactitudes in process and efficiency yet hes undone by the unpredictability of human beings and the mercy of having to operate within the structures of our modern world it is also like fincher himself remarkably funny in a wry unassuming waywhether its the opening 20minute sequence of the eponymous figure telling us how hes a calculated master of his game only to screw the pooch in the most obvious way possible the cheeky product placement like michael fassbender describing why he gets mcdonalds every day because its the perfect way to blend in as a coldblooded murderer or sight gags like the dog busting through the glass door at the same time its an incredibly engaging process movie as we watch this man execute plans step by step see them play out perfectly or have to watch him adapt when things go awry its lean mean and remarkably efficient just like the character and just like fincher the final feature of legendary filmmaker william friedkin the caine mutiny courtmartial sent him out on a high remarkably bold in its formal and aesthetic approach the courtroom drama is practically bressonian in its minimalism and removal from conventional cinematic attributes almost the entire picture is composed of tight shots on the actors including one final riveting performance from the late lance reddick less than ten of them contained in this one setting where a series of witnesses are called to sit in a chair and be grilled by opposing lawyers we are in this room for these two hours and thats it we see it all unfold and its up to us to make interpretations or judgments if we wish as to who these people really are its absolutely gripping cinema a violent reckoning with americas bloodlust filtered through a man whose ego and naïveté facilitated one of the most unspeakable monstrosities in the history of the world an unprecedented devastation that still reverberates through civilizations today wisely oppenheimer never paints the man as a victim nor as a tortured genius hes something else entirely an explorer who doesnt stop to think about what his discovery will mean a man who tries to be neutral who doesnt have a stance he believes he has morality but theres no conviction  or if there is its overrun by his need for fame and the blinders he puts on to the real world thats a more damning statement than anything else that he can destroy so much and end up on the cover of time magazine as some sort of hero oppenheimer leaves us with the unshakable threat of nuclear holocaust hanging over us but its not just that its any of the many ways that men in suits have destroyed our world to line their pockets whether its the plenty of other genocides that have occurred economic disparity the annihilation of the climate the scours of people who have died due to a preventable virus because these people left the world to rot the latest masterpiece from christian petzold one of our finest filmmakers afire is catnip for insecure resentful bitter and judgmental writers who are decently talented but not nearly as good as they think they are or want to be in other words this had me eating out of the palm of its hand stepping away from the semimythic tales petzolds been weaving in his past three features this is a sometimes hilarious sometimes scathing always gripping jaunt thats clearly in conversation with the works of éric rohmer as light on its feet as afire is theres also an indictment of that very fact as these characters find themselves so consumed by their petty foibles and narcissism while less than 50km away forest fires are wreaking havoc through communities and wildlife they are constantly faced with how meaningless all of this actually is and yet they cant help themselves none of us can the world will always revolve around us even when we can see the tragedy right in front of our eyes its okay it wont hit us its just over there until its not alexander payne has expressed issues with people describing the holdovers as a cozy film but in doing so hes misinterpreting what people mean by that cozy doesnt mean saccharine or schmaltzy this film is certainly not that beyond the inherently cozy nature of the storys setting in time period location and season the coziness comes from its gentle gradual unraveling of its characters layers the coziness comes from allowing us the gift of time and space to simply exist with these three people and learn about them as they learn about each other to grapple with their griefs their melancholy their anger their disappointment the same way that we grapple with our own the holdovers is a bitter movie but its not a cynical one it finds value in the small victories even if thats just as small as having someone sit next to you so you feel less alone when youre completely alienated from the rest of the world 2023 was the year of the courtroom drama see 4 and 8 and parts of both 3 and 6 and justine triets palme dor winner brought us into the specifically nutty circus of the french court system where a woman is put to the task of defending herself against accusations of murdering her husband a riveting investigation occurs on the stand as shes hounded by a supremely snarky prosecutor and the media puts her under the microscope but whats most fascinating about anatomy of a fall is its slow dissection into the anatomy of the marriage itself each scene uncovers new layers in their relationship exploring the ways in which we all build up resentment ache jealousy and sometimes even rage over time were any of our spouses to perish under unusual circumstances would we not also be the most glaring suspect  mitchell beaupre is the senior

the father of the atomic bomb during world war ii during the red scare of the 1950s he falls from grace because of nonpolitical ties to communists besides the trinity test in the desert much of the action becomes backroom betrayal and kangaroo court sparring a conventional contrasting character study between oppenheimer and his former boss lewis strauss robert downey jr that gets told in an unconventional way alternating between charting oppenheimers career the 1958 senate hearings on strauss nomination to secretary of commerce and the 1954 us atomic energy commission deliberating

Dec 29 2023,positive, many films about powderkeg men tend to be little more than a 90minute lit fuse john trengoves dark claustrophobic and very closetohome manodrome has the slowchurning tension weve come to expect from stories about loners getting ready to blow but watching the downfall of ralphie jesse eisenberg a scared and drifting bundle of neuroses and sallow discontent feels like a larger societal indictment  with oppenheimer possibly the most anticipated film of 2023 christopher nolan has hit a home run yet again but has done so by subverting our expectations reinventing himself  and detonating the scale and scope of what we thought was possible in moviemaking it is a drama about the creation of the atomic bomb thats not much concerned with the bomb at all its a character study of a man whose character remains impenetrable to this day it is a relentless examination of ethical and moral decisionmaking in a situation where no outcome could possibly be ruled ethically or morally right more than anything oppenheimer is a tale of selling global domination as utilitarian benevolence by heaps of men posing as patriots but essentially uninterested in anything except their own position in the new world order  one of recent memorys most impressive writing and directing debuts celine songs past lives creates heartpounding drama out of the teensiest slivers of story decades

corner of the overcrowded comic book cinemaverse is worth paying attention to now that is the miles morales series it started with 2018s smashingly fun spiderman into the spiderverse and continues with this hyperactive winningly sweet and gorgeously drawn animated adventure  zar amir ebrahimi and guy nattivs tatami is a quietly impressive film with time it might well be considered a masterpiece tatamis monochrome cinematography perhaps unconsciously builds on the political conflicts within the story between the coercion of the islamic republic and leilas arienne mandi resistance to feign an injury at the judo world championships tatami is a political film but its also a story about the conflict and unimaginable choice between the love of ones family and ones values its suspense derives from the films engagement with the audience we feel the weight of pressure on leila and anger towards the agents of the islamic republic who lurk issuing her with threatening ultimatums we fear for the safety of leilas husband and daughter and we feel anger towards her parents who also tried to coerce her indeed tatami stirs the audiences emotions to fuel the suspense ill go to war for you

one a firecracker debut by writerdirector alina victoria rockwell and a showcase for star teyana taylors rich talent one part family drama but a 101part gutwrenching tale of the appalling reality of black women and men surviving on the streets this understated tactful film reaches incredible heights through the thoughtful subtlety of the script and the loud fearlessness of taylors performance  over more than a decade 19942005 we watch inez fight with all shes got to build a functional home for her kind and gifted son amid incessant gentrification institutional racism and problematic personal relationships despite her crime we start rooting for her nobody gives a shit about black women except black women and even that shit get messy inez screams at one point winning over sympathy not by victimizing herself but for persevering despite a dire pole position and endless hurdles as inspiring as it is to watch taylor soar as a me against the world hustler the real marvel here is rockwell who commands every word and frame with maturity and poise seldom seen in young auteurs  jonathan glazers adaptation of martin amis novel the zone of interest is the years most unsettling film focusing on the commandant of auschwitz and his wifes idyllic life in the house and garden next door to the concentration camp we only hear the sounds of cries and machinery and see smoke rise from the chimneys refusing to look upon the horror conveys the nazi indifference towards the jews and emphasises the inhumane cruelty that permitted the genocidal atrocities watching the mundane rituals the familys comfort and security while on the other side of a wall human beings are deprived of life and dignity is a provocative statement whats striking is how the zone of interest utilises the power of the spoken word to express the disturbing events that it refuses to gaze upon the rudimentary and practical conversation about the efficiency of the incinerators for example contextualises the passive acceptance of industrialised slaughter as pardon the choice of phrase business as usual
Dec 27 2023,positive, its finally time to talk oppenheimer here on the mam main feed thanks to our vips for digging into the episode last week did christopher nolan deliver the goods with this one lets discuss
Dec 22 2023,positive, if you add the first title on this list to the last one you get the biggest moviegoing event of the year it feels fitting to bookend 2023s ranking with barbenheimer a moment of sheer unadulterated enthusiasm for movies that drove box office numbers through the roof because when i think back on the year in film i still feel giddy it was a terrific year at the movies heavyweights such as ari aster greta gerwig christopher nolan and martin scorsese delivered careerdefining works while newcomers chloe domont molly manning walker and celine song surprised us with films we couldnt stop talking about coming up with 10 movies i was eager to endorse was easy and i havent even seen poor things yet but 2023 wasnt all rainbows and brightyellow rollerblades in may the writers guild of america went on strike with screenwriters demanding higher wages and job security to keep up with the nebulous streaming landscape in july sagaftra followed suit the strikes kept hollywood quiet for several months pushing projects such as dune part two into next year much more importantly they underscored the industrys dire need for change  then a few trying months later it got some the wga reached what they called an exceptional deal in september while sagaftra approved a new contract with bonuses and protections in november hollywood is still recovering from the pause in work and its still an imperfect industry for working writers and actors but its a step in the right direction we gave it a viral marketing campaign free of charge we went to movie theaters in droves to watch it we debated about whether it was a groundbreaking work of feminism its not or merely a twohour advertisement for a toy company mattel made it so yeah gerwigs barbie became so central to the zeitgeist this year that its easy to lose sight of how deeply bizarre the whole thing is of course barbie is a brand extension exercise but its an audacious hilarious and artistically crafted one raising the bar considerably for bigbudget intellectual property ventures to come what makes a good life thats the question at the center of chronicles of a wandering saint a small special film by newcomer tomás gómez bustillo that played this years latin american film festival rita mónica villa is an elderly custodian obsessed with becoming the most pious resident of her rural argentine town with a needle drop youll want to write home about chronicles takes a magical realist turn that forces rita to realize that getting what you prayed for isnt all its made out to be ostensibly asters departure from horror beau is afraid might be the directors scariest film yet a sprawling uncanny threehour fever dream the movie is an odyssey through the psyche of beau joaquin phoenix a middleaged jewish guy with a pocket full of mommy and daddy issues beau is afraid takes a lot of big swings and comes up with more than a few misses but it also hits a few home runs offering brilliant farcical depictions of a mind tortured by anxiety judy blume had declined numerous offers to option her beloved book are you there god its me margaret over the years knowing that her 1970 novel which follows an insightful 11yearold through her puberty growing pains had become a sacred text to girls everywhere she finally handed the rights over to kelly fremon craig the edge of seventeen and the resulting adaptation is a tender window into girlhood and family that slightly expands the scope of its source text without sacrificing any of its wisdom scorsese and leonardo dicaprio have once again teamed up to make a movie about greedy evil men but this is no wolf of wall street killers of the flower moon tells the true story of the systematic murdering of osage nation members in 1920s oklahoma carried out by white men who were after osage oil money dicaprio and robert de niro are superbly monstrous while lily gladstone is remarkably enigmatic as mollie kyle well over three hours long killers doesnt exactly go down easy but rises to the brutal occasion at hand resulting in one of the greatest cinematic feats of the year at the center of may december is the terrible tabloid affair between gracie julianne moore and joe charles melton whose relationship began when joe was in the seventh grade and gracie was 24 years his senior usually most of us wouldnt spend more than one people magazine article with such a story but director todd haynes brings us intimately close to the controversial couple through the eyes of elizabeth natalie portman who is shadowing the lispy gracie for an upcoming movie may december is a disturbing portrait of abuse and a campy parody of performance when samuel falls to his death from the balcony of his alpine chalet all eyes are on his wife a successful unapologetic writer named sandra an excellent sandra hüller justine triets palme dor winning anatomy of a fall begins as a gripping courtroom drama about whether sandra murdered her husband then transforms into a forensic analysis of a marriage between two flawed people raising rich questions about gender partnership and love brands had quite the spring at the movies march saw the release of flamin hot and tetris two films depicting the inception of their title products air ben affleck and matt damons ode to the minds behind nikes air jordan shoe arrived in april by the time matt johnsons blackberry rolled around in may the world seemed ready to move on from the corporate origin story and with good reason but its a shame that blackberry emerged in the shadow of those movies because it couldnt be further from the airs and flamin hots of the world instead of worshiping at the altar of its title brand blackberry scrutinizes the people and the system that created it making it more akin to david finchers the social network jay baruchel is wonderful as blackberry creator mike lazaridis but its glenn howerton who steals the show as coceo jim balsillie giving a hysterical hottempered performance that could slot right into an episode of succession movies do a lot of things they entertain they educate they make audiences laugh and cry and jump out of their upholstered reclining seats and on special occasions they linger imparting an image feeling or idea that leaves their viewer a bit different than they were before past lives is a special occasion celine songs stirring debut feature revolves around a few key moments in the lives of a new yorkbased writer greta lee the childhood sweetheart she left in korea teo yoo and her loving presentday husband john magaro the films beating heart is the korean concept of inyun which suggests that people gravitate to each other because they overlapped in a previous lifetime though small in scope past lives is emotionally enormous unearthing a bittersweet truth about the lives we lead with the people we loveand lives and people we never get to the morning of barbenheimer a holiday i had anticipated like it was christmas a series of logistical misfortunes fit for a sitcom caused my friend and me to arrive late to the theater by the time we tiptoed our way into our seats for oppenheimer the manhattan project was already underway despite our 27minute fumble oppenheimer delivered one of the most exhilarating and harrowing movie theater experiences ive ever had painting a largerthanlife portrait of powerboth nuclear and politicalpetulance and penitence  days later i returned to the theater to see it in its entirety and that riveting first watch shriveled in comparison though i wouldnt exactly recommend it accidentally watching oppenheimer like it was nolans 2000 timebending thriller memento made the directors gift for storytelling plain as day nolans careerlong interest in timeline manipulation has been the subject of praise and the punchline of jokes here its the making of a masterpiece elevating what in lesser hands could have been a conventional historical drama into an urgent unforgettable work with great artistry and relentless precision oppenheimer tells the story of the man who created the nuclear bomb and was haunted by the fallout for the rest of his life pay attention and youll be haunted too we dont have one readers like you keep our work free for everyone to read if you think that its important to have high quality local reporting we hope youll

Dec 15 2023,negative, christopher nolans muchtouted three hour bio pic oppenheimer presents itself as a serious look at the complex moral depth of a brilliant man but really its just a standard hollywood hagiography which uses standardissue hollywood emotional and intellectual shortcuts to enlist the audience in patriotic horseshit from his cowardly refusal to give a single japanese victim a speaking role to his manipulative use of black and white to give sentimental nonsense a patina of authenticity nolan wallows in lazy glib filmmaking designed to turn the incineration of hundreds of thousands into a mellow righteous glow of selfcongratulation critics who have embraced this nonsense should be ashamed of themselves the unwieldy endless threehour movie is more or less framed around oppenheimers 1954 security hearing in which he was stripped of security clearance and disgraced because of his past communist ties and because of his discomfort with developing the hbomb oppenheimer cillian murphy tells his life story to the committee as nolan cuts away to portray that life via epic blaring soundtrack and interpolation of dramatic incendiary graphics illustrating the atomic whoosh and boom inside oppenheimers head more pedestrianly the movie follows oppenheimer as a young man studying the new physics in europe emphasizing his brilliance his idiosyncrasy his passion for justice which leads him into communist circles his philandering his ambition and his hatred of the nazis all of this culminates in his leadership of the manhattan project and the successful development of the atomic bomb which is dropped on japan rather than germany sparking in oppenheimer ambivalent doubts again the movie makes a pretense of sharing or exploring those doubts but the truth is nolan couldnt care less about the question of whether it was a good idea to drop not one but two atomic bombs and kill hundreds of thousands of non combatants including children and you can tell he doesnt care because he raises these issues most insistently in the context of that security clearance hearing which he presents as the most immoral thing in the filmfar more immoral than murdering civilians the hearing is were told payback from bureaucrat lewis strauss robert downey jr who oppenheimer once embarrassed in a public hearing strauss decides to destroy oppenheimers career as payback leaking his security file to a rabid anticommunist with ties to j edgar hoover the hearing is presented as a farce and strauss eventually ends up ranting like a supervillain his manipulations condemned even by his own supine staff the actual ethics of oppenheimers complicity in the bomb is gently nuked by the familiar mechanics of melodrama oppenheimer becomes the good guy by virtue of being persecuted by the bad guy the corpses the good guy is responsible for are relegated to hallucinatory dream where their moral weight is secondary to their role as symbolic demonstrations of the intricacies of his character the film uses the anti communist witch hunts to duck the ethics of nuclear annihilation but it doesnt really deal with the ethics of the witch hunts either were told over and over that oppenheimer was never a real communist which allows the movie to mostly avoid taking sides on whether persecuting actual communists was justified or not the most prominent party member in the film oppenheimers lover jean tatlock florence pugh is carefully delegitimized shes presented as mentally unstable in no small part through persistent hypersexualization much of the discussion of tatlock has centered on whether portraying sex and nudity in film is ever justified which has neatly elided what the sex and nudity in this film is doing oppenheimer has a number of lovers but tatlock is the only one shown topless or having sex with him at all and shes practically more nude in the movie than not nudity in this film isnt equated with pleasure sensuality or selfexploration as in for example dont worry darling instead its linked to exposure and humiliation in the scene where he discusses his relationship with tatlock before the committee oppenheimer himself is nude and we see him and jean having sex before the censorious security inspectors in a half dream sequence thats meant to cast the judges as voyeurs and oppenheimer as helpless  oppenheimers nudity is weakness by extension so is jeans in this scene and in others the nudity and sex are necessary because the nudity and sex are the primary way through which the film characterizes tatlock as unstable and pitiful her communist beliefs are less important than the bare skin that strips them of meaning since sex is who tatlock is you dont need to think too much about whether her ideas influenced oppenheimer ultimately oppenheimers most important relationship in the film isnt with tatlock or strauss or his wife but with einstein tom conti einstein only has a walk on part but the short encounters between the two men are thematically central thats especially the case for a discussion after the bomb has been dropped which is revisited multiple times once at the very end of the film the exchange takes place outside standing beside a scenic pond einstein whitehaired wise man and god surrogate gives oppenheimer his blessing assuring him that his legacy is important and that the guilt he bears is a kind of sanctification oppenheimer reiterates his loyalty to the united states and then in an ectomorphic beatific close up utters some sententious lines about how he set off a chain reaction which destroyed the world and what is that moral it gently evaporates in a gush of deference and aweat the hugeness of the bomb and the hugeness of hollywood oppenheimer like nolan is the director of vast human resources in pursuit of a massive payload the actual meaning or use of the mechanism is less important than its powera power which justifies both the creator and the nationstate in whose name the power is deployed as viet thanh nguyen has argued the hollywood industrial complexis crucial to the military industrial complex americas military superiority is justified and advanced by its massively disproportionate control of representation ideology memory and history its in that context that nolan tells us that oppenheimer is a good american and a good man not despite the deaths on his conscience but precisely because those deaths make him complicated and cool vacuous hagiography is indistinguishable from vacuous nationalism is indistinguishable from the romanticization of overwhelming force in the form of a huge honking explosion andor the huge honking movie that blandly justifies it thanks noah your review is the best one i have read as one who has worked in nuclear and especially in the endless cleanup of the nuclear weapons complex i too had very mixed reactions to this film i have visited and worked in many of these facilities your words helped me solidify my basic feeling that this is a terrible movie thanks great review
Dec 9 2023,positive, is the franchise era over in 2023 a slew of superhero movies earned hundreds of millions of dollars at the box office each and still reportedly failed to make back the money required to produce and market them not even tom cruise 2022s box office savior could rescue a mission impossible movie from the installment fatigue that has set in across multiplexes  a kind of invasive exhaustion thats made even the most reliable or put another way formulaic of animated features falter in theaters all this uncertainty raises a natural question if franchises are dead whats next as our critics thumbed through the many many movie releases of 2023 to determine their favorites from the past year that question loomed are there hints for whats to come postbarbenheimer in the kinds of films that broke through for them when a paul ruddled marvel title couldnt greta gerwigs and christopher nolans historic releases perhaps provide some clues though only one of them made our critics top10 lists in the end after sifting through the tumult bilge ebiri and alison willmore landed on 10 very different films each  not one movie choice made the others list still there are similarities filmmakers with a penchant for autobiography made both records movies that clock the existential confusion of being locked inside a career did too and in a year when it feels safer than ever to say superhero movies are throttling toward their own demise one of them ended up in our top 20 perhaps the best answer to what comes next is simply more chaos justine triets palme dorwinning courtroom drama about a woman accused of killing her husband after he falls to his death in suspicious fashion would be gripping enough as a procedural but it gains transcendence as it begins to question the very nature of truth reality we understand is something different for each individual an idea that has particular power in the world today anatomy of a fall however isnt necessarily a grand statement about our times triet and her cowriter and partner arthur harari have surely imagined this more as an exploration of domestic conflict than anything else but their observational acuity their fidelity to life as its lived  along with sandra hullers entrancing lead performance  results in something that keeps exploding in the mind long after the credits have rolled it should have been evident long ago that wes andersons brand of hypercontrolled whimsy was all an attempt to confront the unhinged madness of the world and none of us should have been surprised that his work became even more peculiar and more precise as the world became more and more insane maybe thats why asteroid city feels like such a signature work anderson doubles down on his style how is that even possible at this point and gives us a mazelike network of framing devices to tell a story about a group of teenage scientists and their traumatized parents confronting an alien life form in the 1950s or wait is it actually a story about the actors studio and turnofthecentury american theaters attempt to wrestle with the intricacies of the human heart or maybe these are the same thing anderson uses all the technique at his disposal to create a beautiful diorama of a world he cannot understand in the end isnt that what great art does ira sachs is a master of the small delicate gestures that wind up having seismic repercussions in our lives in passages which might be his masterpiece he fashions the most delectably ruinous of love triangles a german filmmaker franz rogowski cheats on his husband ben whishaw with a woman adèle exarchopoulos falls in love with her then begins to have second thoughts as the specter of commitment looms rogowskis character is a total narcissist  a needy callous pathetic selfish chaos agent  but go figure hes also quite irresistible were drawn to this man despite the emotional devastation he wreaks maybe because we sense something of ourselves in him his destructive immaturity is captivating and relatable many of the years best films capture the queasy uncertainty of living in this moment but few do it with such oblique charm as aki kaurismaki in this understated romance following two lonely mismatched souls who keep missing each other kaurismakis style  somehow both deadpan and tender  is timeless and one could argue that his stories could be taking place at any moment in history but look at the ways in which his characters constantly seem on the verge of being tossed aside by the posthuman industrial landscape of helsinki and listen to the way that the music on the radio has been replaced by news reports about the war in ukraine the world has no place for the individual and yet here we still are persisting and yearning and drinking and stewing and fumbling our way through ava duvernay has been so everpresent in the public eye that its wild to think this is her first feature film in five years not to mention her first drama  the genre she truly excels at  in nearly a decade she adapts isabel wilkersons monumental nonfiction study caste as a cross between a historical mystery and a memoir making the writer aunjanue ellistaylor her protagonist thus we see the personal tragedies wilkerson dealt with during her research which adds an emotional urgency to her journey but the films real power lies in duvernays ability to jump across historical events anecdotes and images forging connections that are at times revelatory and devastating creating something that at times feels like both essay film and melodrama nuri bilge ceylans films were never not ambitious but theyve become even more so over the years all the while remaining confined to the rural turkish small towns whose lives the director chronicles so well his latest clocking in at a mesmerizing 197 minutes follows a middle school teacher deniz celiloglu whose attitude toward the people around him  be they students fellow teachers or ordinary citizens  is alternately patronizing compassionate and contemptuous not unlike with passages at times one wonders if this film could have been titled the worst person in the world even as its clear that the filmmaker recognizes much of himself in the protagonist ceylan has never been a directly political filmmaker but about dry grasses provides an astute analysis of the modern turkish intellectuals place in society in all its infuriating complications its social paralysis and selfdefeating selfabsorption wim wenders released two marvelous films this year his 3d documentary anselm was another triumph though it just missed my list and i hope he makes at least a dozen more pictures before hes through but in some ways perfect days represents a culmination of the directors journey wenderss restless angstridden protagonists have always been searching for blissful oblivion these werent ambitious characters but rather people looking for a center all those road movies  where were they headed perfect days provides a kind of answer a quiet middleaged man lives in a modest tokyo home gets up every morning and goes about his day cleaning the citys toilets there are hints of a past heartbreak but theyre nothing more than gentle nods to the fact that all of us come from somewhere theres no sense that this person needs to do more no sense that his life is being wasted if anything he is more aware of how lucky he is to be here than any of us is this what happiness looks like once upon a time michael mann was the king of composed beauty  a director of impeccable frames of telling postures of ethereal moods over the years especially as he began to experiment with digital video his work became more frenetic more abstract more reflective of the cacophony of our manyscreened visual culture in ferrari a project hes been trying to realize for several decades he brings the different sides of his directorial persona together creating a film that veers between classicism in its domestic scenes and riproaring kineticism in its racing scenes its all held together beautifully by adam driver as the aging enzo ferrari and penélope cruz as his wife laura grieving parents and feuding spouses locked in tight emotional combat like a warm blanket made of asbestos alexander paynes comedydrama about winter break at a boys boarding school has a cozy surface familiarity thats slowly revealed to be toxic paul giamatti  an actor who cannot be compared to any other actor in human history in any medium  plays a history teacher living resolutely in the past the stellar davine joy randolph is the grieving head cook who can neither move forward nor look back and lightningbolt newcomer dominic sessa is a troubled unloved teen hurtling headlong into an uncertain future paynes fondness for quiet casual moments blends well with the films lofi aesthetic which mimics the textures of a picture from the 1970s this also means that formally the movie is fixated on the past the way giamattis character is even the nods to the vietnam war throughout play like coy references to a controversial subject as they would have been in 1970 nevertheless growth is possible in paynes work one individuals foibles and failings can open anothers perception his humans lead not by example but through their flaws this is one of the directors greatest films so many biopics tried this year not to be biopics to the point that the films publicists politely but firmly requested that we not call them biopics christopher nolan didnt seem to have any such worries oppenheimer is a proud biopic a dense bigswing condensation of a 600page biography about one of the most important men of the 20th century and about in the movies own words the most important fucking thing to ever happen in the history of the world but oppenheimer is also the opposite of a standardissue great man movie the achievement here is monstrous and the psychic dissolution of the main character before our very eyes is heartbreaking nolan wants to enter j robert oppenheimers mind to see the hidden universe that quantum physics opened up and thus convey the psychic prison in which the scientist found himself after ushering in the nuclear age that the director turned this most devastating of stories into a riveting pop culture phenomenon without ceding one inch on its tragic dimensions is surely an achievement for the ages all of horrors liveliest developments bubbled up from the genres raw edges this year  and more than anything from the internet a24s hit talk to me was the product of two australian youtubers while kyle edward balls skinamarink was born out of creepypasta tropes and liminal spaces videos but its another debut robbie banfitchs foundfootage mojave desert freakout the outwaters thats stubbornly stuck with me for months and i only heard about it because of how much it polarized horror fans online made for a reported 15000 and heavily improvised the outwaters sounds blair witchlike on paper down to the camping trip its group of four friends is taking but the actual experience of watching it is an astonishing array of dreamlike imagery as the trip goes from mundane to macabre a strangers bloody limbs glimpsed by flashlight at night give way to sights that are even more disturbing in the harsh daylight and banfitch who also stars in the film appears at different times to be a victim of whatevers happening and one of its perpetrators he may not be working with much by way of resources but what he accomplishes in this borderline experimental movie knocked my socks off  never more so than the moment when his protagonist somehow finds himself on the wing of a plane like the one he takes home at the start of the film as though hes always been caught in this nightmare and only now sees it james gunn has headed off to the unenviable job of getting another superhero house in order at a corporation thats willing to etherize even his own movie for tax purposes but before he did he demonstrated that hes the best thing that ever happened to the mcu  not that i really needed the reminder as someone whos always been hugely susceptible to his signature mix of the profane the brutal the sentimental and the unexpectedly sublime the decades most dominant genre has calcified into not just a formula but an ongoing advertisement for itself that viewers are expected to be grateful to pay for and in the face of that guardians of the galaxy vol 3 manages to be more than honesttogod entertainment one that has the liberated weirdness of material like a stealth we3 adaptation that was never expected to find a mass audiences it even makes chris pratt likable as it brings starlord full circle from a kid who runs away from grief into the eternal arrested development of a space opera into an adult who finally goes home most of the films that were shot during the pandemic retain some essence of the pandemic whether it has anything to do with whats onscreen or not but this 62minute feature which is enveloping as the lush night in which it takes place somehow doesnt despite being shot in 2020 after filmmaker tyler taormina moved back to his childhood home on long island happers comet feels instead untethered from any particular moment a dialoguefree tribute to the isolation of suburbia that manages to feel as luxurious as it does lonely the film skips through space capturing snapshots rather than trying to assemble anything resembling a story an older woman takes a break from leafing through a flier to lay her head on her dining room table and smile a mechanic staffing an autobody shop with no company except the tinny sound of a radio drops down and starts doing pushups a dog sits in a living room watching an offscreen television taorminas images are as undeniably beautiful as they are eerie  the streetlamps and taillights of a parked car glow with equal warmth on an quiet road  but its the solitude they exude that makes them so inviting as though getting a peek into a million private moments as characters strap on roller skates and go wheeling out into the dark streets it feels unclear if whats motivating them is a desire for company or a chance to revel in the indulgence of all those empty spaces a v rockwells first film has the sweep of a novel and the fiercest of spirits and its anchored by a remarkable performance by teyana taylor as the resolute inez de la paz fresh from rikers in 1994 inez promptly kidnaps her son terry from a neglectful foster situation in brooklyn and spirits him uptown to harlem where she grew up and where shell eventually link up with an ex lucky william catlett in a development that like most of the ones in the film doesnt lead at all where you might expect a thousand and one is a gorgeous moving work about people trying to carve out a family life for themselves with no models to pull from and in the face of a city that becomes increasingly hostile to their existence with every supposed improvement and who fuck up and hurt each other and keep going because the only other option is to give up even while dealing in larger themes rockwell always lets her characters lead the way  they are never anything less than vividly alive as they make their way through a teeming metropolis its all too easy to disappear into theres a formal rigor to playwright tina satters directorial debut that contrasts starkly with the panicky pulsefluttering experience of actually watching it satter took her dialogue verbatim from the transcripts of whistleblower reality winners interrogation by the fbi on june 3 2017 the day of her arrest redactions and all  when the film gets to a line that was blacked out the actors glitch out and briefly vanish from the frame as though their actual performances had been temporarily excised by the state and yet theres nothing removed about sydney sweeneys performance as reality which unfolds in microexpressions as her character tries to pretend  or will herself to believe  that whats happening to her isnt such a big deal as men pour into realitys shitty augusta georgia rental house and start documenting the minutiae of her life the camera closes in on sweeneys increasingly stricken face as though trying to peer into her characters head its a claustrophobic masterful work that in the space of 82 minutes allows you to witness in intimate detail a young womans life getting imploded by the might of the state jonathan glazers film portrays a key figure in the holocaust not as the embodiment of virulent hatred but as a product of compartmentalization and ambition which turns out to be even more disturbing im not sure there is a viewing experience this year that is simultaneously as stunning and stifling as the zone of interest which subjects you to the bourgeois aspirations and careerist angst of rudolf christian friedel and hedwig höss sandra hüller whove achieved their dream home right next to the death camp at auschwitz which rudolf oversees the austerity of glazers approach is unforgiving presenting the mundanity of the hösss concerns from hedwigs pride in her garden to the transfer rudolf is given that hedwig refuses to accompany him during against an alwayspresentbutneverpeeredinto backdrop of atrocity the horror next door only occasionally manages to intrude into carefully partitionedoff consciousnesses of the family as when a swimming trip with the children is cut short by an encounter with some of the gruesome byproducts of the camp but in a late scene that connects his film to joshua oppenheimers crucial documentary the act of killing glazer posits that sometimes the body can revolt against the brutal truths the mind tries to tamp down leave it to hayao miyazaki to pack so much mourning selfdoubt resentment and hope into a movie about a secret kingdom filled with winsome ravenous anthropomorphic birds theres more to the boy and the heron than that of course including a backdrop of world war ii japan autobiographical resonances a pregnant stepmother whos also an aunt a gray heron whos also a grouchy man and the dream logic of the oceandominated otherworld where souls rise up as adorable spirits to be born into our reality but whats so compelling about miyazakis epic latest which will hopefully also not be his last is the way that the magical serves as an emotional allegory for what 12yearold mahito soma santoki is going through rather than something literal mahitos wizardlike granduncle retreated from reality to create a beguiling but unsteady alternate universe that he needs someone free of malice to take over the boy and the heron is about accepting loss but also accepting that you are part of the world in all its brokenness and all its potential lila aviléss dazzling family drama takes place over a single day during which the relatives of a 7yearold girl named sol naíma sentíes gather at her grandfathers house to throw a surprise birthday party for her father tona mateo garcía elizondo that tona is likely to die soon from the cancer thats reduced him to a husk is clear to everyone except tótems young protagonist who struggles to understand why her dad doesnt always want to see her or anyone and tries to make sense of the behavior of the griefstricken grownups around her aviléss film combines the avid curiosity of a child with the steady wisdom of an adult and as it whirls through party prep and the bickering of family members  over a cake over the bathroom over tonas decision to forgo treatment over a spiritualist brought in to cleanse the home  it approaches its large ensemble of characters with a tenderness thats almost unbearable without ever verging on cloying its a film about death that becomes a heartfelt celebration of life todd hayness latest is a brilliant ode to female toxicity that begins at a place of camp and ends at one thats closer to horror the mary kay letourneauinspired gracie athertonyoo julianne moore lisps and

joe yoo charles melton who she later married while barely concealing her ravenous glee at the ripeness of the material shes harvesting haynes showcases these dueling characters and the outsize performances behind them with an appreciative wryness thats deceptive as moore opens the fridge the score lets loose with a dramatic twang before she observes i dont think we have enough hot dogs its joe who emerges as the films wounded soul played by an impressive melton as a 30something man frozen somewhere in adolescence by his experiences blinking in disbelief at the life hes found himself in as though just waking up to the reality of what happened to him its a heartbreaking turn and the way its deployed onscreen makes may december the years most complex and layered watch this year has given me a lot of the old world is dying and the new world struggles to be born feelings about the movies between the contraction of the streaming model which maybe never made sense to begin with in terms of profitability the floundering of disney the faltering of oncemassive franchises the triumphant labor movements and the incursion of pop stars into the multiplexes im hardly mourning the corporate structures that have dominated the last decade plus but i have no idea what comes next i just know that theres been no better movie to encapsulate the year and no better movie period than kelly reichardts matchless showing up which is all about making art in a world that also requires you to make money as lizzy a sculptor and admin assistant at a real arts college that a little too fittingly went under a few years ago for financial reasons michelle williams has the perfectly pinched aura of a bluestocking dropped in sundappled presentday portland but her concerns  her ability to make her delicate clay sculptures of little ladies while also balancing a day job the enviable selfinterest of her frenemyrival artistlandlord jo a delightful hong chau  are palpable enough to feel like they could belong to reichardt herself the pressing intertwined with the petty in ways that are deeply relatable is it possible to support yourself and still have enough left over to do the work you love showing up which also features a turn from passion project flautist andré benjamin doesnt have an answer what it does have is an inexpressibly lovely affirmation of the meaning of making art that you believe in even if it only reaches a select but appreciative audience good job girls this year saw several major superhero movies go bust and as of this writing we dont know if aquaman will be another one it saw disney deliver one bona fide animated flop wish and another that exists in the liminal space between flop and hit elemental we also saw netflix starting to pull back on the mountains of money it throws toward film productions many of us have been anticipating maybe even hoping for the end of the franchise era but now that it might be happening what lies on the other side throughout 2023 our critics maintained best movies of the year so far lists some of those selections appear above in our top 10 picks below are more of the films but not all that stood out to them this year lowbudget action master jessie v johnson directed this downanddirty period slaughterfest about a woman who becomes a powerful warrior after her husband the leader of the iceni is killed by the romans as the title character a legendary figure in ancient british history the great olga kurylenko convincingly goes from meek tender and deferential to mad snarling and murderous dont expect much historical analysis or period accuracy or emotional nuance this one works on your lizard brain its like a dimestore braveheart it might not have the sweep of those oldschool period action films but its still thrilling and passionate and filled with bloodcurdling walltowall violence be kaouther ben hanias hybrid documentary has a remarkable conceit telling the story of olfa hamrouni a tunisian mother and her four daughters by restaging scenes from their eventful terrifying lives two of the girls play themselves the other two are played by actresses because as olfa says they were devoured by the wolves what she actually means by that becomes clear over the course of the film though tunisians who remember this news item from recent history may know where the story goes as we learn about olfas marriage the abuse in her family and how her daughters gradually embraced a form of militant fundamentalist islam that tore their family apart an actress is hired to play olfa during the more difficult scenes and we see dryly funny and slyly terrifying footage of the real olfa coaching her double how to act in telling the story of olfa and her daughters ben hania whose 2019 film the man who sold his skin was nominated for an oscar is also telling the tumultuous story of tunisia in the wake of the arab spring a promising movement that began in that country before spreading to the rest of north africa and the middle east be it would be tempting to say that killers of the flower moon is martin scorseses attempt at a western and one could also see in it yet another gangster epic from a man whos made his share of them but in adapting david granns acclaimed 2017 nonfiction history about a yearslong conspiracy to murder members of the osage nation in an effort to accrue their oil wealth scorsese and screenwriter eric roth have turned it into that simplest and slipperiest of things the story of a marriage the film is at its best when showing the growing relationship between mollie brown lily gladstone a member of a large and wealthy osage family and ernest burkhart leonardo dicaprio a wwi veteran who arrives in town to work for his uncle william hale robert de niro a local godfather type the most uncomfortable aspect of killers of the flower moon is not the spectacular criminality on display but rather how its treated by so many of the characters as no big deal these are typically scorsesean ideas our offhand capacity for evil the inherent violence of relationships the strain of serving two masters in so many ways though this is lily gladstones movie she plays mollie with a mix of standoffishness and exhausted hope as the horrors mount around her she navigates her queasy gathering suspicions as well as her affection for her husband when he tells mollie he loves her she believes him and so do we that is in many ways the great cruel unreconciled tragedy at the heart of this tale be argentine director rodrigo morenos film is being billed as a heist movie which is not technically incorrect it is in fact about a man who robs a bank and then coaxes a coworker into an elaborate scheme to get away with it but at heart the delinquents is about leaving an oppressive world behind and discovering the possibility of freedom in a new one the thieves here are not looking to get rich three and a half years in jail or 25 at the bank is how morán daniel elias puts it to his colleague román esteban bigliardi explaining why hes resorted to crime the plan is quite simple morán will confess to the robbery and get three years in prison román will hide the money in the meantime afterward the two men will have just enough to not have to work for a living but is such a goal such a world even possible morenos film is really about the wait in between about what happens as these two men bide their time clocking in at 183 minutes this is a movie of detours both narrative and formal but its never boring or tedious the delinquents works its magic on us the way that the promise of freedom works on its characters its a vision of a life unlived  as impossible as it is intoxicating be this brutal argentine horror film takes place in a reality in which possessions are both known and spreadable transforming the infected into malevolent oozing masses of flesh that are referred to as rottens but what makes demián rugnas film so effective is not the gore which is appropriately gross or the idea of a demonic contagion  its the way that the weaknesses of human nature on both a personal and a systemic level make stopping the corruption almost impossible once it appears when a rotten turns up on land near the farm owned by brothers pedro ezequiel rodríguez and jaime demián salomon the local authorities pass the buck while insisting that everyone is overreacting but pedro the closest thing the film has to a hero is anything but he ends up doing more damage in his flailing efforts to help and to save his children a sequence that plays like a grim comedy of errors rugna was apparently inspired by health issues caused by pesticide in his native country though the films combination of misinformation denial and institutional failures invariably brings to mind the early days of covid aw the artificialintelligence framing is just bait  the robots in this scifi epic dont actually have much bearing on our current conversations about chatgpt they are instead multifaceted metaphors for all sorts of groups that get othered and the focus of gareth edwardss unexpectedly grownup movie is less the ais themselves than how theyre treated by the american forces that are battling to wipe them from existence the creator riffs on both vietnam war movies and blade runner as it sends a neverbetter john david washington into a wartorn southeast asia to look for the woman gemma chan he loved and betrayed never seeming sure as to what he would say if he found her edwards always good with visual effects offers up stunning livedin landscapes in which brutalist metal towers coexist alongside paddy fields and villages aw documentarian claire simon explains what shes setting out to do at the start of the astonishing our body  to explore the mostly female world of the womens health ward of a parisian hospital treating the gynecological pathologies that weigh down on our lives on our loves on our hopes on our desires over the course of her almost threehour film she turns her camera to moments of vulnerability sorrow and joy as a woman records the voice of her crying newborn after giving birth alone as a trans teenager learns hell have to wait until hes 18 to go ahead with medical procedures his father refuses to consent to and as a young woman weeps while talking about the pain shes started experiencing during sex with her new husband theres an expansive generosity to the film and to the willingness of its subjects to allow these moments to be documented thats met with the same openness from simon when a diagnosis means that shes no longer just the director but a patient herself aw sebastien marniers slowboiling thriller weaves such a mood of sinister duplicity that you might want to take a shower afterward it follows stephane laure calamy a cannery worker with a girlfriend in prison who reconnects with serge jacques weber the wealthy businessman she claims is her father serges family is immediately suspicious but its clear theyve got their own designs on the mans wealth everybody in this movie seems to be lying through their teeth in less sure hands this could have resulted in annoyance but marnier and his terrific cast know just how much to reveal and when they keep us delightfully unmoored be kenneth branaghs hercule poirot mysteries havent exactly set the film world on fire so the fact that the directorstar continues to make them clearly speaks to his love for these stories and this character in the latest a haunting in venice he forsakes the swooping cameras and epic vistas and frantic pacing of the previous films for something stranger more insular and maybe even more refined he takes agatha christies littlediscussed 1969 novel halloween party and turns it into a moody staccato thriller about the unknown he also takes quite a few liberties with the original along the way transporting the story to venice in 1947 and bringing in a supernatural undercurrent this allows for some jumpscares but it also makes poirot more intriguing his refusal to believe in matters of the spirit isnt just due to his devotion to science and reason  its also a measure of his brokenness be pablo larraíns latest film presents general augusto pinochet the brutal usbacked military dictator who ruled chile from 1973 to 1990 and died in 2006 still with the blood of thousands on his hands as a literal vampire so what is it horror satire allegory political thriller family drama its got all these elements in it but its also very much its own thing  an elegantly shot film whose competing tones create something delirious and new but beneath all the genre theatrics what comes through most vividly in el conde are larraíns sadness and rage at what happened to his country be if anything emma seligmans followup to shiva baby could be even more anarchic but as is its a blissfully silly unabashedly violent and often daring time rachel sennott and ayo edebiri are a comedy duo for the ages as pj and josie lesbian outcasts who found a womens selfdefense classfight club at their high school and accidentally create a space for feminist solidarity though the two of them are just trying to get laid both are very funny and the cast features other standouts too  like marshawn lynch as the clubs soontobedivorced adviser and kaia gerber as the schools secondmostpopular cheerleader aw in rodrigo sorogoyens absorbing suspenseful drama a french couple attempt to start an organic farm and rehabilitate a desolate stretch of property in a rural spanish village but the locals who are trying to sell their land off for development by a windenergy company see the couple as stuckup foreigners trying to prevent them from making money and leaving this place sorogoyen might give lip service to the economic realities underlying the land dispute but hes also not afraid to take sides and to entertain as the growing hostility between the man and woman and their neighbors eventually reaches straw dogsesque proportions it becomes clear the director wants to make us feel his protagonists growing helplessness and the gnawing tension of living right next door to people who might genuinely want to kill you be directed and cowritten by greta gerwig barbie has become a rorschachinkblot purity test about feminism womanhood and the state of the industry itself is barbie feminist or is it merely a marker of capitalisms cunning taking the emblems but not of the soul of the feminist movement is it just a slick toy commercial or is it actually reckoning with the cultural weight of barbie with wit i think the truth is rather complex making barbie operate as a womans picture a feminist argument and film defined by its delirious interest in the pleasure principle no matter where youve drawn your lines on this cultural battlefield its hard to deny that barbie is fun as hell led by starproducer margot robbie barbie is a pink funhouse brimming with glittering dance numbers heartfelt monologues and a genuine curiosity about not just womanhood but humanity itself everyone in the cast brings their agame ryan gosling undoubtedly has the boldest performance as the yearning himbo ken whose entire existence is in service of basking in barbies warm gaze issa rae and hari nef are equal delights for some deranged line readings alone america ferrera is the stealth mvp for her juicy monologue that extols the constrictions on women robbie cements her position as a true new star in hollywoods firmament by helping craft a film that has a capacious curiosity and joyful aesthetics that speak toward the wild yearning nature of being alive ajb juel taylors genrebending directorial debut is a vibrant snappy melding of scifi concepts social commentary and blaxploitation homage with john boyega jamie foxx and teyonah parris starring as broadly drawn types  a drug dealer a pimp and a sex worker  who discover that the seemingly inescapable patterns of their lives in a neighborhood called the glen arent accidental and are actually the result of a government conspiracy with so many netflix original movies these days feeling like algorithmic filler they cloned tyrone is the rare offering that doesnt just feel like its made by a person but by someone with an eye for visual a distinctive voice and a sharp sense of humor aw forest fires rage in the distance in christian petzolds entrancing film which doesnt stop its characters  novelist leon thomas schubert photographer felix langston uibel seasonal worker nadja paula beer and rescue swimmer devid enno trebs  from flirting and fighting over shared meals outside the beach house thats afires primary setting throughout the film its leons tetchiness over the failings of his second manuscript that threaten to derail the seaside idyll but the potential for more serious danger always lurks in the background the wonder of petzolds work is that it revels in the unblemished youthfulness of its characters while allowing that in order to make great art it helps to have endured some pain aw freediving  trying to reach record depths by simply holding your breath and diving as far as you can  is one of the deadliest sports on the face of the earth and laura mcganns documentary has quite a challenge how to tell its story without feeling like its exploiting a potential tragedy the film opens with champion italian diver alessia zecchini blacking out at the end of one of her dives then flashes back across the years to show her love for the sport and her rise to the top all the while interweaving the story of stephen keenan an irish free diver who eventually became an expert safety diver and coach those familiar with the story will know where its all headed others  that would be most viewers probably  will wonder how these two lives will ultimately intersect documentary purists who balk at movies hiding reallife tragedies from their viewers until the end will probably break out in hives but mcgann doesnt really hide the nature of her story its clear pretty early on that were watching something harrowing this is ultimately an elegant and deeply moving picture be the latest mission impossible movie as suggested by that ominous part one seems to care a bit more about its plot than previous entries and its not hard to see why this time tom cruises ethan hunt isnt fighting nihilistic terrorists or vaporous internationalespionage networks but an allpowerful artificial intelligence known as the entity a variation on the manversusmachine theme that cruise pursued in last years top gun maverick its also a rather compelling metaphor for the actors wellpublicized dedication to oldschool action filmmaking and reallife stunt work but if dead reckoning spends a bit too much time slowly and repeatedly spelling out what the entity is and what it can do and why thats capitalb bad it can be forgiven because all that exposition serves as a kind of spiritual justification for the bravado on display and the film is filled with amazing action set pieces including the stars muchpublicized deathdefying motorcycleparachute jump over  or rather into  an immense norwegian canyon as well as the most hairraising train derailment ever put to film whenever it gets down to the business of making tom cruise run and jump and drive and fly in and out of things dead reckoning manages to astonish be read bilge ebiris full review of mission impossible  dead reckoning part one and jason baileys ranking of the best action sequences in the entire mi franchise despite the spectacle of an effectively deaged harrison ford walloping nazis atop a train during world war ii in its opening scenes james mangolds film isnt about the young indiana jones but about the aging and rather pathetic dr henry jones now on the verge of retirement from teaching archaeology to sleepy hunter college students drinking himself silly in a grubby new york apartment into his life enters his goddaughter helena shaw phoebe wallerbridge the adventurous offspring of an old colleague to drag him along on a chase for a contraption that can predict fissures in the very fabric of time thereby allowing travel into the past not unlike the force awakens did with the original star wars dial of destiny feels at times like a remix offering variations on elements from earlier indiana jones movies mangold may not have the young steven spielbergs musical flair for extravagant action choreography who does but he is a tougher leaner director using a tighter frame and keeping his camera close that may shortchange the escapist atmosphere and evocative exotica of the material but it does bring a groundlevel immediacy to the action plus all the vehicular mayhem probably suits this older slower version of indy who fights less but often finds himself in the middle of any number of wouldnt it be cool if chases motorcycles and tuktuks and trains and jaguars and horses and planes in all manner of arrangements and rearrangements as well as one delirious final sequence that had me giggling with delight no its not raiders of the lost ark no movie is but its too entertaining to dismiss be pietro marcellos previous feature 2020s brilliant martin eden was an ambitious adaptation that attempted to graft a jack london novel onto the entire history of the 20th century with scarlet he works in a gentler register though the ambition is still there in its opening scenes a gruff quiet man raphaël raphaël thiéry returns from world war i to discover that his wife is dead and that he has a young daughter he and the girl live with a group of women who are outcasts from the community and he soon becomes an outcast as well this rough mans daughter played as a young woman by juliette jouan turns out to be the most delicate of creatures a romantic young woman with a connection to the divine this beguiling film has the cadences of a fairy tale  prophetic visions magical coincidences behavior echoed across the years  but marcello who came up through the documentary world expertly blends the immediate and the airy be georgia oakleys feature debut is an anguished look at life in the closet set in northeast england in 1988  the year the thatcher administration introduced a set of laws banning the promotion of homosexuality in the name of protecting children jean played by a terrific rosy mcewen in her first leading role has painstakingly compartmentalized her existence at night she hangs out at a lesbian bar with her girlfriend viv kerrie hayes a part of herself she keeps secret from her coworkers and students at the school where she works as a gym teacher in the day blue jean is a moody delicately wrought film about how jean damaged from past experiences and her own internalized homophobia is unable to feel like she belongs in either of the worlds she created for herself the justification for the impending legislation in the background of the film may sound all too familiar but blue jeans real power comes from its examination of the human costs of living in fear aw not to be corny but i teared up a few times during the opening scenes of this sequel to 2018s into the spiderverse just from how good it all looked somehow the animation is even more impressive and imaginative as the film gives us new universes done in soft watercolors and futuristic detail while also returning us to the embrace of the vibrant comicbookartinspired brooklyn that its teenage hero miles morales shameik moore inhabits across the spiderverse ends on a tobecontinued but its hard to complain about that when its so rich with detail and so beautifully crafted  a riff on multiverse storytelling that also becomes a heartfelt exploration of parenting and accepting that growing up means that your child is going to encounter pain you cant shelter them from aw based on a reallife case dominik molls thriller follows the lengthy investigation into the grisly burning death of a young woman in a small town near grenoble an opening title informs us that this was but one of many unsolved murders in france a disquieting bit of information with which to kick off a mystery telling us there wont be a final solution to the case this subtly draws our attention to other aspects of the story to the interactions among the cops investigating the case to the humdrum bureaucracy of police work and to a general feeling of haunted desolation in this provincial area nestled next to the french alps the film won six awards at this years césar awards including best picture director and screenplay but there seems to be very little buzz around its us release even so it feels major with an unsettling mood that recalls such previous policier masterpieces as david finchers zodiac and bong joon hos memories of murder its realworld mysteries eventually become existential ones but the movie never stops sending chills up your spine be as the ultracorporate shark jim balsillie glenn howerton is a nearcomical vision of drive and animalistic ambition and his character turns out to be just who the clumsy introverted nerds who founded research in motion rim the tiny company that would transform the cellphone industry need to make their harebrained schemes reality directed by matt johnson blackberry basically presents the rise of the smartphone as a sitcom pitch what happens when two affable notreadyforprimetime dorks from waterloo canada  brilliant engineer mike lazaridis jay baruchel and his cando cheerleader pal doug fregin johnson  are joined by a crisply suited harvardeducated phonesmashing apex predator one of the great pleasures of blackberry is watching balsillies befuddled running disgust at lazaridis and fregins hapless ways at the chaotic ineptitude of their finances their utter lack of business sense and their goalongtogetalong management style i would happily watch several seasons of these three going at it be this is a largely wordless world war ii thriller about a grizzled haunted loner who strikes a massive vein of gold in the remote reaches of lapland only to find himself tormented by a platoon of retreating nazis the year is 1944 and the war is basically lost for the germans who are laying waste to everything in their path as the nazis chase him our hero picks them off sometimes individually and sometimes en masse what keeps it from being repetitive and predictable is director jalmari helanders increasingly creative ideas about how his hero should go about wasting the nazis in his path as the film graduates from humble head stabbings and limb snappings to more ambitious and explosive mayhem so much so that it all starts to border on a philosophical treatise about survival and perseverance some will say sisu recalls mad max fury road or inglourious basterds but i kept imagining it as what might have happened had sergio leone been alive to direct crank high voltage be like the characters in brokeback mountain the men in this drama from felix van groeningen and charlotte vandermeersch bond during an edenic summer in the wilderness and while their relationship is platonic the film is no less a love story pietro luca marinelli and bruno alessandro borghi are childhood friends who reunite as adults to build a cabin up in the mountains where bruno grew up and pietros family used to spend the summers  a breathtaking location that becomes a place the two return to as the years pass the eight mountains offers all sorts of ecstatically beautiful footage of the italian alps but it also spins out a delicate rueful story about trying to find a balance between nature and work as its two characters take divergent routes in their search for a meaningful life aw the comedy troupe broken lizard met at colgate back in 1989 and never spiritually left college thank god for that their work still feels like a group of amiable stoners from across the hall came up with a bunch of dumb funny ideas to put into a movie and then filmed it all the following morning a riff on the hunchback of notre dame quasi may be their first period piece but its basically the same vibesbased silliness steve lemme plays quasimodo a torturechamber employee who gets caught in a petty but murderous tiff between the pope and the king one can easily imagine a version of this movie where the plot is handled with urgency authenticity and suspense but then what would you be left with the broken lizard guys understand that their brand of handmade goodnatured humor doesnt really work with tighter storytelling or sharper acting and theyve honed their approach well over the years theyre always winking at us because they know theirs is a fundamentally participatory style of comedy the process is part of the joke they keep making cult movies so that when you watch them you feel as if you were there when they made them broken lizard is all of us be makoto shinkais latest is another of the openhearted romantic fantasies hes so good at a roadtrip adventure about an orphaned teenage girl who helps save japan from a mythical worm whose intrusions into our world cause massive earthquakes but despite featuring both a mysterious love interest and a talking cat suzume is a more pensive affair than it first appears one that reflects what it means to come of age when the future feels so uncertain suzume nanoka hara and her companion souta hokuto matsumura  a dreamboat who hilariously spends most of his time magically transformed into a threelegged chair  cross the country trying to close up portals that open in areas that have been abandoned because of disasters or the shrinking population as though patching up the tears in a social fabric thats wearing thin all over its a swoony gorgeously animated movie that earns its sadness as well as its ecstatic bursts of hope aw its possible that no scene this year will be more entertaining than the one in which signe kristine kujath thorp a norwegian woman with a pathological need to be the center of attention lies to the chef at a fancy dinner about having severe nut allergies then forgets she said that and eats something with nuts while the whole table looks on in horrified expectation but then all of this kristoffer borgli movie is like that  a bitterly funny black comedy about narcissism and the paths people attempt to take to fame when signes boyfriend thomas eirik sæther rises thanks to a dubious artistic career involving stolen furniture signe retaliates by taking a recalled russian drug whose side effects include a horrifying skin condition the perfectly paired sociopaths ricochet through oslo as though each is involved in their own elaborate stunt that never actually ends aw air ben afflecks enormously entertaining corporate drama about nikes efforts to sign michael jordan might seem at first like a ridiculous idea for a movie but it is in fact an ingenious one the creation of the air jordan sneaker changed pop culture forever and jordans unprecedented profitsharing deal with nike would give athletes equity in the products they were being used to sell the film situates the air jordan as a product of the runaway consumerism of the 1980s but it also hints at a boundless complex new world coming into view in what will surely go down in history as one of the great sportsmovie speeches sonny vaccaro matt damon the executive in charge of the shoe companys basketball outreach makes the point to michael himself that the player practically exists outside of space and time everyone at this table will be forgotten he says noting all the executives gathered around them except for you be in attempting to turn the classic fantasy roleplaying game into a franchise picture directors john francis daley and jonathan goldstein somehow manage to play to the base while acknowledging the inherent ridiculousness and impenetrability of the concept their film is filled with medieval derringdo unpronounceable fantasyspeak and what i can only assume is a cornucopia of nerdtastic easter eggs but its also hilarious with a game cast led by chris pine a leading man who has turned making fun of his own leading manness into an art form the films set pieces are built around comedy with bits of cleverly choreographed and directed action to add some urgency not the other way around and the humor actually helps to up the suspense honor among thieves is the work of filmmakers who understand that the best way to take stuff like this seriously is not to take it seriously at all and to have fun with it be john wick chapter 4 is blissfully entertaining full of pratfalls and acting turns that make audiences swell with oohs aahs and yelps its far more narratively focused than its previous sequels while still managing to globetrot a behemoth cast à la chapter 2 and chapter 3 here john wick keanu reeves seeks to finally buy his freedom by dueling the marquis bill skarsgård i have some reservations about the narrative choices but the cinematic violence of chapter 4 brought me the joy and erotic rush that has long powered the series it synthesizes the zaniness of looney tunes and gags of buster keaton with martialarts master classes that call back to the career of jackie chan and learn from more recent films like 2017s south korean action flick the villainess its a history lesson on what the body can do onscreen  its limits and its wonders ajb read angelica jade bastiéns review of john wick chapter 4 chris lees interview with filmmaker chad stahelski and bilge ebiris analysis of the movies ending this is the lightly fictionalized and amazing story of amateur historian philippa langley sally hawkins who in 2012 helped lead an archaeological expedition that dug up a nondescript leicester car park and unearthed the remains of the notorious king richard iii the bulk of the film tells of how philippa came to be fascinated by the disgraced medieval monarch and fought not just to find his grave but also to counter the prevailing villainous narrative about him which may well have been the work of tudor propagandists theres an interesting tension in the film between the exaltation of royal power on the one hand  a spiritual belief in the magic of lineage itself dating back to arcane notions of divine right  and on the other the ennobling of common individuals of ordinary people like philippa as they butt heads with city councils and university administrators and academic mossbacks the very act of reclaiming richards legacy from his nowgone tudor rivals puts the lie to the very idea of royalty of bloodlines and the eternal question of who gets to have power over whom be the latest from awardwinning veteran belgian realists jeanpierre and luc dardenne follows two african migrants in belgium 17yearold lokita joely mbundu and her 11yearold brother tori pablo schils theyre not actually siblings theyre not even from the same country but theyve formed an almost mystically strong bond ever since they met during their crossing to europe and have now become inseparable for all the sensitivity and sobriety of their work what has made the dardennes such effective filmmakers has been the subtle way they insert genre elements into their dramas each movie could be thought of as a thriller  often involving characters racing against the clock entering places they mustnt or crossing people they shouldnt this one is no different tori and lokita work for pennies at an italian restaurant singing songs for the customers then dealing drugs all over the city for the joints owner so they can make money to send to lokitas family back home and to the smugglers that brought them here these two kids are surrounded by cruelty indifference and suspicion but their relationship also allows us to feel some hope it also means that the film becomes ulcerinducingly unbearable once things truly start to spin out of control be this cleverly constructed comedy from hong sangsoo takes place entirely in a small seoul apartment building that provides not just the setting for the movie but its structure byungsoo haehyo kwon is an acclaimed filmmaker paying a visit to the buildings owner an old friend named ms kim lee hyeyoung who soon realizes he has ulterior motives but what follows are sly episodes that take byungsoo to each level of the building in what can be seen as glimpses of his future romantic and professional disappointments or as forwardlooking fantasies about his life as he gradually loses the status thats key to his identity aw the romantic comedy isnt dead its strolling around south london in the company of dom david jonsson and yas vivian oparah a pair of charming 20somethings who end up spending the day together after a less than auspicious meet cute in the bathroom of an art gallery both are getting over breakups and the joy of raine allenmillers movie comes from the dawning realization in each over teasing banter and some miniadventures along the way that they might finally be ready to open their hearts again aw ji huang and ryûji otsukas bleakly funny film has you aching for its 20yearold protagonist lynn honggui yao as much as you also feel exasperated with her naïveté lynn whos studying to be a flight attendant seems forever a passenger in her own life but when she finds out shes pregnant by her selfinvolved boyfriend she opts to keep the baby in a scheme to help her mother one of the few firm decisions we see her make in stonewallings vision of a contemporary china accelerating toward dystopia this shifts lynn from being commodified for her beauty to being commodified for the fetus shes carrying navigating an increasingly absurd fertility industry that suggests her future prospects are bleak aw guy ritchie movies should theoretically be romps but an overbearing fussiness threatens to kneecap many of them at every turn here then is something genuinely charming and lightfooted an espionage comedythriller in which a british superspy jason statham with a fondness for the finer things in life puts together a team to infiltrate the world of a playboy billionaire arms dealer hugh grant who just happens to be obsessed with the work of an actionmovie star josh hartnett who in turn also gets roped into the elaborate scheme with plenty of action set pieces  shootouts car chases and acrobatic beatdowns  you could imagine this as a dry run for a james bond film but the humorous banter and the cast with especially charming turns from hartnett and grant place it firmly in the realm of comedy everybody in operation fortune  yes even guy ritchie  seems to be having fun sometimes thats all you need be cocaine bear is above all else a title and a concept and the movie clearly understands this elizabeth bankss actioncomedythriller is loosely based on a 1985 incident when an american black bear ingested a massive amount of cocaine and was found dead soon thereafter the film concocts a fanciful story  a series of stories really  out of what might happen if an enormous bear went on a savage indestructible cokefueled rampage through the georgia woods its part spielbergian kids adventure part slasher flick with an ambling gory insouciance that might have been more offputting in a movie not called cocaine bear be colin wests gentle scifi comedydrama plays like interstellar remade by wes anderson jim gaffigan gives a warm charming performance as the host of

kid at school who just happens to be the troubled son of the hardass gogetter astronaut who replaced our hero at his job also played by gaffigan now with a sinister mustache but as the characters realities begin to fray we start to sense that theres more to this story than what were seeing its a moving film about time ambition aging wormholes and the allconsuming power of love and the films

young girl and her two fathers jonathan groff and ben aldridge  with an impossible choice they must willingly sacrifice one member in order to avert the apocalypse the film smoothly moves from the textures of one type of thriller to another even as the mood remains eerily consistent a frankenstein opening soon gives way to a homeinvasion picture then a villagecult horror movie and finally a disaster flick knock at the cabin is based on paul tremblays 2018 novel the cabin at the end of the world and the script follows the book pretty closely for the first twothirds both are works of the apocalyptic imagination but tremblays tale is more insular working the ambiguity of the situation to explore the characters faith and emotional perseverance shyamalan however understands that there is usually little ambiguity around such horrors in cinema in 2023 when someone in a movie says the planet is ending it usually is instead he returns to one of the animating ideas of his early work a

Dec 3 2023,positive, now available to rent and buy both online and on physical media christopher nolans oppenheimer is an impressive but flawed biographical picture while nolan brings the full weight of his filmmaking talent to bear on the film it is actually the performances that stand out the most oppenheimer uses a nonlinear somewhat messy narrative to follow physicist j robert oppenheimer cillian murphy from his university studies in 1926 europe through his masterminding the atomic bomb during world war ii and to its politically fraught aftermath in the 1950s it tells his story with a large ensemble cast it would be a nightmare remembering every characters name but thankfully nolans screenplay ensures you do not need to remember every famous physicist in order to follow the story what does make things needlessly complicated is nolans constant shifting back and fourth between three separate timelines while the bulk of the film follows oppenheimers career during the war another presents a rather harrowing interrogation of oppenheimer in the 1950s a third presented in stark black and white a first for the imax film format follows a senate confirmation for cabinet hopeful lewis strauss robert downey jr the use of black and white is a bold but distracting choice and a lack of clarity in the films initial scenes makes it a slightly muddled ride for the first 45 minutes or so when the action settles down the narrative becomes clearer and there is certainly a strong emotional payoff by the climax no matter the thread or timeline oppenheimer is a film haunted by the spectre of nuclear weapons oppenheimer himself is increasingly haunted by the potential for destruction and abstract imagery peppers the most intense scenes with glimpses of atoms splitting and fire raging so pervasive is the sense of dread that it powerfully undercuts any sense of achievement when the iconic trinity test succeeds the gathered scientists and soldiers clap and cheer enthusiastically yet the scene retains the miserable gutpunch of tragedy its not a surprise to note nolan is 53 years old oppenheimers treatment of the atomic bomb blazes with generation x expectations of nuclear annihilations nowadays our expectations of armageddon feel more closely tied to climate change or viral outbreaks if you were not there in the early 1980s you simply do not know what it felt like nolan captures it perfectly it is great to see cillian murphy not only get his highestprofile lead role to date but to see him play it with such complexity there is an ambivalence to murphys gaze and he employs it powerfully here he is surrounded by a broad ensemble of hugely talented artists including matt damon josh hartnett kenneth branagh florence pugh and david dastmalchian among them there are three key highlights it is wonderful to see robert downey jr fully stretch his acting talents as strauss a role miles away from the iron man films that dominated much of the past 15 years another unexpectedly strong performance comes from jason clarke terminator genisys pet sematary who captures the screen as an aggressive government prosecutor finally emily blunt does wonders in a somewhat limited role as oppenheimers resentful wife kitty it is hard not to notice how much oppenheimer limits and sidelines its female characters it is partly a problem of history make a film about a group of men building an atomic bomb and it is going to be dominated by male characters on the other hand including kitty oppenheimer opens the film to a womans perspective on the historical events nolan entertains the potential to some degree but could easily have pushed much further the situation is even worse for costar florence pugh who plays j roberts lover jean tatlock  she appears terribly superficial in a role that wastes her talents christopher nolan continues to have a blind spot for women in his films all too often they are underwritten they exist as either victims rachel dawes in the dark knight damsels kat barton in tenet or as emotional support for the male protagonist ellie burr in insomnia sarah borden in the prestige i am sure many would argue that the facts of history precluded nolan from foregrounding any women here this ignores the fact that he gives himself the perfect setup already  and simply fails to follow through with it despite its flaws oppenheimer is a powerful visually impressive film ludwig göranssons musical score is masterful as is nolans use of sound stamping feet never felt so powerful or so ominous
Dec 3 2023,negative, in typical christopher nolan dunkirk inception style oppenheimer fizzes with quick cuts multiple timelines and aesthetic flourishes accompanied by immersive sound effects but just because theres a lot happening on screen with a tense soundtrack playing for three hours straight it doesnt mean a movie will be interesting  the film suffers from a lack of editing and the topic about the excesses of hubris feels like deeply trodden territory aside from an impressive showcase for cillian murphy as the titular physicist and father of the atom bomb oppenheimer amounts to more the same navelgazing found in nolans previous film tenet 2020more flash than substance nolan does women dirty in oppenheimer florence pugh plays oppenheimers mistress jean tatlock and spends much of her screen time naked and hypersexualized before she kills herself so that the narrative can give the physicist a scene where he gets to feel bad emily blunt gets shoved into a tokenized box as a shrewlike wife shown mostly crying yelling throwing things andor all of the above although she gets a single grrl power scene dressing down a table full of men its overall a demeaning role for an actor whos so much more than this script allows her to be i was uncomfortable watching yet another film about tortured white male genius when the victims of the atrocitiesjapanese people and native americanswere glossed over by the script and had no voice at most white characters quip about the indians on whose burial grounds the manhattan project blithely bombs to all hell in other scenes discussions about japanese casualties are purposefully cold taking place behind closed doors in rooms full of white men who discuss the mass murder of hundreds of thousands of civilians like theyre talking about the weather  the film has jewish main characters robert j oppenheimer and lewis strauss robert downey jr but the story is told by nonjewish filmmaker nolan and based on a book by kai bird and martin sherwinneither of whom are jewish though bird is married to a jewish woman  among lead actors downey jr has jewish heritage but murphy and the actor who plays iconic jewish physicist albert einstein tom conti are not at most jewish actors like alden ehrenreich david krumholtz benny safdie and others appear in the film but they play supporting and minor roles in a very large cast all this to say there isnt anything inherently wrong with actors playing roles outside of their own faiths it just doesnt make this film a positive example of jewish representation simply because there isnt much to speak of 
Dec 2 2023,negative, a movie that might have been otherwise titled fatman the dark knight rises   considering british director christopher nolans claim to fame specializing in comic book superhero blockbusters the least of dubious celebratory proclamations of the film was plenty of preview studio publicity announcing in effect an industrial light and magic show bells and whistles galore to behold not unlike ironically the actual spectator sport on and originally off screen of oppenheimer and companys original dress rehearsal detonation in the desert in goggles and gaping with glee   a theoretical physicist and director of the manhattan projects los alamos laboratory during world war ii a secret installation who mission was to develop and build the first nuclear weapons  and hence often called the father of the atomic bomb j robert oppenheimer is the subject of the bloated three hour biopic oppenheimer currently predicted to grab assorted oscars this year while this analysis essentially explores the staggering contradictions of the existence itself of this production  and as a side note a film that saw the entire cast and crew walking out of the london premiere in support of the hollywood strikes  yet had no effect on the massive publicity extravaganza celebrating the theatrical release and on the political front oppenheimer who seemed to dabble in communism as a hobby also named names under mccarthyism watta guy to memorialize in a movie then again hollywood would have no qualms about that destroying so many lives and precipitating suicides under the blacklist themselves but at the same time a film teeming with metaphorical possibilities whether intentional or not for instance early on a scene with oppenheimer as a student injecting an apple on his despised science teachers desk with a smuggled toxic lab chemical there  and in that sense giving rise to theatrical intimations of the biblical genesis  with oppenheimer as simultaneously original sins combo serpent and the first man  in this case banished from the garden of eden whether as creator of the first bomb potentially obliterating humankind or the destruction of the hope of eden hypothetically the rise of socialism back then a potential utopia he contributed to destroying by naming names  or perhaps both and speaking of which a distracting and exhausting focus on the anticommunist mccarthy hearings seemingly in excruciating real time for a huge portion of the proceedings that could have benefited enormously from cutting room floor considerations  while somehow giving rise to a dubious new genre cspan cinema never has the red scare come off as this exceedingly dull  on the other hand what would a biopic about a flawed formidable man be without bad mothers like his wife the usual historical witch personas and in this case femme fatales in a nutshell oppenheimer in the real world visited his old lover on the sly depicted during much promoted online nude romp scenes away from his wife who in turn left her husband for oppenheimer divorcing her spouse after oppenheimer knocks her up and oppenheimers bad behavior culminating in lover number ones suicide but never mind this movie is presumably all about oppenheimers bombs with bombshells secondary  and ironically oppenheimer himself who relished playing it both ways  basking in the glory of his atomic claim to fame while denouncing the bomb naming names of presumed political comrades and concealing his women from one another  could very likely as an alleged communist have denounced the film released during the hollywood strikes  while simultaneously basking in the attention the film has bestowed upon him
Nov 28 2023,positive, oppenheimer now streaming on peacock in addition to vod services like amazon prime video is an anomaly a prestigeauteurdriven notamoviebutafilm that was a wild box office success christopher nolans inventive bio of j robert oppenheimer the father of the atomic bomb raked in 950 million worldwide in spite of being a talky threehour drama that features only one explosion but hey that boom is a really really big one one wonders if the film wouldve been such a mighty financial success without the barbenheimer phenomenon which inspired people to flock to theaters for a barbieoppenheimer cognitivedissonance doublefeature  or without the megahyped imax 70mm release which amplified nolans inspired visual presentation the likes of which lesser directors would probably never consider applying to a historical biopic about a quantumphysics genius another component of the anomaly this megabigscreen film works pretty damn well at home on our tvs too  the gist the first two images we see in oppenheimer are rain and fire appropriately the third is of oppenheimer himself cillian murphy who embodies both not too long after this once nolan shifts from black and white to color switches aspect ratios and establishes a few plot strands set in different decades  once nolan does his nolan thing you might say  oppenheimer sits down a university student to discuss how light functions as both wave and particle its paradoxical  and yet it works oppenheimer says which is also a remarkably pithy onpoint description of the man himself in the moments between these scenes we see oppenheimer as a young man and brilliant student in the mid1920s we meet lewis strauss in 1959 robert downey jr as hes on the cusp of his senate confirmation to president eisenhowers cabinet we watch as oppenheimer is subject to an antagonistic 1954 hearing over whether his government security clearance should be reinstated and we see strauss offer oppenheimer a job then get miffed when he believes oppenheimer spoke poorly of him to albert einstein tom conti cut into all of this are nearly abstract shots of lights sparks flares and stars oppenheimer is about to start a fire that no amount of rain will ever put out these myriad plotlines eventually almost settle down a little as gen leslie groves matt damon lures oppenheimer away from his gig teaching quantum physics and they get to the business of developing the atom bomb hitlers cutting through europe and the allies worry that hes developing his own weapon of mass destruction its oppenheimers job to beat the fuhrer to the punch groves enables him to build an entire town dubbed los alamos in the middle of the new mexico desert where all the scientists and technicians can bring their families and dedicate all their time to the effort meanwhile we flash back to how oppenheimer met his wife kitty emily blunt who struggles with depression and alcoholism as well as how he met jean tatlock florence pugh his mistress being with two partners at once is applying quantum mechanics to love you know the two women share one thing in common membership in the us communist party and oppenheimers fringe interest in such farleft politics will dog him for decades to be fair he seems more like a noncommittal sort when it comes to politics and women more driven by an intellectual curiosity that rejects binary ideas case in point is the atomic bomb good or bad a deterrent or an accelerant the weapon to end all war or inspire more war oppenheimer wrestles with the paradox but cant pin it to the mat all the narratives roll forward oppenheimers hearing gets heated strauss confirmation gets heated too and as the los alamos project progresses oppenheimer and co stare down the likelihood of the bomb creating a chain reaction thatll set the atmosphere aflame destroying the entire planet what are the chances near zero is the answer but thats not zero and perhaps it goes without saying that everyone would feel a lot better if it was zero as history dictates they soldier on anyway dozens of characters exchange dialogue with murphyasoppenheimer and theyre played by josh hartnett dane dehaan casey affleck rami malek kenneth branagh benny safdie jason clarke david dastmalchian alden ehrenreich macon blair josh peck jack quaid olivia thirlby and gary oldman as harry truman some of these characters feel the reverberations of that infamous bomb test in the new mexico desert more than others but its safe to say oppenheimer felt them the most  what movies will it remind you of theyre two wildly different artists i know but nolans oppenheimer and wes andersons asteroid city are both piercing and complex explorations of atomicage existentialism  performance worth watching oldman blatantly steals his only scene between this and fair play ehrenreich has reasserted himself after facing some not entirely deserving criticism for solo a star wars story pugh makes the absolute most of her limited screen time murphy is never anything less than fully committed and is that josh hartnett yes indeed thats josh hartnett but the performance well carry with us the longest is downeys whose memorably acerbic role as this storys greasypolitics villain will likely make him an oscar frontrunner our take as depicted here oppenheimer is not at all a man of certainty which in the midcentury context makes him not much of a man at all real men are decisive and stick to their guns and double down and never ever change their minds you know the type but those hombres anchor genre movies westerns action flicks and arent the subjects of complicated 180minute biodramas that build and build and build and build to a nuclear explosion thats so nonclimactic its followed by another entire hour of movie not that the kaboom isnt memorable its intense and aweinspiring rattling body and mind with its physicality and implications and its the only thing that shakes oppenheimer from his habit of being ideologically evasive murphy is extraordinary at carrying this mans multitudes his take on oppenheimer is that of a brilliant scientist whos gifted at inspiring other bright minds to build upon his ideas a man committed to telling the truth no matter what and a deeply flawed human being in murphys performance you sense the struggle within oppenheimer to tamp down emotions outside of his enthusiasm for pure scientific pursuits but when politics muddy those pursuits the emotion swells cracking his facade is he a communist yes and no does he like being a husband and family man yes and no does he think the atomic bomb is the granddaddy of all ideological cans of worms yes of course he does and his attempt to compartmentalize his work in the lab from realworld implications is surely his greatest failure believe it or not nolans storytelling here is crisp and economic the narrative moving urgently thanks to jennifer lames brisk editing oppenheimer is as propulsive as dialoguedriven habitually timehopping threehour character studies get an uneasy score and onedge performances generating simmering tension up to and through the big detonation and the subsequent fallout when oppenheimer tries to split the hairs of fame and infamy of guilt and righteousness nolans loopdelooping screenplay mirrors the ethical curlicues oppenheimer navigates throughout and is packed with dialogue that feels elevated and pragmatic dozens of sloganeering lines laced with double meanings at the service of a procedural underscored with the terrifying moral dilemmas of the cold war and struggle existential metaphors involving black holes dying stars shattered atoms and things we struggle to comprehend and dont want to think about sure we might chuckle when matt damon allcaps bellows this is the most important fing thing in the history of the world but we cant argue that its not justified oppenheimer gives us perhaps the years most horrifying sequence when the protagonist gives an unconvincing jingoistic speech to los alamos residents and from his point of view its a surrealistic nightmare a boozesoaked quasireligious scene of screaming crying laughing rapture people stomp and clap and chant his name for hes the man who ended the war by inventing the bomb that killed hundreds of thousands of people the chain reaction has started and it feels like the beginning of the end its the only time we see him speak a lie  our call stream it oppenheimer is an ambitious film one of the most ambitious ever about an ambitious project also one of the most ambitious ever for better or worse nolan blows up the traditional biopic and rebuilds it in thrilling dynamic fashion
Nov 27 2023,positive, j robert oppenheimer was a theoretical physicist who was the director of the manhattan projects los alamos lab during world war ii  he is also often referred to as the father of the atomic bomb for his work on the project  a fact he often struggled with later in his lifetime his work beliefs and relationships have always been a subject of discussion and this past summer director christopher nolan tenet brought a threehour epic drama to theaters  oppenheimer the second biggest grossing film of the summer behind barbie made close to a billion dollars worldwide is now in stores for purchase on 4k uhd cillian murphy red eye portrays the scientist with an air of serious conviction  he is very well cast as he embodies the calm yet determined nature of oppenheimer while he isnt physically a match for oppenheimer he manages well enough for the purposes of this drama emily blunt the devil wears prada as his wife kitty is a solid choice as she goes through a range of emotions  matt damon the martian who can be hit or miss with his choices of film roles does a good job as general leslie groves the us army corps of engineers officer who oversees the manhattan project  supporting cast members including robert downey jr iron man jason clarke dawn of the planet of the apes alden ehrenreich solo a star wars story tony goldwyn scandal kenneth branagh much ado about nothing and florence pugh black widow give oppenheimer an added level of credibility as they are all adeptly skilled in the craft of acting the 2160p video quality is outstanding with details so sharp that one can see the threads on the suits that murphy and other cast members wear  the visual effects of the explosion are perfect and dont look unnatural at all every detail offers clean lines and brilliant colors  as much as color can play a role in desert scenes  the lush hues of californias greenery are deep and true and give the film some depth the surprise with this release is that the audio is only presented in dtshd master audio 51 instead of dolby atmos  while the 51 version is topnotch one cant help but wonder if the quality would not have been enhanced by the latest technology  perhaps the variation was so minute that universal pictures felt it was an unnecessary upgrade  regardless the sound from dialogue to effects and even the score is stunning  it doesnt feel as though anything is missing by not presenting the movie in atmos plus trailers innovations in film 65mm blackandwhite film in oppenheimer meet the press qa panel oppenheimer and to end all war oppenheimer  the atomic bomb  oppenheimer is arguably one of the best films of the year and it wouldnt be surprising if it didnt get at least a few oscar nominations whether or not you have already seen it you will want to add it to your home entertainment collection and this combo pack is the way to go as it has superior technical quality and a plethora of interesting extras that are worth watching more than once for more information about oppenheimer visit the flickdirect movie database this release has been provided to flickdirect for review purposes                  for more reviews by allison rose please click here allison rose a senior correspondent and critic at flickdirect is a dynamic presence in the entertainment industry with a communications degree from hofstra university she brings her film expertise to krms newstalk 975 fm and broadcast television and is recognized as a tomatometerapproved critic her role as an adept event moderator in various entertainment industry forums underscores her versatility her affiliations with sefca the florida film critics circle and the online film critics society highlight her as an influential figure in film criticism and media
Nov 25 2023,positive, the equalizer 3movie collection 20142023 running for four seasons 19851989 tvs the equalizer found british actor edward woodward the wicker man recently reviewed here essaying the role of robert mccall a former government operative employing his impressive skills to help out those too weak and powerless to fight back in the samenamed film the equalizer 2014 robert mccall has been reborn in the personage of denzel washington who similarly brings enormous reserves of brains brawn and bravado to the part making small talk with another regular customer at his favorite diner a tooyoung call girl named teri chloë grace moretz mccall can easily surmise that her vocation isnt exactly what this russian immigrant had in mind for herself  that becomes even more clear after shes brutally beaten by russian thugs who control her very existence realizing he can no longer stand idly by mccall taps into his longburied past to help him with this present situation the equalizer is about as subtle as a pneumatic stapler shot to the temple with mccall worthy of sainthood and the villains worthy of being satans emissaries on earth but who wants subtlety when one can bask in the glory of denzel obliterating remorseless degenerates left and right like the original and only decent entry in liam neesons taken series this isnt a film for those seeking moral ambiguity or thoughtprovoking shades of gray its cinema as catharsis allowing ordinary people weary of living in a world run by vile criminals and corrupt cops the fantasy of seeing a sentient superman righting all wrongs on their behalf pimps and other likeminded creeps who prey on women  whether murdering them torturing them controlling them antichoice anyone or grabbing them by the ahem  represent just about the worst that humanity has to offer so when mccall deals with them in violent fashion progressive viewers just might cheer out loud as noted watching denzels former cia operative deal with all manner of evildoers over the course of the equalizer is a cathartic experience but the movie also works because of its kinetic action scenes as well as a gradual reveal of the layers of washingtons character the equalizer 2 2018 offers no such pleasures this is a particularly dreary film one which makes no attempt to freshen up or even disguise its rote storyline as in many an unimaginative sequel this time its personal meaning that mccalls cia pal susan melissa leo gets killed once she gets too close to the truth regarding a faked murdersuicide  that truth is so fleetingly and haphazardly explained that it scarcely matters and susan might as well have been slain for trying to steal a neighbors cherished pie recipe a subplot involving mccalls mentoring relationship with a young kid ashton sanders seems to have been imported from a lesser abc afterschool special from the 1970s and while the equalizer was excessively brutal because the plot demanded it the equalizer 2 is excessively brutal because the filmmakers demanded it it all culminates with a lengthy battle royale in which mccall faces down the baddies while a storm rages all around them its laughably absurd and just one more reason why the equalizer 2 despite typically strong work from washington is less than the sum of its slickly oiled parts as heavily reported at the time of its release the equalizer 2 was the first sequel denzel ever made a mindblowing fact considering the number of actors only too happy to remain aboard any given gravy train with the equalizer 3 2023 we now get only the second followup denzel has ever made clearly the superstar has great affinity for the character of robert mccall and it shows in this pictures plot whereas the heroes in other action flicks find themselves trapped in a neverending series of carboncopy adventures or only slow down and sleep when theyre dead mccall is one of the very few who has a legitimate chance at a happily ever after retirement from bloodletting when his latest dogooder deed takes him to italy he ends up recuperating from a particularly nasty injury in a quiet coastal town where everyone seemingly knows everyone else mccall responds positively to the region and its people and he considers making the town his permanent home  first though he must rid the area of a mafialike outfit whose members are into drugrunning murder and general sneering with a more focused storyline and a greater emphasis on character the equalizer 3 is a definite improvement over the previous picture it also benefits from the clever casting of dakota fanning here playing acerbic cia agent emma collins fanning was all of 10 when she previously costarred with washington in 2004s man on fire shes now 29 and its trippy seeing this former moppet squaring off against denzel and playing an adult who gives as good as she gets no points though for figuring out how emma is connected to mccalls past as the big reveal turns out to be no big deal with its utter predictability this new bluray collection is being released alongside standalone editions of the equalizer 3 the e3 4k and blu extras include deleted scenes a look at the reunion between washington and fanning and the lyric video for jacob banks monster the fugitive 1993 movies based on primetime television series have long tended to be sorry excuses for cinematic enshrinement the dukes of hazzard the beverly hillbillies the honeymooners about 1000 more but the fugitive remains one of the very best examples of the exception to that rule both a critical and commercial smash when it hit theaters 30 years ago this adaptation of the classic tv show 19631967 stars harrison ford as richard kimble a chicago doctor whose wife sela ward is murdered by a onearmed man for unknown reasons with no evidence though the police finger kimble as the killer and hes quickly arrested tried and sentenced to death but after a spectacular trainandbus collision sets him free he searches for the murderer himself  hes pursued every step of the way by us marshall sam gerard tommy lee jones who cares far more about catching his man than wondering whether said man is guilty or innocent directed for maximum impact by andrew davis from a sharp script by jeb stuart and david twohy this contains enough suspenseful setpieces clever red herrings and spectacular stuntwork to satisfy most thriller aficionados yet what really makes the movie work are the performances by the two leads ford is believable as the tormented hero  indeed a key ingredient to the films success is how firmly he commands audience sympathy  while jones is outandout terrific as the arrogant neversayquit lawman nominated for seven academy awards including best picture this earned jones the best supporting actor oscar extras in the 4k uhd  digital code edition consist of audio commentary by davis and jones an introduction by davis and ford a pair of makingof featurettes a breakdown of the train wreck sequence and the theatrical trailer in love and war 1996 alls poor in in love and war a major miscalculation with two flailing stars under the tutelage of a dull director richard attenborough a decent actor who began performing in 1942 but only took up directing in 1969 has long maintained a reputation in many nonbafta circles as a stodgy helmer while his attention to plodding detail worked quite well for 1982s gandhi his best film and the one that earned him a best director oscar it muted other pictures that might have benefitted from a more robust style such as a chorus line and a bridge too far attenboroughs most popular roles included squadron leader bartlett in the great escape and john hammond in jurassic park and we should give thanks that he acted in rather than directed those thrillaminute classics but i digress the 113minute in love and war takes what should have been a moving love story  the factbased dalliance between a 19yearold ernest hemingway and a 26yearold nurse  and makes it about as emotionally involving as a 180minute documentary on aglet production chris odonnell plays hemingway as a cocky yet sweet kid whose boundless energy results in a serious leg injury during a world war i skirmish this places him in the care of agnes von kurowsky sandra bullock and it was the earnest ernests doomed romance with her that arguably transformed him into the macho womanizing heman known to all and inarguably informed some of his writing the character of catherine barkley in a farewell to arms was based on her watching the bland odonnell attempt to convey soulful anguish is a sight in itself while a sluggish bullock seems distracted throughout perhaps reflecting on whether it was a mistake to agree to star in the upcoming speed 2 cruise control answer it was oppenheimer 2023 it was quite gratifying to see that both halves of the barbenheimer phenomenon lived up to the hype with the social frenzy so earpiercingly loud that it probably belonged in an imax production directed by christopher nolan while greta gerwigs barbie recently reviewed here offers sunshine and rainbow colors to go with its satiric and social themes nolans oppenheimer presents a suitably sobering drama that largely hangs under a mushroom cloud of darkly troubling sociopolitical issues one of the best films of the year thus far this finds nolan regular cillian murphy moving from supporting player to leading man for the helmer  he delivers a superb performance as j robert oppenheimer the physicist whose work on the manhattan project led to the creation of the atom bomb a threehour motion picture that never wears out its welcome the film written and directed by nolan and adapted from the biography american prometheus the triumph and tragedy of j robert oppenheimer covers a startling amount of ground examining not only oppenheimers years on the assignment but also his relationships with his strongwilled wife kitty emily blunt and his troubled mistress jean tatlock an excellent florence pugh his crippling guilt over the hundreds of thousands killed in japan toward the close of world war ii and the postwar circumstances that damaged his career oppenheimer features an allstar cast but the picture isnt merely collecting alisters as if they were baseball cards  from matt damon as the supportive general groves to robert downey jr as the shifty atomic

and understanding to the proceedings extras in the bluray  dvd  digital code edition include a makingof featurette a qa panel chat and a piece on the atomic bomb the police academy collection 19841994 what pray tell might rightly be considered the worst movie franchise minimum four films in hollywood history while my personal vote would be neatly sliced down the middle with each half given to the transformers and friday the 13th series its hard to argue against the folks who would insist it was this inane comedy franchise that dominated much of the 1980s with one straggler appearing in the 90s that there was a total of seven of these things  not to mention a liveaction television series an animated tv show a comic book and even a global theme park attraction  boggles the mind it would be easy to chalk it up to the ofttimes dubious taste of the american public see also grown ups the apprentice anything to do with the kardashians except that these pictures were even more popular overseas police academy 1984 certainly demonstrated why there was at least one sequel as the first picture in the series was one of the top 10 grossers of 1984 thereby rubbing shoulders with genuinely funny flicks like beverly hills cop ghostbusters and romancing the stone a mandate by the mayor states that the metropolitan police department must accept all applicants regardless of age weight iq etc thus we get the usual assemblage of slobs misfits and underachievers including the affable carey mahoney steve guttenberg desperately trying to channel an inner bill murray that doesnt exist the towering moses hightower bubba smith the wacky larvell jones michael winslow the guncrazy eugene tackleberry david graf the bold and busty debbie callahan leslie easterbrook the mousy laverne hooks

thaddeus harris gw bailey the poor mans herbert lomchief inspector dreyfus from the pink panther series serving as a constant foil the movie isnt really much funnier than its sorry sequels but its the best of the bunch simply by virtue of being fresh or as fresh as this moldy premise can get and by introducing winslows amazing selfproduced sound effects to the general population practically every picture in the series showcased a pretty woman to serve as a oneanddone opposite guttenberg or his equally blasé replacements in the later entries  here its kim cattrall as the shapely cadet who cant resist mahoneys obnoxious ways the original police academy was the only movie in the series to earn an r rating for nudity and profanity natch  police academy 2 their first assignment 1985 was pg13 while the subsequent five flicks all garnered benign pg ratings this one finds the former cadets now graduates assigned to police the most dangerous part of town easterbrook is mia bailey has been replaced as the fumbling foil by art metrano as lieutenant mauser and colleen camps kathleen kirkland is introduced as a love interest for tackleberry but never mind all that the real story is the arrival of bobcat goldthwait to the series playing a gang leader named zed mcglunk anyone familiar with 80s lowbrow humor is familiar with goldthwait who typically played twitchy stuttering goofballs hes fascinating to behold although whether thats a positive or a negative is up to each individual viewer at 11 this barely missed out on making the years top 10 grossers list pushed out by the yearend chevy chasedan aykroyd comedy spies like us police academy 3 back in training 1986 finds the gang returning to the titular institute to help lassard prevent its probable closing easterbrook reappears thus reuniting the first pictures notsomagnificent seven metrano remains goldthwaits zed is now one of the good guys as a new cadet and guttenbergs plaything this time around is a comely cadet played by 1980 miss south carolina  miss usa  miss universe shawn weatherly as in all the other films the majority of the jokes whether visual or verbal dont even bother with a payoff which is an odd way to approach comedy its also the only film series in which the characters somehow manage to become even less developed with each passing entry police academy 4 citizens on patrol 1987 is pretty selfexplanatory with the regulars joined in their efforts to rid the city of crime by ordinary citizens recruited to be ersatz cops bailey returns as the sneaky lieutenant harris and the supporting cast has more recognizable names than usual sharon stone as mahoneys latest conquest david spade in his film debut randall tex cobb as a heavy and an 18yearold tony hawk among the skateboarders making cameo appearances its the sameold sameold only somehow slightly worse police academy 4 marked guttenbergs last series appearance and with his departure the filmmakers introduced a boring new vanilla character to replace him in police academy 5 assignment miami beach 1988 that would be lassards nephew nick matt mccoy and this entrys sweetheart du jour is an officer trained in physical combat janet jones who became wayne gretskys wife in the same year she made this goldthwait also bailed on the series after pa4 leaving rené auberjonois to attempt to add some semblance of laughs as an excitable jewel thief one of the series worst characters harris braindead assistant carl proctor lance kinsey was introduced back in part deux the filmmakers somehow thought it was a good idea to increase his role with each passing picture so this one goes allout with his imbecilic antics with police academy 6 city under siege 1989 the series decided to skip bottomofthebarrel status and immediately burrow beneath the barrel this dreadful entry finds the gang unearthing a leak inside their inner circle one that is allowing a gang of criminals to successfully pull off a series of

and additional scenes the scarlet letter 1934 given its lofty literary status its perhaps surprising that there havent been more film adaptations of nathaniel hawthornes 1850 novel the scarlet letter the vast majority have been silent films all largely forgotten save for the 1926 favorite starring lillian gish as for sound versions there have been three with the most infamous being the 1995 debacle in which demi moore was so unconvincing as hester prynne that they might as well have cast roger moore or dudley moore in the part this was also the one containing the risible scene of robert duvall dancing around a campfire with a dead deer balanced on his head there was a 1973 german take directed by wim wenders and then theres this 1934 adaptation the film begins with a written foreword thats less hawthorne and more hollywood production code reading in part though to us the puritan customs seem grim and the punishments hard they were a necessity of the times and helped shape the destiny of a nation in 17th century boston hester prynne colleen moore is forced to wear the letter a on her garments for committing adultery and conceiving a child out of wedlock she refuses to name the father who turns out to be minister arthur dimmesdale hardie albright meanwhile hesters husband henry b walthall who also played the part in the lillian gish version returns after a lengthy absence and is determined to discover the dads identity often static and burdened with incongruous comic relief this remains watchable due largely to its relative faithfulness to hawthornes potent source material bluray extras include audio commentary by professor jason a ney with contributions by cora sue collins who played little pearl in the picture and is still with us at the age of 96 a look at nathaniel hawthorne on film and the trailer from a 1965 rerelease stalag 17 1953 its easy to see why this world war ii yarn from billy wilder who earned a best director oscar nomination for his efforts was a resounding success upon its release different than most of the more baldly jingoistic wwii flicks that had preceded it it combined hardbiting drama and broad humor in a manner not usually seen in war flicks of the period today the drama survives intact but the humor proves to be a serious drag set in a pow camp the film stars william holden as sefton whose selfserving actions alienate him from the other american soldiers held in the same barracks when it becomes apparent that theres a german spy among the pows in stalag 17 all suspicion falls on sefton whos forced to out the enemy informant before the other gis turn vigilante on him holden won the best actor oscar for his unsentimental turn as the sob pow but while hes typically solid in the role its shocking to note how little screen time he ultimately commands instead stalag 17 functions as an ensemble piece which is fine when it focuses on the taut dramatic aspects of the tale but detrimental when it breaks the mood by centering on the slapstick antics of two buffoonish soldiers played by robert strauss and harvey lembeck strauss incessant mugging as animal inexplicably earned him an oscar nod for best supporting actor yet i suspect his role is even larger than that of topbilled holden extras on the 4k uhd  bluray edition include audio commentary by supporting actors richard erdman and gil stratton

Nov 21 2023,positive, there are very few directors working today whose new project getting released would be considered a major event theres the beloved martin scorsese and the everpopular quentin tarantino but there is perhaps none bigger or more ambitious than the great christopher nolan whether hes giving us a wondrous original creation or adapting material in only a way that he can his projects bring with them a grand sense of anticipation that have you excited  eager to see what new visions hell bring to the screen for his latest opus hes chosen to tackle something weve yet to see him do a biopic however this is not just any biopic its a portrait of an immensely complicated man who helped to shape the second half of the 20th century j robert oppenheimer known to the world as the father of the atomic bomb oppenheimer is told primarily in three different time periods chronologically we have one thread starting in 1926 following robert cillian murphy in his early days as he studies at cambridge before taking some advice from dr niels bohr kenneth branagh to continue in germany instead he eventually begins teaching at berkeley where he is recruited by general leslie groves matt damon for the manhattan project in 1942 a top secret operation to create a nuclear weapon before the nazis  another thread involves a hearing in 1954 regarding roberts security clearance which has been questioned due to his past activities with communism finally a third thread in 1959 follows a senate confirmation hearing for lewis strauss robert downey jr a former colleague of roberts on the atomic energy commission their relationship is closely examined with certain truths  motivations eventually coming to light the film cuts back and forth among the three times in an effort to give us some understanding of this very misunderstood individual as the film opens you may find yourself a bit disoriented at first as it shifts through and establishes the different threads it takes a minute to grasp what is happening and when before it settles down to tell you oppenheimers story from the beginning as it does you may find yourself becoming a little concerned as i was on my first viewing that its moving just a little slow as it explores roberts early days of studying his relationship with his eventual wife kitty emily blunt his affair with jean tatlock florence pugh and his eventual settling at berkeley however all this is merely a prelude leading up to where the film truly takes off that of course is when robert is recruited to the manhattan project from here nolan fully immerses us in the project showing us how everything came together including the recruitment of scientists the building of los alamos the hard work and determination that went into designing the weapon the many tests and the eventual detonation of the real deal this section detailing the multitude of complications along the way is compelling  fascinating on its own but nolan wasnt about to stop there the film also becomes a remarkable dissection of how oppenheimer dealt with the aftermath primarily the overwhelming guilt that led him to speak out against the hbomb a subsequent project that many people wanted to pursue and as if that wasnt enough nolan goes even further to turn the film into a captivating courtroom drama of sorts as oppenheimers character is called into question during his private hearing for his security clearance a hearing in which his past communist affiliations opinions and actions are dredged up and used to viciously attack him all of this is intertwined with strauss confirmation hearing in which his part in the story is slowly unraveled nolans threehour epic may start a little slowly but make no mistake once it passes the aforementioned prelude it hits the gas and never lets up this is one of those projects where you really have to marvel at the cast nolan was able to assemble not only do you have a wonderful turn from cillian murphy who hits every note perfectly with his performance and robert downey jr quite possibly delivering the performance of his career but you also get incredible work from emily blunt florence pugh matt damon sir kenneth branagh josh hartnett jason clarke casey affleck and more this is truly an ensemble piece and every piece here fits just right this being a christopher nolan film the stunning technical  design work also needs to be mentioned every element is handled with perfection including jennifer lames editing hoyte van hoytemas cinematography ludwig göranssons score the visual effects sound and production design this is all on top of nolans outstanding direction which flawlessly brings all of these components together into an unforgettable experience finally nolans screenplay adapted from american prometheus by kai bird and martin j sherwin must have its due this is a very intricatelywritten tale that skillfully weaves together three different periods shifting just when it needs to revealing details at just the right time and brilliantly turning this into so much more than just another bythenumbers biopic anyone could have delivered a straightforward film about the life of j robert oppenheimer but it takes someone of nolans caliber to go beyond that and truly dive into the man to give us a more intimate portrait one that attempts to convey the immense impact all of these events had on him with oppenheimer nolan accomplishes that to a dazzling degree resulting in not just one of the very best films of the year but also one of the finest accomplishments of his career oppenheimer comes to bluray in a 2201 1781 for imax scenes 1080p high definition transfer of marvelous quality the image is brilliantly sharp throughout perfectly preserving all of the hard work that went into its incredible visuals likewise the 51 dtshd master audio track is outstanding giving you all of the dialogue sound effects and ludwig göranssons score in excellent quality overall you simply couldnt ask for better quality for such an extraordinary epic the film comes with over three hours of fantastic extensive extras the incredible making of told in seven chapters is particularly worth checking out while the to end all war documentary is great for those wanting to delve more into the man himself with its brilliant screenplay skillfully weaving together three different periods an exceptional ensemble stunning technical  design elements and magnificent direction bringing it all together christopher nolans oppenheimer stands not only as one of the very best films of the year but also one of the finest accomplishments of his remarkable career
Nov 20 2023,positive,  christopher nolan has expended an enormous amount of creative energy serving as director producer and writer of this engrossing biopicture about j robert oppenheimer the brilliant american theoretical physicist who oversaw the secret manhattan project at los alamos new mexico to develop an atomic bomb this bold intense inventively filmed and wellacted thriller is based on kai bird and martin j sherwins pulitzer prizewinning 2005 biography american prometheus the triumph and tragedy of j robert oppenheimer   as if taking off from that line nolan has structured his film around two heartbreaking incidents in oppenheimers life first and foremost of course is his role in the development of the bombs that were dropped on hiroshima on august 6 1945 and three days later on nagasaki   the second incident is a secret hearing held in 1954 to determine whether to revoke oppenheimers security clearance supposedly it was to investigate oppenheimers ties with known communists early in his career and with suspected disloyal scientists at los alamos but the investigators were also concerned about his outspoken statements against the hydrogen bomb yet to be developed his advocacy of arms control and against nuclear proliferation and his concerns about the arms race during the cold war with russia how could the father of the bomb end up opposed to it   nolan has chosen to film the scenes of the hearing in blackandwhite as if such confrontations could ever be that simple through oppenheimers own and others testimonies we learn of his studies at harvard cambridge and the university of gottingen in germany and his later position as lead physicist at berkeley we see him interacting with his brother frank dylan arnold and his girlfriend jean tatlock florence pugh both members of the community party his wife kitty emily blunt also had communist ties though she affirms that her husband had never joined the party   in flashbacks to key moments of his career we see oppenheimer interacting with scientists niles bohr kenneth branagh and albert einstein tom conti we observe his relationship with general leslie groves matt damon the government watchdog over the threeyear 2 billion manhattan project we also see the development of a rivalry with lewis strauss robert downey jr who was instrumental in pushing for the security hearing   throughout the film cillian murphy seems to literally embody the mental genius and pained emotional and ethical presence of the pioneering physicist and persecuted antinuclear activist his amazing performance sweeps across 40 years of academic competition political chicanery courtroom drama espionage rightwing paranoia antisemitism technological advance and ethical debate

Oct 2 2023,negative, oppenheimer christopher nolans mammoth and exhausting portrait of the father of the atomic bomb desperately wants to impress you but its too high on its own fumes to make good on its lofty ambitions the inception auteurs first effort after parting ways with warner bros adapts the pulitzer prizewinning oppenheimer biography american prometheus for the screen the bigger the better it detonates all sorts of conflicting emotions but lets go with the top two awe at its visual splendor and impressionistic cadences and frustration at its stubborn insistence in stitching together two films in one theres the one you probably came to see which is the story of a team of brainy academics brought together to create a weapon of mass destruction before those across the atlantic do and thus secure a victory for the allied powers during world war ii but the universal release also springs forward several years to offer a glimpse at the political fallout lathered in backstabbing and guilt from those twin mushroom clouds the latter narrative strand initially appears to serve as a framing device for the first one its mostly comprised of a series of hearings in 1954 behind closed doors by the atomic energy commission in order to determine whether j robert oppenheimer now nearly a decade removed from his bestknown accomplishment will retain his security clearance the hearings provide nolan with an engine to hone in on oppenheimers public and private life the bulk of oppenheimer unfolds in these artfully crafted flashbacks bolstered by quick cuts streamofconsciousness links between different moments in time set to the relentless drone of ludwig goranssons walltowall music score its an ornate fever dream that metastasizes into a nightmare in ways that are initially thrilling but ultimately draining you feel your enthusiasm ebb away nolan takes us as far back as oppenheimers days in cambridge where a student with disdain for mathematics and lab work meets fellow travelers who will prove to be pivotal figures in the years to come that apt but restless pupil played as a young man and as the eventual agent of destruction by cillian murphy is encouraged by danish physicist niels bohr kenneth branagh to complete his doctorate at the university of gottingen in germany  oppenheimer meets fellow theoretical physicist werner heisenberg matthia schweighofer both men are mutual admirers fully unaware they would be on opposing sides on the arms race in the coming conflict serving as a conscience and a welcome source of warmth for our driven protagonist is fellow physicist isidor isaac rabi a nearly unrecognizable david krumholtz quietly becoming one of the movies mvps oppenheimer could have used more of the modesty that the pudgy rabi with his maternal instinct to remind the railthin oppie to eat eat brings to the table but nolan forges ahead as if hes making the cinematic equivalent of the great american novel back on us soil oppenheimers associations include members of the communist party though he keeps his distance he begins a sordid affair with jean tatlock florence pugh a party member who happens to be a married woman before he meets kitty emily blunt the woman he would eventually wed rare for nolan glimpses of lovemaking ensue climaxing with a surreal flourish later in the film that draws unintentional laughs nolan may not be afraid to show sex on screen though murphy shows conspicuously less skin than pugh but the director remains a bit of a square in that department but oppenheimer cant stop wont stop and after overcoming several hurdles uncle sam comes knocking in the form of us army lt gen leslie groves matt damon the corps of engineers officer who directed the ultrasecret manhattan project the verbal sparring between oppie and groves leading to oppie spearheading the los alamos laboratory in new mexico is one of the films highlights  the fireworks that the characters arguments generate acted to perfection by the stars go against the rest of the films eatyourveggies approach to 20thcentury history thus underscoring the need for oppenheimers againsttheclock manhattan project scenes to be their own movie unencumbered by the added weight of the films causeandeffect framing several scenes involving oppie and albert einstein well played by tom conti attempt to weave in both timelines but theyre not enough to give credit where credit is due nolan nails the money shot sequence the doordie nuclear test that proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that the atom bomb would serve its lethal purpose and bring the war to an end but then it dawns of you that the movies not quite done not even close in what feels like an additional hour its a bit less but goodness you feel the length oppenheimer returns to the 1954 hearings and dives headlong into the ripple effects of the hiroshima and nagasaki bombings this is when the spotlight shines on robert downey jrs lewis strauss  businessman philanthropist naval officer member of the atomic energy commission and ostensible helping hand to an embattled oppenheimer besieged by attacks on his character downey takes the juicy role and runs with it the iron man star helps anchor several scenes shot in imax black and white a first for kodak where strauss up for a cabinet post in the eisenhower administration several years after the aec oppenheimer hearings is grilled by senators about oppenheimer and the nuclear program  taken on their own the 1950s scenes are a gripping if somewhat naïve and simplistic portrayal of politics as a darwinian game of chess they also swallow the film whole dampening the excitement we feel as this group of scientists pull off the seemingly impossible oppenheimer would have benefited from a splitting of atomic particles or in this case narratives into two different films subtlety is not a nolan specialty and oppenheimer fuses his strengths and selfindulgent tendencies into a maelstrom of sound and fury that bring to mind oliver stone in fulltilt jfk mode some of the intricate crosscutting also recalls terrence malick the tree of life in particular but nolan and his bells and whistles lack malicks humility before the infinite to be fair oppenheimer is a sizable step up from tenet nolans impenetrable 2020 thriller thats toppled by its convoluted timehopping spy games  but his latest effort is too much of an endurance test a magnum opus consumed by its quest for significance caught in the middle is a uniformly strong cast made up of too many other familiar faces to name here as for murphy the peaky blinders star rises above the chaos its a pity the movie ends up imploding its adroitly conceived puzzle pieces coming apart in a rain of noble intentions and unmitigated ego  theater the actor nominated for a tony award for his portrayal as mrs doubtfire in the broadway musical comes to fort lauderdale in the national tour michelle f

Sep 25 2023,positive, the first indication that christopher nolan was going to be a unique and interesting filmmaker was there for all to see with his noteworthy second feature memento which was released in 2000 when he was 30 years of age the movies nonlinear narrative is delivered as two different sets of scenes interspersed during the film there are sequences in color that are shown in reverse order which reveal the mental state of the protagonist to the audience some scenes are shown chronologically in blackandwhite nolan likes to play fast and loose with time and space if he isnt careful this form of narrative storytelling can become pretentious if hes running on all cylinders theres an elegance to his movies that is beautiful and satisfying to behold nolans oppenheimer is beautiful to behold whether or not its satisfying depends on your appreciation for how he creates his cinema the film is a feast of nonlinear moviemaking its the most nolanesque feature hes made the story thats frontandcenter during the epic threehour movie is the making of the atomic bomb during the manhattan project at los alamos new mexico and its use on two japanese cities hiroshima and nagasaki in a successful effort which was approved by president harry s truman with the hopes of ending the war in the pacific born in new york city j robert oppenheimers life as highlighted in the film is centered around princeton university in new jersey cambridge in england the university of california at berkeley the extended sojourn at the los alamos laboratory during the building of the bomb and intense political hearings courtesy of the washington dc witch hunt for communist sympathizers in the united states government oppenheimer the movie is rich in detail that it unreels in flashbacks and flashforwards may be maddening for some but not for me its also in blackandwhite and in color in oppenheimer nolan takes an intelligent topic and turns it into a suspenseful experience the director who wrote the screenplay based on the biography american prometheus by kai bird and martin j sherwin has the canvas to concentrate on theoretical physicist oppenheimers intellectualism everincreasing selfconfidence internal thought processes poise and popularity as a leader and relationships with women he was unfaithful to his wife cillian murphy as oppenheimer is central to the greatness of the casting murphy never loses j roberts sense of duty or his belief that his goal is to save the lives of members of the american military by succeeding with the manhattan project hes a man who rarely eats he cares about everybody whos working on the bomb general leslie groves matt damon who oversees los alamos for truman is the kind of general thats needed when time is of the essence oppenheimers longsuffering wife katherine emily blunt provides necessary strength when it matters most his mistress jean tatlock florence pugh was a psychiatrist and occasional journalist albert einstein tom conti is visited in scenes of visual poetry does the movie falter in any way yes but not enough to derail it for me once the atomic bomb is dropped theres still 40 minutes to go and its here that nolan lets the subject matter get away from him slightly oppenheimer wasnt onboard with the u s governments desire to progress from the atomic to the hydrogen bomb truman calls him a crybaby this reluctance commands most of the films attention as senate and house hearings revolving around atomic energy commissioner lewis strausss future in washington and oppenheimers sudden disfavor with certain politicians are dissected in brutally intense blackandwhite sequences that prove exhausting as because they go on far too long nolan is insistent on making certain the focus stays on his main character so much so that japan and the horrors caused by the dropping of the bomb are only hinted at is oppenheimer a communist was his wife is he a traitor for not wanting to continue to create weapons of mass destruction some of the material could have been edited more tightly the saving grace for these seemingly endless scenes of political performance art are twofold one is murphys ability to project an almost religious dedication to the rightness of oppenheimers beliefs the destruction of hiroshima and nagasaki and the body count appalled him the other is the scintillating performance by robert downey jr as strauss a bureaucratic game player of the highest order the moment when strauss realizes what oppenheimer is actually doing in front of the determined members of congress is motion picture acting nirvana the 1954 hearing to adjudicate whether or not oppenheimers federal security should be renewed allows nolan almost infinite time to spin his directorial vision in myriad directions some previously hinted at some unique but all defining nolan the director and oppenheimer the man the father of the atomic bomb is wellserved one truth in the the movie is that the female characters track with what history recorded in that era women were less than equal and except for wives and the occasional secretary los alamos was a mans world in the overall story mrs oppenheimer and her husbands mistress are the most visible female characters oppenheimer is a fascinating individual his intense dreams are either rapturous or tormenting he figuratively visits the cosmos in them hes a scientist but for him science is an art form the true and genuine highlight for nolan murphy and the movie is the immediate buildup to and then the explosion of the test bomb its a bravura dance of imagery and sound but also lack of sound its an understanding of power without any of the essential characters in that moment knowing precisely whats to come first amendment congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of

Sep 20 2023,positive,oppenheimer is mythic massive and a masterful work from christopher nolan murphy  downey jr deliver career best performances in what is the most important movie of the decade
Sep 17 2023,positive, no figure stands more squarely at the crossroads of 20th century science and politics than j robert oppenheimer forever known as father of the atomic bomb an epic story requires an epic film and christopher nolan has given oppenheimer the treatment he demands in a threehour bio pic that manages to balance a portrait of this enigmatic personality with the earthshattering events that defined his life and times for nolan its a remarkably wellorganised film considering that his previous effort tenet 2020 was virtually incomprehensible one suspects this owes a debt to a script written in collaboration with kai bird and martin sherwin authors of the 2005 oppenheimer biography american prometheus the film doesnt tell us anything about oppenheimers upbringing as part of a wealthy jewish family in new york that owned paintings by van gogh and picasso we skip straight to his postgraduate studies at cambridge where he is clumsy in the laboratory but a prodigious theorist hes also unstable enough to inject an apple with poison as a way of getting even with a lecturer who humiliates him its an anecdote to demonstrate the old cliché that genius and madness are closely aligned if we need further proof of our subjects mental dexterity theres also the small matter of learning dutch in six weeks so he can deliver a lecture on quantum mechanics oppenheimers backstory is told in flashbacks framed by his appearance in front of a select committee in 1954 where he is being investigated as a security risk at this stage he is the most famous scientist in america renowned for his leadership at los alamos but his credibiity has been undermined by lewis strauss robert downey jr the chairman of the atomic energy commission who has worked behind the scenes to bring oppenheimer down its a complex relationship between the two men as strauss had been a key supporter of oppenheimer but turned against him after the scientist made him look foolish in a hearing the story of the atom bomb is rotated with this tale of political and personal intrigue in which strauss plays iago to oppenheimers othello the resonances with presentday politics are unmistakable as we recognise echoes of the way public health experts and environmental scientists were demonised by opportunistic politicians in the trump camp  a process that has bled into the public realm via social media and extremist opinionmongering masquerading as news to be truly without blemish in front of a committee in the mccarthy era it wasnt sufficient to have demonstrated ones loyalty to the united states by helping develop the greatest weapon of mass destruction in history as we see during the flashbacks oppenheimer took a lively interest in politics he was a vocal supporter of the spanish republic he argued for the unionisation of the science department at berkeley and associated with communist party members including jean tatlock florence pugh a disturbed fatal attraction with whom he had a longrunning affair strauss and his colleagues notably matt damon as general leslie groves were aware of oppenheimers political beliefs when they enlisted him to head up the manhattan project the usa was in competition the germans in the race to build a nuclear weapon and oppenheimer was simply the best man for the job as a nonobservant jew with leftwing sympathies his antipathy for the nazis overruled any scruples about the destructive force he was about to release on the world the argument was compelling if the germans got the bomb first they would be sure to use it for the americans who styled themselves as guardians of democracy it could conceivably act as a deterrent to unjust wars  a weapon of peace oppenheimer chose the location for the secret laboratories and testing grounds in the new mexico desert he assembled the scientists he needed for the project and brought it to fruition when the third reich collapsed but the japanese fought on work on the bomb continued the scientists created the weapon but its deployment was a matter for the politicians when harry truman dropped bombs on hiroshima then nagasaki on 6 and 9 august 1945 oppenheimer seems to have been stricken with guilt and remorse for what he had done although publically celebrated as the father of the abomb he used his influence to argue against the development of an even greater weapon the hbomb which was being promoted by his colleague edward teller benny safdie by 1954 when he sat before the security committee oppenheimers pacifism had made him a suspect figure among americas cold warriors this distrust was exploited by the devious strauss the third strand of this movie looks at strausss efforts to get himself confirmed by a senate committee as head of the atomic energy commission with his press secretary played by alden ehrenreich gradually teasing out the true nature of his bosss double game oppenheimer owes a huge part of its success to cillian murphys performance the irish actor who always seems to play supporting roles has relished the opportunity to step into the limelight and must now be in contention for an oscar his achievement is to portray oppenheimer not just as a haunted man but as a lifelong misfit whose intelligence set him apart from every peer group oppenheimer tells his communist friends he has read all three volumes of das kapital but found marxs arguments unconvincing he sees no reason why he shouldnt support just causes such as the spanish republic or unionism when there are obvious strategic reasons to stay away the place he loves most in the world is the new mexico desert but its here he produces the first nuclear explosion there is an intellectual arrogance to oppenheimer that infuriates his opponents and occasionally trips him up having taken on the task of building the bomb he has to front up and celebrate the strike on hiroshima while he is inwardly reeling at the magnitude of horror he has helped unleash he finds it difficult to defend himself against determined but dishonest opponents even as his angry wife kitty emily blunt urges him to act if oppenheimer is a philosopher amid the dirty realities of politics lewis strauss is a disciple of machiavelli robert downey jr is so good in this role one could almost forget all his past misdeeds on and off the screen the rest of the cast is a whos who of hollywood talent with figures such as kenneth branagh niels bohr tom conti albert einstein and gary oldman harry s truman being assigned minor but crucial parts its rare that a film manages to look at a figure as monumental as oppenheimer without caricaturing him as a hero or villain the scientist is in part the author of his downfall but also a victim of circumstances and outright conspiracy after spending three hours in his company we cant exactly approve or disapprove oppenheimer is a flawed genius who can grapple with the intricacies of quantum mechanics but cant resolve the moral dilemmas that plague his public and private lives he is a figure that invites the most dramatic comparisons not just as prometheus who stole fire from the gods but the man in the gospel of st mark who gains the whole world and loses his own soul
Sep 14 2023,positive,christopher nolans most stirring plea to humanity yet a threehour drama that plays like a terse thriller weaving nolans deepseated fears for the survival of our species through a biography of one of its most significant and controversial figures
Sep 12 2023,positive, robert angier wanted to perform the perfect magic trick dom cobb wanted to live his perfect dream literally joseph cooper wanted to find a perfect planet now christopher nolan has made a biopic on the man who wanted to create the perfect bomb but lets get this out of the way first does the films main event termed as a cinematic experience for the ages on imax live up to its almost unbearable expectations well yes and no  but the explosion in isolation just the trinity one nolan makes the divisive decision not to show the hiroshima and nagasaki bombings does not justify the hype as hairraising a visual achievement it may be instead the filmmaker completely goes for the jugular and paralyses us with shock in a scene right after when the father of the atomic bomb has to address a crowd of colleagues who are stomping their feet in rhythm cheering the attacks on the japanese cities a traumatised oppie as his friends call him  now in full realisation of the horrors he has unleashed upon the planet  stammers his way through what is meant to be a victory jaunt as he hallucinates the phantoms of his horrific creation that would change the course of history with help from composer ludwig göranssons anxietyinducing score cinematographer hoyte van hoytemas staggering use of 65millimeter film and editor jennifer lames frenetic frames nolan takes you deep into the mind and all its tragic machinations of a protagonist repelled by his own eminence and tortured by his futile attempt to advocate against further nuclear development his primary weapon of choice is cillian murphy who has been around forever but still remains strangely unseen except in nolans universe and his careerdefining turn as thomas shelby the irishman in the role of oppenheimer is a true casting coup one of many in the film with his gaunt face and haunting eyes tormenting you with every piercing gaze glance and grimace here hes magnetic in the role of the scientist who bent the world to his will and whim for decades until it finally stops revolving around him the physical resemblance notwithstanding murphy captures oppenheimers internal turmoil and external arrogance with some amount of immodest ease we never quite understand him fully but thats precisely what nolan wants  but oppenheimers sprawl both astounds and frustrates nolan of course complicates the chronology like only nolan can we are thrown headfirst into different timelines  that switch between dazzling colour and blackandwhite  representing both fission and fusion two terms the director uses right at the beginning of the film to indicate how energy is created and dissipated  from his beginnings in the 1920s as a genius student galvanized by the prospect of making breakthroughs in quantum mechanics to teaching and collaborating with other prodigious minds at berkeley to embracing the leftist ideals that would later invigorate him to develop the bomb ahead of the nazis nolan charts oppenheimers early days in linearenough fashion the dialogues and debates bristle with a kinetic sort of energy that is palpable and we remain invested in all the dizzying equations and exposition that should rightfully perplex but somehow make sense things then get heated oppenheimer quickly encounters a number of people who will have farreaching ramifications on his life such as nuclear physicist ernest lawrence josh hartnett well and truly owning his renaissance the stern but supportive lieutenant general leslie groves a fantasticasusual matt damon and the eventual hydrogen bomb inventor edward teller benny safdie in a bit of a hard sell hes also juggling the two women who make and nearly break him the incendiary psychiatrist and communist party member jean tatlock florence pugh with whom he has a steamy onandoff romance and his wife the boozy kitty a supremely disdainful emily blunt who surely deserved more screen time theres a revolving army of other supporting characters too  some fragmented some whole none streamlined  sportingly essayed by an array of stars that reads like a whos who list of hollywood royalty kenneth branagh as danish physicist niels bohr oppenheimers mentor gary oldman as president harry s truman naturally stealing the show with one of the best scenes set in the oval office after the bomb is dropped tom conti as a regretfully ponderous albert einstein  and rami malek in a small but frightfully important cameo it is robert downey jr though who emerges as the films most prominent gamechanger and the marvel superstar delivers the finest performance of his career as atomic energy commission chair lewis strauss who makes it his mission to dismantle oppenheimers credibility and service to the united states government if that sounds like a lot to take in it is but this is where nolan falters the straussoppenheimer rivalry fuelled by jealousy and humiliation spirals into a fullblown revenge saga in the second half primarily taking shape inside claustrophobic conference rooms populated with suits from being an enigmatic origin story about one of the most legendary scientific minds in history the film turns into partcourtroom battle partpolitical drama as nolan tries to or rather lets us decipher what oppenheimers future legacy will be it stifles more than it intrigues indeed one of the rare times you crack a wry smile is when some us officials are ascertaining which japanese cities to bomb and one of them comments that he removed kyoto from the list because his wife enjoyed their honeymoon there still the monumental world nolan creates often results in an immersive experience that is not often witnessed in biopics even if some stretches play out way too long oppenheimer constantly reminds us that everyone quickly

Sep 6 2023,positive, who was j robert oppenheimer according to the history books he was either a saviour or a devil and of course with his involvement in the development of the atomic bomb he was certainly the embodiment of his famous quote lifted from the bhagavadgita now i am become death the destroyer of worlds christopher nolans biopic oppenheimer posits oppenheimer cillian murphy as both and symbol and a man but despite its expansive runtime never gives a clear answer to who he was he remains enigmatic a sphynx as one character terms him genius dilletante womaniser madman egomaniac innovator  all these adjectives are used to describe him and all are correct yet even when nolan puts laser focus on the man and the myth we are still left wondering perhaps we are left wondering because nolan is actually not as interested in telling the audience about oppenheimer as he is with crafting a political thriller and a treatise on what mutually assured destruction looks like oppenheimer was playing a zerosum game from the moment he was recruited as head scientist for the manhattan project a fact that existed in the periphery of his understanding but never quite hit home until he finally delivered the bomb truman was intent on using despite the war being ostensibly over the film moves between timelines in oppenheimers life the young student who went to study in england who annoyed his professor patrick blackett james darcy and impressed niels bohr kenneth branagh the same young student would attempt to poison blackett give lectures in dutch  a language he learned in weeks shake the hand of werner heisenberg and develop a lifelong friendship with fellow jewish physicist isidor rabi an excellent david krumholtz all before returning to berkeley to set up the first quantum physics curriculum intercut with oppenheimers ostensibly linear story nolan rarely uses linear even when attempting linear is his troubled relationship with lewis strauss robert downey jr the commissioner of the united states atomic energy commission and the closed trial of oppenheimer in 1954 in which he tried to keep his revoked q clearance that had been taken from him under suspicion of communist activities during the mccarthy period nolan immerses the viewer in perspective by having oppenheimers life in colour and strauss machinations in black and white including his attempt to enter cabinet as a congressman nolan is a technical wizard one with a genius touch with his choices of cinematographers the inimitable hoyte van hoytema once again pairing with nolan production designers ruth de jong editors jennifer lame and composers ludwig göransson who scored tenet he is also a capable script writer yet somewhere in all this mastery is a small hollow oppenheimer is intensely humanistic melancholy enraged but not quite engaged dig through the film and cut some of the bloat and there is an astonishing piece of cinema the bloat caveat aside nolan has created as masterpiece intelligent and insightful the performances he elicits from murphy downey jr and emily blunt as kitty oppenheimer are marvellous supporting cast such as matt damon as lieutenant general leslie richard groves who brought oppenheimer on to the manhattan project benny safdie as rival scientist edward teller josh hartnett as the apolitical engineering scientist ernest lawrence and jason clarke as the prosecutor roger robb all give committed and elevated performances florence pugh as oppenheimers doomed erstwhile lover jean tatlock is perhaps least served by the film oppenheimers story is too dense to recount in a simple review so the key points of interest include his relationship with his unfulfilled and domestically resentful wife kitty who was a scientist in her own right whose affiliations with the communist party as well as those of jean tatlocks and roberts brother frank dylan arnold led him to be closely monitored for many years by the fbi oppenheimers brittle friendship with albert einstein played with great heartbreak by tom conti and of course his activities heading the manhattan project out of el paso the bulk of the film revolves around the race to make the bomb before the germans do something oppenheimer feels is his duty not only as an american but as a jewish american isidor rabi is reluctant to join the project because he does not want to see something as pure as theoretical physics being turned into a weapon its a subtle warning that oppenheimer does not heed at the time but one that will haunt him there is a plenitudinous number of discussions about uranium plutonium core reactions chain reactions arguments between scientists of many allied nations not russia all taking part in the race to beat the nazis some of this is discussion is necessary for a sense of verisimilitude of the scientific process and also needed to show how teller and oppenheimer became bitter rivals it does slow the pace of the film which is breakneck in other areas but once we reach the point of the trinity trial nolans exquisite mastery of form is on full display he manages to inject small doses of humour into one of the most nailbiting sequences in the film  richard feynman jack quaid sits in his car and insists the windscreen will absorb the uv rays teller lathers himself in sunscreen it all builds up to a crescendo where for the first time in the film nolan employs a moment of silence during the flash of the explosion where the real voice of oppenheimer speaks his famous line and then the most bone rattling boom in recent cinema the fact that the trial happened after the surrender of germany weighed slightly on oppenheimer and other scientists they thought they were building the bomb to defeat the nazis yet like the man addicted to seeing his experiment through oppenheimer steams ahead as soon as he has delivered the successful test he is cut out of the military loop and like everyone else in the world hears of the bombings of japan via trumans announcement on the radio nolan is clever enough to never show hiroshima or nagasaki and the aftermath instead there is a sequence where oppenheimer imagines he is stepping over burning bodies in a celebratory speech at los alamos nolan breaks with reality several times in the film and these are some of the best moments cillian murphy gives the performance of his life  his blue eyes bearing down into the camera filled with eternally conflicting emotions and sometimes lacking emotion altogether robert downey jr is easily giving his best dramatic performance since chaplin and emily blunt is spellbinding as pragmatic but troubled alcoholic kitty matt damons charm as an actor is used to every advantage as he plays off murphy alden ehrenreich is brilliant as an unnamed senate aide who pieces together strauss conspiracy against oppenheimer which was started by strauss being embarrassed by oppenheimers refusal to support the export of isotopes to foreign nations while strauss was head of the aec the vindictive pettiness of strauss is one of many factors that led to the slow downfall of an american hero the other was oppenheimers resistance to supporting the creation of hydrogen bombs because as he well knew the arms race with the soviet union was triggered and men have a way of ensuring that the weapons they create they use oppenheimer is sombre and electrifying dizzying and bloated a contradiction that never quite comes together but at the same time is one of nolans best and most political works to date with a cast that is stacked with talent not even mentioned are casey affleck dane dehaan remi malek david dastmalchian alex wolff matthew modine gary oldman and a premise that allows nolan to mix a certain level of intimate scale as well as spectacle with his material that was lacking in tenet and to an extent interstellar oppenheimer is a merger of what nolan does best as a director  even if the result is sometimes flawed who is j robert oppenheimer as albert einstein tells him that is not up to him  his legacy will always belong to whoever wants to claim it for whatever purpose it will serve nadine whitney

Sep 2 2023,positive, since the writerdirector burst onto the scene in 2000 with the neonoir memento those who like ambitious yarns and foreboding pushins have considered him a sure bet with each new release fans have claimed that the prestige the dark knight and dunkirk are nothing short of masterpieces while others cite the narrative geometry of inception and interstellar as their preferred brand of dense escapism yet all of them are anchored by showstopping visuals captured on celluloid and with minimal cgi making them optical stunners as well the true test of oppenheimer is whether nolan can maintain his typically mammoth vision with a narrative that mostly comprises white men talking in small rooms fittingly nolan succeeds in a grand and unexpectedly horrifying fashion  just like his protagonist per his own house style nolan doesnt tell oppenheimer in a linear fashion critics have called that a crutch in the past but in his best features theres always a reason for the structure in memento nolan wanted viewers to experience the unreliable memory of his protagonist by depriving them of established information in oppenheimer hes working at the intersection of time and space catching molecules middance explosions preflare and ultimately an entire life both assembling and blowing apart at the same time early on we find j robert oppenheimer cillian murphy fighting homesickness as he struggles abroad to complete his phd in physics he can tell times are changing for jewish people in europe but he also feels unwelcome because hes primarily interested in theory over laboratory work upon returning to the united states to lecture on the emerging field of quantum mechanics oppenheimer is approached by us army officer leslie groves matt damon who wants to name the physicist the director of the manhattan project suddenly a man who was always satisfied with conjecture alone is given a chance to fight the nazis by forcing theory into reality oppenheimers love life is integral to the proceedings as it fleshes out who he is as a person  an egoist philanderer whos never willing to give himself completely to one partner although his liaisons with communist jean tatlock florence pugh leave a mark its biologist katherine puening emily blunt whom he eventually marries despite her alcoholism and the grudge she carries for becoming a mother instead of an academic their embattled relationship isnt quite the centerpiece of the story but it serves as a deft fulcrum for the pivoting political drama if that werent enough oppenheimers quest to make the first successful atom bomb is intercut with blackandwhite sequences from years later that focus mostly on robert downey jrs lewis strauss a politician and the head of the atomic energy commission strauss tries to flatter oppenheimer into keeping america at the forefront of the arms race which may have worked before the destruction of hiroshima and nagasaki  but oppenheimer grew into a different mindset later arguing for deescalation to salve his conscience theres no doubt this is a packed movie watching oppenheimer is a bit like speedreading a history textbook except with great dialogue and a searing ludwig göransson score its truly surprising how few effects sequences nolan offers here he still shoots a good chunk of the film in 65mm imax but its most often deployed in bracing closeups the choice is subtle but effective murphy begins the film as a youthful neurotic emboldened by his own genius many of those early shots are in 35mm and traditional widescreen by the end our protagonist is hollowed to the core and having his gaunt features stretched four stories high in full imax ratio is all nolan needs to convey what is lost is there an oscar in it for murphy after delivering great work for decades this definitely feels like his time his performance is impressively livedin while never feeling like hes changing gears to evolve in the back half ditto for downey jr whos about as good here as hes ever been strauss is a complex man hes unquestionably a patriot but you never know where his true feelings end and his political ambitions begin top marks for damon and blunt as well who distinguish themselves against a certified murderers row of supporting talent in fact the sheer volume of the cast is the only potential problem here as some of the smaller roles end up being crucial to the narrative in the final hour of course nolan is upholding history to some degree and its true that some folks werent very close with oppenheimer and still were called to testify about him once the physicist began opposing hydrogen bomb research it just would have been nice to feel those puzzle pieces falling into place instead of trying to recall which fiveminute role a person played two hours ago despite that were still talking about one of the best and most riveting biopics in recent memory some will bemoan how nolan could have made a more conventional thriller that flexes the real fury of a mushroom cloud and gapes at cities flattened by fire but its the space between molecules that nolan is interested in like all the presidents men and zodiac before it this epic chronicle of american history is more about the before and the after the moments that birthed the revelations  the director should be prepared to weather criticisms that he focuses entirely on the men behind the bomb and not the victims of its devastation yet a scene showing a host of government officials confronted with the brutality of their efforts spells out nolans intent the camera is kept firmly on oppenheimer while his contemporaries react audibly to the horrors before their eyes here nolan has a perfect opportunity to show exactly what the manhattan project has wrought but instead we hear vivid descriptions of the japanese victims while staring at the man responsible  nolan isnt ignoring the lives destroyed he just doesnt want to dramatize them for the sake of pathos thats already in the movie the approach also drives a second layer of commentary where the film remains siloed in the myopic view of white men as even today thats how us decisionmakers experience the ravages they cause ultimately the film draws immense power from what it doesnt show  and still the fallout is palpable in every scene burning bright and never fading
Aug 29 2023,positive, not quite your standard biopic of j robert oppenheimer the father of the atomic bomb nolans latest casts slender irishman murphy as the titular scientist focusing his story around theoretical physicist oppenheimer and his work leading up to and following the successful creation of the first nuclear bomb nolan captures a portrait of a brilliant man who was often in conflict with his work and his own proclivities based on the 2005 pulitzer prizewinning book american prometheus the triumph and tragedy of j robert oppenheimer by kai bird and martin j sherwin oppenheimer looks at a life both inside and out of the manhattan project and his interactions with the various scientists students  politicos communists military generals and women he encountered over the years there has been much talk of oppenheimer being nolans best work comparing it to oliver stones jfk in terms of scale scope and conspiracy while i would argue that even an okay nolan film is still a good film as good as oppenheimer is it is simply is not his best id rather reserve that accolade for the mindbending inception or interstellar at his best however is murphy oppenheimer marks his third major role in a film for the director having previously appeared in dunkirk inception and as one of the main villains in batman begins and subsequent franchise cameos the actor convincingly spans oppenheimers life from young intellectual in a lab through to the weary man whose brilliance wrought the deaths of hundreds of thousands unleashing an awesome power that humanity perhaps should not hold murphy plays each iteration of oppenheimer well which is a must for an actor who is in virtually every scene of the films threehour runtime there is a lot of be said about the impressive ensemble of actors in nolans film to name just a few kenneth branagh matt damon robert downey jr florence pugh emily blunt benny safdie david krumholtz alden ehrenreich and dane dehaan quite obviously there are only two women in that cast list more or less a product of the scientific community of the era yes there are a few women and people of colour in science lectures classrooms and in the manhattan project but largely this is the story of white men pugh and blunt are the topbilled women with the former having only a small but pivotal role as an early one of oppenheimers lovers blunt has much more screentime but even she isnt given much to do as oppenheimers wife with a fondness for drinking though the entire ensemble operates as a welloiled machine it feels like distracting stunt casting equally disjointed is the timeline of the film which clocks in at threehours nolan has chosen to piece the film together out of chronological order sometimes whipping between pre and postbomb at a clip switching from colour to blackandwhite it doesnt make the narrative hard to follow but instead the frequent cutting doesnt give scenes enough time to breathe lessening their impact on the audience though decently wellpaced the climax of the film is undoubtedly the desert trinity test of the bomb capabilities which is a standout moment arriving at around the twohour mark what makes this whole sequence of events stand out is that nolan gives it time to build tension and unfold in front of the audience instead of timehopping to the next scene oppenheimer is definitely worth the price of admission to see it on the big screen it will undoubtedly be a player this awards season with murphy getting some welldeserved recognition but nolans best ill reserve that achievement for his future work 
Aug 26 2023,positive, christopher nolan is one of my favorite filmmakers his attention to detail tone acting production sets and sound is always a delight inception 2010 the dark knight2008 dunkirk 2017 and the dark knight rises2012 come to mind when i look back on his memorable films hes set the bar high for himself by tackling robert oppenheimers life as an experimental physicist who ended up creating the atomic bomb and taking the blame for its horrendous results his casting of cillian murphy known for peaky blinders british tv series 2013 was a brilliant choice as his nuanced performance is exceptional i enjoyed this historical film immensely and have forgiven its threehour runtime as to have an up close and personal look at history in the making is indeed a treat based on the 2005 pulitzer pricewinning biography american prometheus by kai bird and martin j sherwin the film unfolds in two separate ways the blackandwhite sections detail the past struggles of lewis strauss robert downey jr in a fantastic portrayal to be confirmed as secretary of commerce hes interrogated about his former support of oppenheimer who was controversial as of 1959 he would become the first candidate denied approval if his answers didnt satisfy the senate committee members we are privy to his constant badgering and the seriousness of his past actions the color sections show oppenheimers life most notably his torrid affair with communist party usa member jean tatlock florence pugh and his somewhat unsteady marriage to his wife kitty emily blunt the development of the atomic bomb is the main focus as well as his constant conflicts and alliances with manhattan project director leslie groves matt damon we also learn of the building of a town in los alamos new mexico where scientists will live and work while the bomb is perfected to test the bomb there eventually the color and black and white scenes are flashbacks simultaneously as oppenheimer is being interrogated by a special committee that will decide if his security clearance will be renewed yes this is a lot to take in a while viewing a film although soon the pace allows for settling in with expectations of the following scenes of course the cornerstone is the actual assembly and testing of the atomic bomb the supporting cast gives an incredible performance an almost unrecognizable robert downey jr as strauss departs from himself to totally embody his character florence pughs role as the needy yet unstable other woman is fascinating to view yes they have steamy love scenes although they are important as we begin to see the conflicted moral compass of a genius the total portrait of a human being he has his hands full appeasing his wife emily blunt as shes scored yet faithful filling her anger and jealousy with binge drinking her volatile yet loving relationship with oppenheimer is welldeveloped and intriguing to view nolan does achieve his goal of relentless tickingclock suspense in how he approaches the movie overall each scene is played for full dramatic effect especially in the race to build an abomb before nazi germany does when the final test occurs the sound is what stays with methe stopmotion of history before us is chilling in his spoton timing and visual effects look for an academy award for sound no other movie can top it as i have written and taught a unit of study of albert einstein and his contribution to the making of the atomic bomb i appreciated the indepth portrait of oppenheimer including his early beginnings in his college years we are privy to his psyche and his personality as nolan sets up scenes as if to dare us to predict how oppenheimer will react after three hours of viewing you will understand this person and his drive for success i can highly recommend it as youll learn a wealth of information while being artfully entertained
Aug 26 2023,positive, julius robert oppenheimer quoting from bhagavad gita made these words infamous when he uttered them the theoretical physicist became known as the father of the atomic bomb after being the director for the los alamos laboratory which assisted with the manhattan project under major general leslie groves during wwii the bombs created led to the destruction of hiroshima and nagasaki oppenheimer eventually feared the further creation and use of atomic weapons his stances and past associations with communist members led to the revocation of his security clearance staining his character for some  all of this and more is captured in christopher nolans 3hour biopic oppenheimer its a mostly brilliant occasionally exhausting picture that moves ten miles a minute and is filled with walltowall dialogue it is indeed nolans most talky film with the conversations often accompanied by ludwig göranssons rich but overused music score nolan frames the film with oppys security clearance meetings and a cabinet hearing for lewis strauss while detailing oppenheimers personal life and the manhattan project at the center the film covers a lot of ground but nolans intelligent writing based on the 2005 book american prometheus and jennifer lames precise editing help ameliorate the more convoluted sections  the cast of bigname stars is huge with the great cillian murphy leading the way as the title character his performance here ranks among his best as he shows oppenheimers struggles and successes expertly murphys eyes do a lot of acting while the others mouths are moving  matt damon plays groves with some humorous touches while emily blunt plays katherine oppenheimers alcoholic wife with fierceness florence pugh portrays jean tatlock who oppenheimer had an onagainoffagain relationship with robert downey jr dominates the last hour of the film as strauss turning in the most memorable supporting performance in the film the rest of the shiny cast includes  deep breath  josh hartnett casey affleck rami malek jason clarke kenneth branagh benny safdie jack quaid tom conti alden ehrenreich dane dehaan gary oldman and matthew modine just to name a few  being a nolan film the production aspects are very impressive oppenheimer was shot on imax 65 mm film by hoyte van hoytema and the film used little to no cgi according to nolan the images and practical effects are simply astounding at times especially during the trinity test scene the sound design during that section is expertly done too as silence is as important as the boom the subtle oldage makeup used throughout is also excellent  we hope youre enjoying brwc you should check us out on our social channels subscribe to our newsletter and tell your friends  brwc is short for battleroyalewithcheese
Aug 25 2023,positive, robert horton is a scarecrow board member and a longtime film critic he will be contributing a series of critics notes to the scarecrow bloga chance to highlight worthy films playing locally and connecting them to the riches of scarecrows collection in the threehour rush of oppenheimer writerdirector christopher nolan takes time to include an early scene of the title character gazing at a picasso the painting woman sitting with crossed arms 1937 deconstructs reality and reassembles it in a fresh way forcing us to think anew about its subject perhaps confronting us with an assertion that the old ways of seeing are not enough anymore or picasso echoes quantum physics by breaking the image apart and exposing it as a collection of pieces the nucleus no longer holds we dont know what is going on in the head of j robert oppenheimer cillian murphy as he gazes the film wants us to understand that jro responds to the fragmentation of early 20th century art citing also the waste land and stravinsky maybe he has the wistful yearning of a scientist who wishes he were an artist i suppose its too easy to pin this moment as autobiographical but after all nolan is a highly cerebral director of films that deconstruct cinema in clinical ways a noir told backward a world war ii story that evolves in parallel but inexact lines a story of manufactured dreams built like a nesting doll excited young cineastes like to call nolan this generations stanley kubrick but hes really david lean turned inside out a master of spectacle one who cant resist disassembling the pieces of the spectacle and pondering their individual parts and like lean the observations at the heart of the spectacle tend to be of the midbrow variety the new yorkers richard brody called oppenheimer a history channel movie a puzzling description of a relentlessly experimental project maybe brody was thinking of the films tendency to put its cinematic zest in service of some incorrigibly cornball moments what do we call the first atomic test let us call it  trinity or words to that portentous effect otherwise oppenheimer is shaped as an experience an onslaught of sound and image and ideas arranged musically although it has one very loud bomb going off halfway through most of it consists of people talking in rooms yet nolan presents the film as a roller coaster ride throbbing with ludwig göranssons scorewhich with nolans usual cavalier attitude toward dialogue comprehension thoroughly fuzzes what people are saying at various pointsand darting in and out of color do we learn much about j robert oppenheimer not really not biographically not spiritually this is not the fault of cillian murphy whose haunted eyes beneath the deftlydeployed hat were made for this kind of existentially conflicted role althoughand this is sheer historical prejudice on my parti could never get used to seeing oppenheimer as a short man the real oppenheimers lanky tallness had to have been part of his rather lofty dreamy personality oppenheimer is not a character study but a political film a look at the backandforth of government process from the building of the bomb to the securityclearance hearing that oppenheimer had to endure in the 1950s when his leftist sentiments made him suspect during the redbaiting era in its structurally bizarre final hour which crosscuts between oppenheimers security investigation and a later cabinetappointment hearing for oppie nemesis lewis strauss robert downey jr nolan gives us the american nightmare and a more upbeat example of justice being served however obscure strauss might now be as a historical figure on the latter point nolan is surely catching the zeitgeist feelingfantasy that something at long last might happen to the 45th us president something like accountability i dont doubt that the energetic whoosh with which nolan puts all this across is genuine excitement on his part about making these events come to cinematic life although they are also more than a little exhausting oppenheimer might be less taxing if its points werent so exactly and precisely worked out with nolan things are on the nose with only occasional spots of mystery and uncertainty like the brief dangerous intensity of florence pugh as oppenheimers sometime girlfriend or the suggestion from niels bohr kenneth branagh that oppie should metaphorically hear the music rather than just read notation even the films excursions into expressionism like a triumphal posthiroshima talk oppenheimer gives to his manhattan project colleagueswhere his cando words contrast with visions of melting faces and nightmare soundsare so carefully calculated that they have the exact meaning nolan wants them to have and nothing else nolans style tends to reduce things to a simple idea no matter how complicated his timearrangements or aspect ratios are being able to articulate exact meanings isnt a negligible talent and so the film is often engaging the room where the security hearing takes place is one of nolans best conceptions a weirdly cramped rectangular featureless chamber where the deck is stacked against the onetime american hero like the climactic scene in barbie between doll and inventor see i found a way to connect the two films the space is a pale sort of void a purgatory here oppenheimer will be grilled mostly by an atomic energy commission counsel played by jason clarke and defended macon blairsuch a human presenceis his attorney his wife emily blunt will hear him talk about infidelities and his wary military partner leslie groves matt damon will shun him as oppie sits off to the side disappearing in space the room is like one of those places in your dreams where the dimensions are wrong a recurring location of threat and confinement there is so much on the table in oppenheimer that nolans habit of settling for neat conclusions is especially disappointing it is a noble try an interesting experience and an absolutely fascinating example of the director as superstar a movie about a midcentury scientist had an 80 million opening weekend as to the postopeningweekend comments that the film glosses over the effects of the bombing of japan in favor of white man angst its tempting to say that those complaints are from people who didnt see the movie except that in this era you can actually see the movie and still bend it to your purpose no there is no documentary footage of hiroshima and yet oppenheimer is deliberate about conjuring horror during that aforementioned oppie victory speech theres a single tortured scream that cracks out of the audio mix a hallucination that justifies nolans complicated sound design it sears your brain i said these three hours are exhausting partly because they are so crammed with things but ultimately there is blunt power in those things equations hats screams
Aug 24 2023,positive, perhaps under slightly different circumstances this would not have quite as volatile of a reaction the announcement of two different disparate movies would have just been an odd curiosity rather than a cultural phenomenon that would capture the imagination of tens of thousands the juxtaposition was just too staggering in one corner of the world christopher nolans oppenhiemer his first movie in three years an epic threehour biopic about the creation of the atomic bomb an in the other corner greta gerwigs barbie a live action fever dream whose trailers and promotional material seem to belie any sort of tethering with anything wed ever known and both of these movies coming out on the same day july 21 was doubled marked from the get but for some myself included this cosmic alignment the cinematic syzygy meant only one thing an fantatical film run a double feature of the highest order i had done as an adult now the history books by which i mean the wikipedia article pormanteaued the names as barbenheimer a name i never quite agreed with because it did not reflect what i viewed the proper viewing order as i planned the grueling gauntlet i determined early on that the only correct approach would be to sit through the dark harrowing existentialism of nolans oppenhimer and then immediately go into bubblegum pop existentialism of gerwigs barbie as a form of culturalexperiential cold shock that would stagger me into an upswing it was a bit but a bit that i was committed to i began prosteylizing the work trying to rally others to the theater for the deed many scoffed at the thought but i convinced folks to undertake the journey that i felt my cause my crusade noble i sent word to my friends and associates the marketing tools made this very easy while i could not secure time to watch on the 21st the 22nd would work just the same a 1030 showing of oppenhiemer on the biggest screen i could find followed immediately by a 210 showing of barbie on a slightly smaller screen i must warn you of what comes next now there are spoilers in this text unknowable secrets that you could very well find knowable but if i am to talk of the oppenharbie i must be able to talk free of what i witnessed i managed to go in unadulterated with knowledge but that was because of the temporal proximity i imagine it might be more difficult now but i do not wish to contribute to the demystification if it can be helped as fate as demanded the dark magnum opus of christopher nolan and the fever dream that is live action barbie are coming out the same daythe bit i and thousands of others have made since this forbidden revelation is coming to fruition it is time to sit in a movie theater for six hours and be bombarded in several senses of the word i made the drive to the alamo drafthouse a relatively new fixture in my hometown the drive was uneventful and i walked into the theater with perhaps a tad bit of glee at the wild undertaking this particular alamo draftouse has an elaborate preshow so i sit in the massive theater the experience starts with footage from various atomic bomb psas times where we were informed that hiding under a desk could shield us from the effects of one of the worst weapons in human history this is immediately followed by a base level analysis of nolans entire library of works cataloging various trends like troubled protagonists and trends like memory and morality as i settled in the comfy recliner i put in an order for a breakfast blt which is like a regular blt but with an egg and fries its pricy but i figured that if there was ever a time to spend money it would be during a day where i am in a dark theater for upwards of six hours i see a few people rocking barbenheimer merchandise a couple outfits melding bright pink and drab grey i emboldened by having fellow travelers although i do wonder how many are actively foolish as i am the movie finally starts in typical nolan fashion the narrative isnt exactly linear we start with fission a polychromatic journey that follows cillian murphys oppenheimer and quickly are introduced to fusion a monochromatic political inquiry that follows robert downy jrs strauss many years after the creation of the bomb we bounce back and forth between these two eras that encircle a war happening off screen i learn a fair bit about oppenheimer during the movie his political leanings his womanizing tendencies his preference to theory it is the most exhilarating and harrowing story about scientists ive seen in a minute with a cast of staggering renown bringing the story to life all of it culminating to the test of the bomb nolan lets the explosion visual splendor revel in the silence the sound comes minutes later and the film barrels through the political aftermath that follows including a joke about kyoto narrowly avoiding destruction because someone had their honeymoon there the movies audiovisual bombardment leaves me emotionally raw there are no end credits or perhaps i was already living in the postcredits of a postnuclear globe so i tip my server collect myself and then immediately walk to the other theater the fugue state set in pretty much immediately as i settled into the second theater the server asks how im doing and i relay that i just watched oppenheimer i recollect how i have certainly made a decision as i order a brussels sprout bacon and goat cheese pizza this preshow features what i have to imagine is every single barbie commercial from the past 30 some years it culminates with an aggressive doll doing a psa about talking in the theater and im not ready for whats about to happen i noticed a few folks from the oppenhiemer showing although at this point im at hour three of sensory bombardment so i dont know if i can trust my senses especially since what happens next is barbie opens with the 2001 space odyssey spot and i thought that was an incredible ad spot when i first saw but to see it actually start the movie was something that shook me to my already shooketh core i settle in for the gauntlet of barbies mckinnon rae shipp mackey nef rooney kayne ayra gouglan narrative abela boynton and ken gosling liu benadir evans gatwa cena brydon stourton  i enjoyed seeing so many members of netflixs sex education that i actively wonder where asa butterfield is i enjoyed seeing america ferrera as a mattell employee and mom desperately missing her as amy from superstore will ferrell essentially reprising his roll from the lego movie is fine thats not really the point i watched michael ceras allan absolutely destroy kens in handtohand combat i burst out laughing as all the kens play a rousing rendition of matchbox twentys 90s classic push and the song creates a thousand new associations because of how it fits so perfectly and serves as a prelude to the other magnificent musical number the story is simple and sweet there is no room for deep nuance but there is nuance an acknowledgement of the contradictory standards an everlasting fear of never being enough and wanting more as the movie ends i smiled i also struggled to stand after being stationary for five and half hours out the last six  the sun was blinding as i exited the alamo drafthouse the summer heat was sweltering i walked slowly to my car and drive home in silence thinking of the dual existentialism films that i put in conversation with each other only to find a staggering amount of dialog of creation capitalism and human connection i got home and was stunned and in the fugue state voraciously needed something to snap me back to a more tethered state thankfully the universe provides and prime announced that ahead of the second season of invincible they released a special origin story for atomic eve i was mesmerized by the moment the sheer genius of releasing an episode of a pink haired protagonist with the ability to manipulating atoms the same day as oppenhiemerbarbie it was clear though that was i was a changed person experiencing oppenharbie had irrevocably changed me im not sure id say either was my favorite movie but i can say safely say it was one of the best cinematic experiences id ever done even got my own tshirt for it
Aug 24 2023,positive, in a way christopher nolans threehour shotinimax historical docudrama epic entitled oppenheimer isnt really about j robert oppenheimer at all yes even though its full of extreme closeups of the anguished scientist and much figurative rending of garments over his role in the creation of our modern world in which an atomic sword of damocles hangs over us all i mean obviously yes the film does focus on the theoretical physicist the man who led the united states secret program during world war ii to develop an atomic bomb cillian murphy a quiet place part ii the party as the scientist is mesmerizing conveying calamitous inner turmoil while remaining still and modulated on the surface even when his lack of apparent reaction damages him this can only be called a pointillistic portrait one full of staccato visuals that hit rapidfire but also somehow lazily not least as nolan switches from often intensely hued  indeed fiery hued  color images depicting oppenheimers subjective experience of his life and work to cooler calmer blackandwhite to show the external more objective reality in which he operates theres a lot going on in this film on so many levels but i suspect entire theses will be written alone about the distinction nolan makes here between personal emotional and intellectual experience as more vivid to the individual obviously versus the drier more distant more neutral impartiality of everything outside of ourselves and the limits of that too since it can only be cast through subjective eyes such as those of a filmmaker or a historian this movie is a darker grimmer filmstockflipped wizard of oz and way more existential dreaminess turned deadly actuality not that oz didnt have its own grimdark existentialism of course nolan tenet dunkirk casts oppenheimer as a man possessed by preternatural visions of the subatomic world a strange reality that the mathematics says must exist but which he can see only in his imagination and this is one of nolans startling uses of imax weve been trained to expect that imax pictures will capture the bigness of the world but nolan goes in the opposite direction here zigzagging dots trailing light on the biggest movie screen we have suggesting the unfathomably minuscule realm far beneath our awareness its like a buzzing in your ear of the universes tiniest unseen insects hounding you to accept them even as you cannot comprehend them nolan does go big with his pictures too his incredibly brief yet horrifyingly riveting impression of one worry that dogs the atomic scientists  would a runaway atomic reaction set off by a successful bomb ignite the planets atmosphere and jesus fucking christ they went ahead with it anyway  is perhaps the imagery that haunts me the most from the movie yet as much as nolans oppenheimer is very much stuck in his own head he can also be thoughtless and impulsive giving in to urges without considering the consequences of them from an itch to poison what yup a professor when he was at cambridge university to an illadvised sexual situationship with a fellow pseudocommunist florence pugh goddess black widow little women in the prewar years to a momentary lapse into wearing a military uniform that does not suit him in any way in the early days of the manhattan project nolans oppenheimer can be very selfinvolved to the point where you kinda wanna smack him out of it which his wife played by a caustic emily blunt jungle cruise a quiet place part ii as a brilliant woman underappreciated by the world almost literally does ironically or perhaps not given his track record nolan underappreciates her character and the actress as well it comes in a moment where oppenheimer is castigating himself for being frankly a huge jerk and suffering the consequences of this  in a personal capacity not a militaryindustrialscientificcomplex one  and its almost the thematic centerpoint of the film its echoed later when in an astonishing onescene cameo gary oldman the hitmans wifes bodyguard darkest hour as us president harry truman berates the physicist as a crybaby for feeling as if he had blood on his hands after hiroshima truman was the one who dropped the bombs after all oppenheimer only made the bombs there is a paradox at the nucleus of oppenheimer i dont think nolan has any intention of suggesting that oppenheimer shouldnt have felt guilty or responsible for what his work led to it is and would be only human for him for anyone to do so indeed ludwig göranssons creed ii black panther aggressive score and the films relentlessly belligerent sound design not to mention the overwhelming impact of the imax visuals that are both intimate and epic ensure that we feel in a visceral way how tormented oppenheimer is and yet the film projects what could be seen as at worst disdain for oppenheimers pitypoorme martyrdom at best oppenheimer is dismissive of the notion which the man himself as depicted here seems to hold that oppenheimer is solely to blame for the horrors that his atomicbomb project unleashed because once the possibility of an atomic bomb was conceived of someone was going to make it happen certainly in the context of world war ii the whole point of the manhattan project was to build a bomb before the nazis did the deeper question of why we seem as a species constitutionally driven to find the most violent most destructive uses of our scientific knowledge is a philosophical conundrum for another film trumans point is well taken no matter who built the bomb it would be and was the politicians who decided when where and how to deploy it and boy howdy the character who represents that side of the equation is a doozy although much in the same way that the film isnt really about oppenheimer its also not really about this other major figure either lewis strauss a former as of 1959 the presentday of the film atomic energy commission head vying for a seat in us president eisenhowers cabinet the film is structured as a series of nested flashbacks around strausss confirmation hearings in the us senate which involve oppenheimer because of the publicly and politically contentious professional relationship the men shared robert downey jr avengers endgame the judge in his finest and most interesting performance since before marvel plays strauss as a shallow grasping functionary unaware of how absolutely useless he is a contrast to oppenheimers profound intellectualism but also a complement to the scientists selfinvolvement strauss is just as focused on himself as oppenheimer is if with far less selfawareness about it nolan mines extraordinary suspense from a simple exchange between oppenheimer and albert einstein tom conti paddington 2 the dark knight rises that strauss witnesses but cannot overhear during which strauss believes oppenheimer must have said something that soured einstein on strauss because everything went to shit for strauss after that and what other reason could there be this leads directly to one of the many tiny unsettling zingers of the film a bit of snark from alden ehrenreichs solo a star wars story hail caesar aide to strauss about that mysterious exchange such an amazing ensemble cast in this film entire theses will be written about that too when we at last hear that conversation  this final flashback is the closing scene of the film  its shocking for what is said and also for what isnt its here when what oppenheimer is about hits hard and it is once again paradoxical with the power to destroy ourselves unleashed  not just nukes but global warming possibly ai maybe genetic engineering probably lots of other potential nightmares  how such awesome capability is used goes far beyond the acts of any one person even the selfcentered selfinvolved men who think they make the world go round and yet when enough of them get together even in opposition to one another the tragedy is that they might actually make the world stop really well written review of the amazing and clearly oscar worthy oppenheimer there is however one glaring oversight and that is the main deleterious motivation behind the creation of the bomb and that is  male hubris i think this is truly the kingpin of this movie men cannot create life so they get off on destroying it this is what all these male scientists in an almost collective orgasm demonstrate when the first bomb trial goes off it is so hard to watch there is only a brief view of two people throwing up but all the others are simply in a state of euphoria the few women his lovers in the film are the only ones that seem to fully comprehend the human ramifications all the others just see male glory and male power the male hubris at the basis of this destruction always has calamitous ramifications as einstein so clearly states in the last scene we are all doomed id offer that the problem at its heart is capitalism the military industrial complex and on a more big picture scale the problem is our societys constant aspirations for affluence both men and women in my experience put a good life in material terms far ahead of any concern about consequences like climate change or nuclear war if particular men bear the blame for specific actions thats one thing but our species does not seem to know restraint regardless of gender  consider how julian assange and edward snowden are men but hillary clinton was quite happy to see them prosecuted and the military industrial complex enriched during her time as secretary of state the us govt bureaucracy doesnt care whether its biden or harris or obama as the figurehead just that american financial political and military dominance across the world is maintained thats really what this animosity towards china and russia and the conflict and sanctions thats resulted is about when i saw the trailer for oppenheimer i immediately thought of its timing during the ukraine war and potential for nato vs russian conflict theres very little if any discussion in the media about peace negotiations and ending the conflict do you ever wonder why that is the us militaryindustrial complex consumes about 1 trillion half of federal discretionary spending and it would be fine with a forever war of the models of iraq and afghanistan war is a business and politics is the business of power of which war and weapon making is a part living in europe i can assure you that there are many many reasons for the lack of peace negotiations a prominent one is that the russian government would not accept them unless ukraine surrenders completely  nor would ukraine for obvious reasons unless the russian notion changes completely there will be no end of the conflict and with ukraine being harrassed like that by now there is no certainty the war would end even if russia retreated from my point of view with some of us having the russians literally at our doorstep should ukraine lose the war there are still many people in europe who dont want negotiations on russian terms either even though i completely agree with you with respect to the us military industrial complex  the war in ukraine still is one in which the us have no say about whether to end it or not or in other words the us military industrial complex is not the only instance in the world waging war on someone even if they lost interest in this conflict completely fighting would ensue ad the parties involved have their own agenda each marge i have to respectfully disagree theres much evidence showing russias desire for peace negotiations in april 2022 just a month into the fighting there were peace talks in turkey that ended after uks boris johnson visited zelensky an agreement was being reached at that time russias main demand is that ukraine be neutral not part of nato but ukraine is repeatedly promised nato membership  if you believe russia is the threat not the us i have to respect that i would ask to you consider how honest mainstream media is and also the history of the maidan revolution 2014 the minsk agreements to stop civil war in the donbas and us involvement in that it is not an accident biden and his son hunter are implicated in a corruption scandal with burisma a ukrainian natural gas corporation also consider why were the nord stream pipelines bombed europe now has to depend partly on expensive liquid natural gas from the us and german industry is relocating outside the country europe is being deindustrialized by the loss of nord stream russia in partnership with europe and china represents an economic union that the us wanted to eliminate oh dear i feel like now i understand why caitlin johnstone speaks to you russias desire for peace negotiations russia invaded a sovereign nation if russia wants peace it can withdraw from the sovereign nation it invaded in fairness i mentioned caitlin more for her few articles dealing with existential crises while not closing ourselves off to the worlds beauty my views on russia are different shaped by my knowledge of the maidan the 2015 civil war in the donbas and us foreign policy libya syria yemen ukraine etc and not mainstream media great review maryann  i specifically like you pointing out the use of imax to go small instead of go big early in the film oppenheimer i think when hes trying to convince josh hartnett  what a cast indeed  to join him says something like we know the nazis are going to build it so we have to do it first its the only choice a sentiment you have highlighted i was just vibrating in my seat wanting to yell at them no you dont have to it would be enough to keep them from doing it and i think the film while really doing an incredibly moving job of grappling with oppenheimers conflicted feelings about the bombs use never quite grapples with that conclusion being a foregone one that said i thought this film was more or less magnificent and appreciate your writing on it oh heavens i havent the slightest clue if they knew it was happening and they knew where which i think they did i struggle to think they could not have spent at least some effort on trying to disrupt the progress rather than make it a race this is idealistic and pacifistic of me and i know but heavens do i wish deescalation was a more valued trait throughout american history and culture at the top of the comments section click on subscribe and then you can choose whether you want to be notified of all new comments or only replies to your own comments theres a whole discussion about how hes not a member of the party etc i cant recall now why i included tatlock in that description  isnt there also some talk about how she wasnt as committed as she might be the quibble is that jean tatlock wasnt a pseudocommunist  unlike oppenheimer she was a an active committed member of the party  unlike oppenheimers wife kitty or his brother frank she never left it the more substantial comment is that strauss shouldnt be dismissed as merely a shallow grasping functionary  he was a talented man who had worked for herbert hoover in the emergency food relief program after world war i turned that into a job as an investment banker and made a fortune on wall street before and during the depression  he was a reserve navy officer who oversaw all war production for the navy department in world war ii and wound up an admiral  though a republican harry truman put him on the atomic energy commission  ambitious and insecure strauss was smart enough to recognize men who were smarter and he longed to be recognized as one of them  like salieri his dramatic equivalent or like nixon he was a b striver who desperately wanted to be an a and envied and resented men of genius who achieved effortlessly what he could never attain through sweat and cunning
Aug 23 2023,positive,cillian murphy did a fantastic job with his portrayal of dr oppenheimer not only did he resemble dr oppenheimer he was able to capture all of the fear and torment with his facial expression alone christopher nolan truly brought filmmaking up a notch
Aug 22 2023,positive, oppenheimer is so stuffed  with historic information bluechip actors and cinematic techniques  you wonder if it even belongs in the same breath as other films released this year in the biography of j robert oppenheimer the father of the atomic bomb he details the distractions the physicist had from multiple sources as he worked to unlock the weapons secrets oppenheimer played with great poise by cillian murphy didnt just have political opponents he had nagging insiders who could have spilled the secrets to any number of enemies keeping a lid on the build dubbed the manhattan project was often the least of his worries on the homefront he had a feisty forthright wife emily blunt and a needy mistress florence pugh who had the ability to steal his focus in the hastily built los alamos where scientists were united to craft the bomb he had a deadlinecrazy general matt damon and a phalanx of experts who demanded his attention murphy handles it skillfully damon isnt quite as controlled and gets his project underway then its a matter of ensuring it wont destroy those creating it throughout the mission nolan switches to scenes with robert downey jr as lewis strauss chair of the united states atomic energy commission nominated for a cabinet post strauss tries to sully oppenheimers reputation in order to build his own shot in blackandwhite the hearing and confirmation scenes represent the dismantling of oppenheimer the color shots show what happened outside the process folded into all of it of course is the thought that the man could be a communist working for interests other than the united states the witch hunt ties nicely with the statements nolan makes about politics and its role in the arms race oppenheimer talks with albert einstein tom conti at one point and learns what he has to lose its a telling scene that confirms games have always been played in washington when oppenheimer and company test their bomb nolan builds tension by using sound and light to underscore the moment step by step you witness areas where the film could be the leading contender for academy awards there are so many supporting actors of note its like an indie directors dream team youll wonder who will emerge from the pack downey is obviously a standout  at times its impossible to recognize him under the makeup and gestures  but there are also smart turns from alden ehrenreich dylan arnold and damon subtly we see oppenheimer age the makeup effects are firstrate aiding murphy in his process while he isnt a flashy actor murphy displays plenty of emotion on his gaunt face its not difficult to see the wheels turning when hes greeted by his team following its victory life becomes a blur like the bomb theres plenty of flash indistinguishable sound and a sense of dread like the candidate the moment has an oh no what have i done feel if you removed all the daredevil stunts tom cruise does in mission impossible  dead reckoning part one youd have a nifty little 90minute film
Aug 18 2023,negative,i find the last third of this movie to be interesting and the first twothirds to be long and at times not understandable
Aug 16 2023,positive, much like barbie theres probably not a ton to be said about oppenheimer at this point except to say that its every bit as good as people are saying still im going to take a run at it what stands out most about oppenheimer is how much its both very much a christopher nolan film and quite a radical departure for him yes loads of the old nolan tropes are present and accounted for multiple timelines an epic scope trouble writing female characters practical effects shot on imax cameras a booming and intentionally overstuffed soundtrack and of course cillian murphy finally taking centre stage  on the other hand its a fairly straightforward film thats very much a mix of pure biopic and essentially courtroom drama that consists mostly of people talking in rooms and by people i do mostly mean men  this was the 1940s after all its a huge film designed to be watched in imax as i did but its actually a very intimate tale arguably the first character study that nolan has ever done and yes its also the first of his films to feature nudity and or sex but its a sex scene as only christopher nolan would do it as midcoitus florence pughs character dismounts to pick up a book written in sanskrit and incorporates it into the action  with the immortal words i am become death destroyer of worlds acting as basically the um climax of the scene either way some may miss the nolanness of nolans latest film but after the undeniably creative but ultimately crushingly disappointing tenet going back to basics was a move that very much paid off not that he needed to go too far as the film that preceded tenet was the historical war film dunkirk even then though dunkirk still shared a certain coldness to it a lack of interest in its characters that prevented me from ever coming close to loving it unsurprisingly oppenheimer has a ludicrously impressive cast with yet another familiar face popping up every few minutes but crucially even the smallest parts  and there are loads of small parts  have enough character to them that you understand why so many stars and excellent character actors showed up even just for a couple of minutes of screen time and after playing pretty much no one but tony stark for a decade its a real pleasure to see robert downey jr get the chance to really cut loose here and remind us how great and versatile an actor he really is even the films two main female characters make a serious impact with their limited screen time and undeniably thinly drawn characters all joking aside though i do understand why people view florence pugh spending much of her screentime in the buff as purely gratuitous it seems pretty apparent to me that this was done to draw a contrast between oppenheimers two loves and yes this is a cheat but it does genuinely put pughs characters emotional rawness in stark contrast to emily blunts characters literally buttonedup stoicism  no matter how great the supporting cast are though this film belongs entirely to the eponymous robert oppenheimer and to cillian murphys spectacular suretobeawardwinning performance of this enormously complex historical giant aside for peaky blinders he has spent much of the past decade in small supporting roles so theres something particularly gratifying about his performance here which is in part pure leadingman charisma and in part nuanced and deep characteracting this is a historical drama about the development of the atomic bomb certainly but more than anything its about what being the driving force behind the weapons that would kill thousands in nagasaki and hiroshima and set the groundwork for a potential nuclear holocaust would do to the psyche of its creator especially because there is such a convincing argument that it was a necessary evil to prevent germany from build its own atomic bomb and to finally and definitively defeat a japan unwilling to surrender the war  or at least so it seemed at the time 
Aug 15 2023,positive, biographical drama starring cillian murphy and emily blunt during the second world war american physicist j robert oppenheimer and fellow scientists race against time to develop an atomic bomb before the nazis but during the 1950s red scare his name is dragged through the mud by us officials
Aug 11 2023,positive, finished the 2023 edition of fantasia festival with fifteen titles of varying success only two really didnt work for me river was my favorite aporia and with love and a major organ follow closely behind all in all another great dive into genre films with a festival that never disappoints i also finally caught up to oppenheimer a great feat albeit probably not a top ten feature for me figured itd be the first of the barbenheimer behemoth to be pulled from screens due to its runtime so heres hoping i can catch barbie in the next couple weeks too time will be tight though as tiff is coming right around the corner already received my first screener despite the full schedule not being released until 815 when tragedy strikes the osawa family on a day marked for celebration neither taeko fumino kimura nor jirô kento nagayama quite knows what to do they should be able to grieve together they should be able to look into each others eyes and yet they simply stare off into the distance going through motions as numb hollow husks searching for some sign of life while trying to avoid showing too much because its difficult to know exactly where they stand despite being married for a year now they still find themselves at a distance due to the circumstances surrounding their relationship taeko was married once before and had a sixyearold son tetta shimadas keita before park atom sunada ran away jirô was engaged to hirona yamazakis yamazaki when he began his affair with her add the fact that his parents misuzu kannos myoe and especially tomorô taguchis makoto cant quite wrap their heads around their son marrying a divorcee and forcing them to be grandparents to a grandchild that isnt theirs and you can begin to see how fragile things already were in another filmmakers hands love life would probably be full of fireworks as this married couple comes to grips with what happened by distancing themselves even further while moving closer to those former loves from their pasts this would probably be the case if it was set in many places besides japan too but thats what makes kôji fukadas drama so powerful the silences where steely frustrations and unavoidable embarrassment are left unsaid really speak to the struggle these characters face moving forward because everything intimated and refuted about their love does exist and how they react to those truths could shatter everything theyve built so dont expect things to get blown out of proportion dont assume park or yamazaki are going to use the situation to get back together with taeko and jirô respectively jealousy isnt what fukada is interested in pursuing hes focusing upon forgiveness instead not for the others transgressions or unspoken feelings but for themselves can taeko forgive herself for stopping to look for park can jirô forgive himself for breaking yamazakis heart can their shared nightmarish plight get makoto and myoe to finally realize the pettiness of their cold shoulder to support the family given to them rather than lament the loss of the one they always wanted and theres the need to forgive themselves for the spark to this emotional upheaval taeko blames herself jirô feels guilty for selfishly breathing a sigh of relief when he should have been mourning the circumstances are obviously heightened but the result is a resonant and universal sense of what living with and loving someone else entails its never easy its always complicated and you will ultimately make mistakes but the thing you cannot do is run from the inevitable fallout or avoid the truths that exist in your heart because its not about what you did to let shame prevent you from looking your partner in the eyes its about looking there anyway kimura shines in the lead role her strength to call out jirôs father when he goes too far or push park for answers when he suddenly comes back into her life mixes with a justified anger for having to deal with both at all that provides a palpable baseline for who she is and the decisions shell soon make because taeko will do anything for the people she loves she doesnt absorb these slights for herself but to protect those who are inevitably caught in the crossfire through no fault of their own keita as a symbol of her former marriage park as a deaf korean immigrant etc its a commendable feature of her love and an unfortunate opening that leaves her vulnerable the film is a series of events wherein taeko and jirô are let down by each other and themselves its about the ways in which they contort themselves so as not to actually talk about what has happened or what theyre truly feelingleaving them susceptible to being hurt further by the need to fill in the blanks conjuring their own assumptions instead they turn away rather than towards to confront their fears elsewhere leaving their genuine love in a purgatory that may never relinquish it the question is therefore whether they can remember theyre no longer alone its a tale of two trials except of course that neither half is a triala fact those presiding over both events are quick to stipulate whenever the accused or party at threat of being denied dares to call their tactics out for being unjust one sees j robert oppenheimer cillian murphy appealing the revocation of his security clearance years after stewarding the invention of the atomic bomb the other finds admiral lewis strauss robert downey jr seeking a cabinet appointment both prove that even the most cautiously optimistic belief that any nation on earth might handle the responsibility of nuclear power was simply naïveté thats what christopher nolans oppenheimer adapted from the book american prometheus by kai bird and martin sherwin is really about not how the titular character changed the world in los alamos not his life as a womanizing prophet of theoretical quantum physics no its about the reality that the bomb was a symptom albeit much more than that to those impacted at hiroshima and nagasaki of the prevailing international military industrial complex rather than its catalyst what should have been a deterrent to war merely became the next tool to ensure wed never see a period of time without a war raging again its a sobering thought that ultimately haunts oppenheimer from the moment we first meet him out of time there he is as a student at princeton unable to sleep with the sound and fury of death and destruction roiling through his brain there he is at a table in a tiny room being grilled by an overzealous prosecutor jason clarkes roger robb at the behest of an impartial tribunal unable to fully hear his words above the sensorial overload of terror for what his science wrought but none of that is present to earn sympathy from us or to prove an admission of guilt its a deflection from whats really going on a reminder that intent is meaningless in the face of ambition because the truth of what nolan weaves through flashbacks sparked by the testimonies of both oppenheimer and strauss is that its all been a game those who believe themselves to be in control are merely puppets for the ones who are the difference is that oppenheimer acknowledges this fact he knows admiral groves matt damon picked him because he was a liability because he had everything to lose and thus one hand perpetually tied behind his back he may have been arrogant but he wasnt vain not like straussa man so wrapped up in the strings hes pulling that he forgets about the ones tightly affixed to his own wrists at three hours long however we arent able to fully grasp this notion until were already twothirds of the way through thanks to surprise revelations that prove cuter than they do profound does shielding the real reason nolan has chosen these mirrored trials add anything to the whole no the impact of what we watch beforehand doesnt grow out of the reveal only the impact of what follows does so why not play it straight from the beginning why toy with the audiences expectations because that which does follow pales in comparison to the rest it serves to create a villain and in so doing removes us from the weight of oppenheimers grief to enjoy a romp of karmic justice instead dont get me wrong though downey jr is absolutely fantastic and i love his more direct plot line to an eventual comeuppance im just not sure it doesnt take away from the potency of the more introspective and esoteric prometheus tale at the films center thats why i must step back and view the whole as being about more than these men to see nolans goal as proving they were both pawns to a changing tide of bloodlust and tribalism wherein world war ii became less about finding allies to fight for a common cause and more about aligning with enemies to cheat steal and cut loose once the bigger threat to both was defeated thats where the communist angle comes in and why all those tertiary characters including florence pugh drastically underused jean tatlock must be introduced despite being throwaways who cannot earn the emotional gutpunch nolan wishes they can jean the chevaliers even oppenheimers brother are pawns to his story like hes a pawn to that of the united states demand for supremacy it all becomes fodder for roger rob to wield as ludwig göranssons score ramps up to climax so much so that even the wonderful scene where he gets taken to task by emily blunts kitty an actor elevating another weakly written prop to almost feel real becomes a victim to nolans toosmartforhisowngood shell game thankfully despite my qualms with nolan purposefully structuring things to exploit our belief hes finally told a straightforward story i was still completely taken by its gravitas give murphy and downey jr oscars check my blood pressure after the latest ptsdfueled flashback hits oppenheimer while he attempts to be what is wanted of him even as he wishes to retreat bask in the narrative parallels by looking back to see where the manipulations were coming from even if the need to do so feels unnecessarily convoluted much like my reaction to paul thomas andersons there will be blood oppenheimer is objectively a monumental work by an artist at the peak of his ability i just prefer nolans messier swings wherein heart and excitement trump his obvious technical prowess ryland brickson cole tews and mike chesliks lake michigan monster earned its cult following with a diy aesthetic and madcap absurdity that i respected more than i enjoyed it was fun a title id recommend being seen by those who already have an inclination rather than one id enthusiastically demand be viewed sight unseen so i wont lie and say i didnt approach their followup hundreds of beavers with slight trepidation or that my discovering it was a whooping 108minutes long didnt make me cringe at the thought of going comatose once the joke went stale but while this liveaction looney tunes epic of silentera slapstick nonsense is definitely too long i admittedly took a critical break around the hour mark it proves itself to be a vast improvement over its predecessor by fully leaning into the madness until you cant help reveling in its charm the story follows a hapless apple whiskey purveyor named jean kayak tews who gets too sloshed on his own wares to realize an influx of beavers have been munching on every piece of wood in the forest fastforward to the third verse of the opening song and jean finds himself destitute and dry in the freezing cold his apple trees and distillery burnt to a crisp a few circuitous gags later whereby he attempts to keep warm and find food puts jean onto the trail of a master trapper wes tank a cantankerous shopkeeper doug mancheski his furrier daughter olivia graves and a native trader luis rico gleaning what he can from their comings and goings he eventually becomes a trapper himself with dreams of killing enough rabbits beavers and wolves to buy a good coat get his own rifle and marry the only woman in this war zone of conniving creatures regardless of her father loathing his very existence cheslik who directs and tews who cowrites with him pretty much put forth a series of skits wherein jean is brutalized by his wouldbe animal victims in ways that teach him how to later brutalize them instead he uses that unintentional education to lay the foundation for a rube goldbergesque master plan of food pyramid violence that he knows can win him his prize and all the while the beavers continue building a bunker that houses dastardly plans of their own its a humorous ride in lofi yet impeccably crafted compositing between live action and animation for quickwitted roadrunner and wile e coyote actionwith a few bugs bunny versus elmer fudd shenanigans thrown in mostly silent besides grunting the scenes between humans namely jean the furrier and her father homage chaplinkeaton antics while the decision to have all the animals played by people in mascot costumes lends a surreally inspired dynamic of nightmarishly comic proportions that it all leads to a finale you cannot even begin to imagine is both its best and worst feature because despite it making the ride worth any pacing bumps it also reveals just how berserk things could have gone much much sooner yes the ways in which jean and the animals attack each other escalate in their idiocy as time passes but its still just them tryingfailing to kill each other again and again those first twothirds desperately need more variety and wtf details like a beaver sherlock and watson setting up whats coming with intent and a much defter hand than you might assume while watching only matters if your audience remains awake for the payoff if not for my makeshift intermission i might not have been but im glad i was since its conclusion really is unforgettable elsa sonya walger has als diagnosed six months ago her symptoms have reached the point of affecting her joba job thats intentionally shrouded in secrecy at the start of john rosmans new life we glean details sparse apartment handgun and tony amendolas mysterious handler raymond visiting with a new assignment though and conclude shes either a cia operative or assassin despite it not really mattering it should matter the fact it doesnt is the main reason i could never let the story wash over me and the core of why it fails to live up to its potential because although the movie is very much elsas story she isnt the lead shes neither the first person we meet nor the presumed protagonist we are conversely conditioned to hope she fails so suddenly pushing her into the hero role halfway through ultimately destroyed what was left of my good will not because she shouldnt be the hero or that her trajectory doesnt illustrate the overall message rosman is trying to convey but because he undercuts the effectiveness and necessity of both to facilitate an empty twist we meet jessica hayley erin first instead distraught covered in blood and running for her life towards home she washes up finds a change of clothes and discovers the engagement ring her boyfriend never gave her before realizing two men with guns have entered the house escaping through a window she finds herself stowing away in the backs of strangers cars eventually meeting a kindly older couple willing to help the assumption we make as well as anyone who encounters her and her black eye is that jessica is on the run from violence that she cannot divulge too many details because trusting the wrong person could be the difference between life and death add elsas activation on her crosscut parallel pursuit and we presume its true jessica either did something or saw something that a deeppocketed entity cant let become public knowledge so she becomes our focus she becomes the character we pull for regardless of elsas own tragic backstory flipping the script doesnt therefore excite us it frustrates i dont want to give too much away so ill try to keep plot specifics to a minimum beyond admitting jessica is a macguffin it doesnt matter that we spend twothirds of the runtime following her isolated path or that the film asks us to sympathize with her plight her true purpose is to set elsas wheels in motion how can you not then wonder what might have been if rosman simply let that be the case what if he wrote this script as elsas story wherein jessica is merely her current case instead of pretending as though her existence is on the same level of importance first i dont think it fundamentally changes a thing when looking back with hindsight maybe the first half isnt as mysterious as it is now but the second half wouldnt be nearly as manipulative either because we would know where we stand with the characters we would give elsa our weight and jessica our pity the latter can still have pathos her progress can still be about not taking life for granted it would simply transparently do so for the benefit of the former because we also dont know what movie were in due to the subterfuge not truly new lifes start and finish are on completely different wavelengths yes its cool and superficially effective but it proves to be for naught the second that shift undermines the overall package its too bad too since the much more horrorinfused second half is memorable in its thrills and special effects its also a shame because walger delivers a fantastic performance that deserves more time and intent to let its third act revelations breathe and earn its emotional gravitasgravitas the filmmaking thinks it has already i get the desire to make things more complex and twisty but the script needs to be airtight for such devices to truly excel it cant make you feel as though it led you on only to provide a gotcha that renders more of what weve seen inconsequential than it augments theres an intriguing concept here as far as using the idea that als is like being a prisoner in ones own body thats a thought that justifiably conjures fear especially for those who dont need to accept the reality themselves i just think the finished product uses it as a gimmick rather than a lesson as the current climate evolves into increased violence the future setting of robert hlozs restore point delivers a solution its a technology that provides a way to revive those whose time to die was forced upon them by another as long as you remember to download a backup of your consciousness and memories the taxpayerfunded institute led by dr rohan karel dobrý can bring you back his machine restores your body of its wounds before uploading your save file allowing you to continue your life with nothing but a few hours of blank space the crucial catch to screenwriters tomislav cecka and zdenek jecelins plot is that rohan cannot legally use any backups more than fortyeighthours old thats the cutoff point for rejection think of the raw data of your mind as an organ being transplanted into your body it will always be younger than its host and thus an anomalous intrusion to be fought against so you must be diligent you must always remember to upload just in case and dont forget one persons grace period to allow themselves the oft bout of forgetfulness or laziness is anothers loophole those fortyeight hours separate salvation from absolute death we learn about this duality from a lone wolf detective who knows it all too well em trochinowskas andrea mohylová husband was killed by a terrorist organization seeking to free humanity from the prison of statesanctioned immortality known as the river of life the group murders innocents to prove a counterintuitive point whereby it instills the fear that no one is safe while also bolstering the importance of kohans workenough for him to take the company private as a means of advancing their mission increasing profits unlike past attacks however theyve finally caught their mistake rather than let their work be erased they now only pull the trigger after their victims copy expires a web of intrigue stemming from rohans chief scientist david kurlstat matěj hádek and his wife being the latest martyrs ensues as em once again hopes to use the hunt for a killer to singlehandedly stop river of life completely its precisely this drive to shirk the rules for a personal agenda that endears her to untrustworthy figures and not those protected by said rules enter an illegal copy of kurlstat missing the six months of memories leading to his death a suspected terrorist milan ondríks viktor and a cavalier europol agent václav neužils mansfield each leading to more and more secrets that blur the line between good and evil where it comes to wealth and godcomplexes theres ample lore to work through as far as understanding the overall world onscreen but its so close to our own capitalist wasteland that catching the drift shouldnt be difficult the dynamic built between this technology and how it fits into a social hierarchy fueled by profit is similarly easy to comprehend that means we can devote our energy to getting to the bottom of the more specific mystery who benefits most from a group like river of life why is viktor willing to turn himself in as long as hes guaranteed a fair trial the answers to these questions are hardly unique but the journey towards proving them never ceases to entertain a lot of that has do to with a solid lead turn from mohylováever cautious and skeptical enough to tread lightly with the oftenoverwrought characters surrounding her but theres also the fantastic production design that truly excels beyond obvious budgetary limitations as ingenious art direction expertly turns contemporary items futuristic in lieu of fabricating everything fresh this is apparently czechias first

Aug 9 2023,positive,oppenheimer is christopher nolans magnum opus an engrossing epic that brings you inside the tortured mind of a man driven to change the world cillian murphy is quietly stunning as the consumed oppenheimer and rdj delivers an oscar worthy performance
Aug 9 2023,positive,this is very clear effective disciplined prestige filmmaking enough to make this one of the toniest pieces of oscarbait that i expect to see this year  but it is oscarbait
Aug 9 2023,positive, i dont consider myself a christopher nolan acolyte even though i count two of his films among my favorites more often than not i feel that his overreliance on exposition undermines his ambition i did not feel that way watching his latest epic oppenheimer a riveting cinematic experience that explores the life of j robert oppenheimer the father of the atomic bomb because of oppenheimers biopic nature nolan turns his expository tendencies into an attribute as he meticulously expounds on a man who built his life around a branch of physics few of us understand quantum mechanics nolan approaches oppenheimer from two completely different perspectives the first unsurprisingly is from the point of view of the titular character played by cillian murphy it begins just before oppenheimers 1926 departure from cambridge to study theoretical physics in germany and ends in 1963 when he was presented with a presidential award after efficiently establishing the key figures in oppenheimers life not to mention his intimidating intellect he taught himself dutch in just six week so he could use it to deliver an entire lecture on quantum theory two distinct chapters of his life become the dominant focus engineering the development of the first atomic bomb and the subsequent undoing of his reputation and political influence by postwar mccarthyism the second perspective comes from someone who doesnt exactly leap off of the pages of history but whos extremely important nonetheless his name was lewis strauss the chairperson of the atomic energy commission for which he tried to recruit oppenheimer after the war had ended strauss played in old age makeup and gray hair by robert downey jr recalls his uneasy relationship with oppenheimer to an aide while attending a senate confirmation hearing in just one of his many stylistic touches nolan contrasts the differing perspectives of oppenheimer and strauss by using color film for oppenheimers pov and black  white for strausss which not only helps in keeping track of whose head were in but also beautifully symbolizes how differently they each think oppenheimers dialogdriven historical drama is atypical for christopher nolan but his fondness for juggling multiple timelines hasnt waned nor has his kinetic filmmaking style of rapidly cutting between disparate scenes accompanied by an aggressively persistent background score designed to create a sense of urgency with abrupt silence rather than musical crescendos punctuating the dramatic moments i usually find nolans hyperbolic manipulation of sound and image exhausting here though it works helping oppenheimers threehour runtime feel much shorter several actors manage to distinguish themselves from the massive cast of topnotch talent including matt damon as the lieutenant general in charge of the manhattan project benny safdie as oppenheimers thorny colleague and intellectual foil emily blunt as his fiery alcoholic wife and gary oldman as a selfsatisfied harry truman but no character in this or any of nolans previous work is as complexly drawn as cillian murphys oppenheimer whos presented as intelligent yet naïve scientific yet philosophical honest yet secretive prone to getting lost in thought contemplating whirling electrons and nuclear fusion and in the end a tortured soul nolan refrains from passing judgment on oppenheimer  leaving that to us if we so choose  suggesting instead that its within our inherently contradictory human nature to create as well as destroy considering how now more than at any other time since the cuban missile crisis were all living under the shadow of oppenheimers creation oppenheimer is the movie of our time ever since he was a teen paul has been involved in some form of film criticism exhibition or production for the better part of two decades he moderated the film discussion group lets talk about the movies which used to meet weekly inside the mezzanine of the historic del mar theater in downtown santa cruz in 2023 pauls insightful ksqd movie reviews earned him tomatometerapproved critic status on rotten tomatoes 
Aug 8 2023,positive, christopher nolan delivers what is certain to be a serious awards contender with this stunning biopic of j robert oppenheimer the father of the atomic bomb beautifully shot brilliantly acted and impressively written its one of the best films of the year the film unfolds in two parallel timelines with nolan crosscutting between them the first entitled fission is shot in colour and begins with oppenheimer cillian murphy as a student taking him through his stewardship of the manhattan project the creation of the atom bomb and its eventual deployment by the us government in 1945 the second fusion is shot in black and white and details both a security clearance hearing that is essentially a kangaroo court aimed at discrediting oppenheimer and a separate hearing involving atomic energy commission chairman louis strauss robert downey jr and his potential appointment to the senate the significance of which becomes clear as the film unfolds throughout the film important figures in oppenheimers life emerge including his wife kitty emily blunt his communist mistress jean tatlock florence pugh lt gen leslie groves matt damon who appoints oppenheimer as the leader of the manhattan project best friend isidor rabi david krumholz fellow scientist ernest lawrence josh hartnett albert einstein tom conti and dogwithabone prosecuting attorney roger robb jason clarke who dominates the security clearance hearing murphy whos been a reliable supporting presence in previous nolan movies is simply terrific in the lead simultaneously portraying oppenheimer as arrogant vulnerable naïve and visionary to that end his ice blue eyes are put to extraordinary use a faraway gaze that takes in both the future and the past as well as a universe composed of atoms and electron waves murphy essentially makes you feel oppenheimers every thought and its intoxicating the supporting cast are equally astonishing particularly downey jr who is on career best form as strauss  his best supporting actor nomination is surely already in the bag its a truly magnificent turn initially starstruck and then increasingly full of resentment and bitterness as he finds himself opposed to oppenheimer at various turns damon runs him a close second with a delightful turn as the bullish groves and there are memorable turns from a multitude of great character actors as the other scientists at los alamos the script skilfully adapted from kai bird and martin j shermans biography american prometheus the triumph and tragedy of j robert oppenheimer explores a number of compelling themes from the central prometheus parallel giving mankind the seed of its own fiery destruction to ideas of guilt and redemption as well as complex political machination theres also the subtle intriguing suggestion that nolan sees oppenheimer as an incendiary twentieth century artist akin to the likes of ts elliot or picasso both of whom receive prominent namedrops visually the film is simply stunning especially if youre lucky enough to see it in imax on 70mm the way the director intended  the giant shots of murphys face are worth the price of admission alone the level of technical achievement throughout is astonishing from jennifer lames pacey editing to hoyt van hoytemas striking cinematography to ludwig göranssons powerful score similarly the sound design is extraordinary particularly in the aftermath of hiroshima when oppenheimer is forced to confront the magnitude of what he has done in the face of a seemingly rapturous audience one of the films standout scenes the central setpiece is of course the trinity explosion complete with an extremely tense buildup and a note of blackerthanblack comedy as all the scientists agree that there is a near zero chance that they wont ignite the atmosphere and destroy the world in the process but none of them can really say for certain the actual detonation is another example of the films impressive sound design work but to say any more would be to dilute the impact perhaps nolans most impressive achievement is the fact that he manages to make the hourlong third act of the film the two hearings just as compelling as all the bombrelated stuff that precedes it effectively its prestige courtroom drama complete with the genres requisite shock twists and turns in short this is a stunning piece of work on every level a compelling beautifully constructed biopic that leaves you with plenty to think about its also one of the best films of the year dont miss it
Aug 7 2023,positive, christopher nolans oppenheimer demands that we consider the father of the atomic bombs life in context the which he does with stunning clarity considering the paradoxes the film considers like the quantum world revealed by the new physics that oppenheimer cillian murphy brought to the united states between the world wars things can work even if the underpinnings of why defy rational explanation that can mean a relationship between adults or the construction of a bomb that will change the world even if the math behind it doesnt work searching for the reality behind it is as opined by a character fruitless even if it is a fascinating intellectual exercise and that is what nolan has constructed here a peerless intellectual thriller told with urgency and embracing the paradox until it resolves into a bittersweet poetic sort of justice proving einsteins here an an avuncular tom conti conjecture that god does not play dice told in flashbacks and flashforwards the narrative structure mimics the fluidity of time in that cimentioned quantum world the facts of oppenheimers life are stripped down to details that move the story along without weighing it down key moments and elegantly simple montages telescope time and speak to the revolution in physics as well as the culture that enthralled oppenheimer including the leftleaning politics that would come to haunt him they also highlight the contradictions of a troubled young man who once tried to poison a tutor that he particularly liked these resolve themselves into a man who is both a genius and an innocent who understands that theory will only get you so far as he puts it but who is continually baffled by the shifting realpolitik of life where everything is relative again thank you albert shifting between color and black  white between oppenheimers security clearance hearing before the gray board in 1954 and the senate hearing of lewis strauss robert downey jr in 1959 a proceeding that comes to hinge on the former oppenheimers life from troubled postgrad with no talent for experimental physics to the most influential scientist of his day is recounted not chronologically but in a series of juxtapositions that compare and contrast testimony while also creating an atmosphere of intrigue and danger that ranks with the very best suspense films underpinning that is nolans dialogue of rigorous precision that ahem paradoxically exposes the vagaries of language be it a mathematical formula or a crossexamination or a defining the end of the world as we know it it is the mark of a master that he can take an incident in this case the explosion of the first atomic bomb and make it unbearably tense yet nolan does just that with skillful editing a hand josh peck in a pivotal role hovering over a large red button and jittery set of strings building to a musical crescendo that explodes into silence the trinity explosion telegraphs not just the uncertainty of what will happen when the countdown reaches zero but the weight of two hundred years of physics distilled down to a moment that might end life on the planet or prove that that everything they believe is wrong here and throughout nolan gives us the facts and the revelations but also judicious foreshadowing by externalizing oppenheimers inner struggle to navigate the real world with cuts to the quantum world that obsesses him murphy and his incandescent blue eyes capture that peculiar innocence and passionate curiosity that comes of living in a reality that is only tangential to the rest of the worlds stymied by the imprecision of language and adhering to a moral certitude that may be evolved may be misguided might very well be both it results in his crowning achievement and his downfall the innocence has a childlike quality that expects the world to make sense and a delicacy that is continually surprised and wounded when it isnt that world is populated by great love jean tatlock florence pugh whose emotional instability is matched only by her own passion and intelligence and wife kitty emily blunt a whipsmart emphasis on whip biologist at a time when the world had no use for one her own instability so often glibly pigeonholed as difficult is presented with compassion and the relationship she had with oppenheimer is less analyzed than explicated in all its messy complexity as something that worked for them and that without which neither would have been able to thrive leaving us with the pointed question who are we to judge the early days in europe learning the new physics bring us niels bohr kenneth branagh who sees oppenheimers potential being wasted isidor rabi david krumholtz who overlooks oppenheimers innocent theres that word again arrogance to become his biggest supporter in good times and bad as well as the voice of ethics and reason the manhattan project four years and 2 billion brings gen leslie groves matt damon as the ultimate pragmatist tasked with wrangling the best minds at his disposal to do the impossible and build the atom bomb before the nazis do the formidably arrogant edward teller benny safdie playing with paper airplanes to emphasize his contempt for everyone around him and lt col nichols dane dehaan as the ultimate functionary as easily imagined like the head of security col boris pash casey affleck heiling as saluting if an accident of birth had landed them in germany rather than america then there is strauss politically entwined with oppenheimer the embodiment of vain egotism and the ultimate politician untethered to anything but power downys performance is never simple and has the underpinnings of a tragic hero in a mold diametrically different from that of oppenheimer and in its own way replete as it is with a selfawareness that oppenheimer lacked the quintessence of tragedy oppenheimer is a masterpiece of image and word of complex ideas made manifest and all kept at a very human level to maintain that constant immediacy i sincerely hope that there is a longer directors cut if only to extend the pleasure of watching an artist at work and maybe giving richard feynman jack quaid more than a few words and some bongo riffs very impressive probably one of the most thorough and incisive biopic in a long time would be a gross injustice for it not to receive academy award consideration for best pic and murphy for best actor
Aug 6 2023,positive,one of the most stirring things about this excellently dense and jumpy biopic is that nolan never tries to reconcile his subjects contradictions if anything he realises the futility of trying to know the unknowable who was j robert oppenheimer
Aug 5 2023,positive, its often said that the victors write history although the allies won world war ii who won the battle for influence and power within american politics and society in the aftermath of the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki is a more difficult question to untangle oppenheimer doesnt necessarily seek to do so but its shifting chronology charts the personal viewpoints of those involved in these global conflicts chief among those figures is j robert oppenheimer cillian murphy the director of the los alamos laboratory and manhattan project the film jumps across different periods of his life progressing linearly but intercut in a typical piece of nolan time manipulation from his early studies through the development of the atomic bomb and its deployment the decision to strip his security clearance in 1954 at the height of the postwar red scare period to lewis strauss robert downey jnr confirmation hearings for a us cabinet post in 1959 where there was a strand of questioning over his role in the oppenheimer affair the entwined time periods have a slightly disorienting effect as the film establishes itself whirling at breakneck speed from a younglooking cillian murphy through oppenheimers tenure at lewis strausss institute for advanced study at princeton to a somewhat more haggard and aged appearance at the 1954 hearings however without the needlessly complex mechanics of tenet to contend with their first collaboration nolans second film with editor jennifer lame bears more fruit this time the momentum the film generates due to the chronological crosscutting becomes relentless and that runaway feeling is beautifully harmonious with the films broader interest in oppenheimers legacy the momentum the film generates due to the chronological crosscutting becomes relentless and that runaway feeling is beautifully harmonious with the films broader interest in oppenheimers legacy the bombs development and the trinity test are naturally the plots pivot points still the structure of oppenheimer lends that literal explosive force metaphorically to the leadup and aftermath of the detonation conferring the same sense of urgency and impact the film successfully imbues the postwar period with rising panic the films final moments become a horrifying pit of dread and the prebombing buildup with a horrible sense of inevitability the chain reaction is not the literal one of a nuclear fission device but the paranoia fear and response it unleashed a more conventional and linear biopic approach covering the time depicted here would probably be described as a slow burn and perhaps a film that peters out but oppenheimer is neither despite its substantial threehour runtime every scene beats with an urgency no matter the period depicted in particular the decision to also focus segments of the film around lewis strauss 1959 senate confirmation hearings puts american politics and society squarely in the storys blast radius how did americas individualism as a country contribute to how the bombs development and deployment played out how did a failure to reconcile the celebrated individualism of its citizens against mistrust of nonconformism impact the postwar world strauss heralds the institute for advanced study to oppenheimer as a haven for independent minds and oppenheimer is feted with celebrity for his individual rhetorical flair and scientific aptitude yet his nonconformism with previous leftwing attitudes communist associations and penchant for collective action place a cloud over his proclamations for measures to control nuclear proliferation and opposition to the subsequent development of the hydrogen bomb the sense of individual exceptionalism  for both the usa and its great minds  hurtles the world to the atomic age and the cold war the distrust of nonconformist figures and collective action perpetuates that conflict indefinitely an escalating positive feedback cycle that many thought could and maybe still will bring about armageddon american politics and society squarely in the storys blast radius how did americas individualism as a country contribute to how the bombs development and deployment played out how did a failure to reconcile the celebrated individualism of its citizens against mistrust of nonconformism impact the postwar world the spectre of the us government apparatus hangs over the response to the atomic bombs deployment lewis strausss role here comes down to his confirmation hearing in a reasonably minor cabinet role which shows the global ramifications are viewed by many depicted here through a very insular prism in this regard it heightens the impact of this narrow focus that the effect on japan goes unexamined to do so would afford a global perspective many of the figures depicted in the film are simply not concerned about aptly demonstrated by the depiction of us secretary of war henry stimson who spares kyoto on account of having honeymooned there much is also made of how oppenheimers leftwing leanings make him easier to control for general leslie groves matt damon who at one point barks you have the rights i give to you  no more no less the spectre of the us government apparatus hangs over the response to the atomic bombs deployment lewis strausss role here comes down to his confirmation hearing in a reasonably minor cabinet role which shows the global ramifications are viewed by many depicted here through a very insular prism robert downey jnr is the perfect vessel for strauss deploying an affable arrogance weaponised to hide that his frame of mind is almost the inversion of oppenheimers strauss uses conciliatory charm and fig leaves of cooperation to hide a ruthless individualism and sense of entitlement in contrast oppenheimers individual brilliance and personal arrogance undermine a communitarian world outlook and preference for collective action the film is not perfect by any means and bears some of the less effective hallmarks of nolans recent work alden ehrenreichs role degenerates into the most recent example of expository vessels that have recurred in nolans work his advisor firing out leading questions like chatgpt prompts constructing open goals for downey jnr to lay out the plot or character motivations composer ludwig göranssons second collaboration fares better than the migraineinducing tenet score but lacks either the impact of his work elsewhere especially his work on the mandalorian or with ryan coogler on creed or black panther or the emotional clarity of nolans work with hans zimmer however the insistent drive of the film and the terrifically involving performances  no more so than cillian murphys  allow the films shockwave to hit regardless focusing on personal viewpoints for this globally significant development may seem curiously narrow still oppenheimer achieves what the best biopics often do using the personal lens to foreground and examine the wider ramifications of events there are no more significant potential ramifications than the end of the world and that awful looming mushroom cloud haunts every frame of this tense and emotionally violent portrait
Aug 5 2023,neutral, directed by christopher nolan oppenheimer follows cillian murphys j robert oppenheimer as he progresses through his rigorous studies to become the director of world war iis infamous manhattan project filmmaker nolan armed with his own script delivers a technicallyimpressive yet mostly underwhelming drama that admittedly does start with some promise as the movie which runs a punishing 180 minutes boasts a striking opening stretch that contains all of the hallmarks and touchstones associated with nolans work  including eyepopping visuals an intense ceaseless score and several electrifying standalone interludes and sequences the inevitable trinity test interlude is as astonishing and enthralling as one mightve imagined for example theres little doubt then that oppenheimers downfall is due primarily to its exhaustingly dense and egregiously propulsive narrative with the picture progressing into a relentless midsection that contains hardly anything in the way of breathing room  which in turn ensures that the second half increasingly adopts an anticlimactic endless feel ie virtually everything that comes after the trinity setpiece cant help but come off as needless and somewhat interminable the films relative failure is especially disappointing given its proliferation of engrossing attributes including spellbinding performances by murphy and his myriad of costars and a handful of engrossing quieter moments eg james remars secretary of war attempts to decide where in japan the bomb should be dropped and it does seem apparent ultimately that oppenheimer wouldve benefited from a more sedate and traditional approach to its inherently compelling subject matter
Aug 4 2023,positive, this piece was written during the 2023 wga and sagaftra strikes without the labor of the writers and actors currently on strike oppenheimer the movie being covered here wouldnt exist one of the most anticipated movies of the year you would hope that christopher nolans oppenheimer will live up to the hype and boy does it based on the pulitzer prizewinning book american prometheus the triumph and tragedy of j robert oppenheimer by kai bird and martin j sherwin oppenheimer tells the story of the physicist who is responsible for the creation of the atomic bomb  and the moral questions that came along with that work the movie spends much of its first hour on exposition to show what kind of man robert oppenheimer was and to be clear were talking about him as a character from this point forward the audience sees him as a brilliant scientist who doesnt quite fit in hes a man who has a loneliness about him who is often trapped by the inner workings of his mind yet the point isnt to feel sorry for him hes narcissistic and has it in his heart to inject an apple with cyanide to get back at an instructor who shames him in the lab this scene ultimately foreshadows the rest of the film while robert is capable of injecting an apple with poison knowing full well what the purpose of doing so is his conscience catches up to him and he races to stop the man from eating the poisoned apple robert eventually moves to germany to study quantum mechanics being a jewish man there at that time complicates matters something the film could have done well to explore a bit more than it does yes its a threehour movie which is overthetop for any film yet there are plenty of times the film rushes past important moments and glosses over characters that deserve a little more attention theres no question this is an extremely male movie its based in history so its not shocking that the key characters are all white men however roberts relationships with jean florence pugh and kitty emily blunt are so central to the man he is and the man he evolves to be throughout the film both women and those stories arent given enough screen time its a shame to see pugh and blunt underutilized in this way they each give incredible performances no doubt but even fleshing out their stories just a tiny bit more would have made this film more satisfying in particular its disappointing that more attention isnt given to the way robert and kitty struggle with peter as a baby or to jeans eventual suicide the film remains breathtaking and deeply emotional despite those flaws though the way the story unfolds with flashbacks and transitions from color to blackandwhite allows for a more artful narrative as the audience puts the pieces together to understand the mistakes robert made  and what was out of his hands entirely what oppenheimer does is leads the audience to actually root for at least on some level the success of the bomb that oppenheimer has been asked  er told  to work on the justification is that its the only way to end the war altogether but more than that the audience is brought along for the journey of a great science experiment brilliant scientists gather together in a town created for just this purpose they bring their families to los alamos and pour everything they have into making the bomb a reality their hard work and their sacrifices become the key focus roberts included so when the scientists finally test the bomb its the beauty of it that takes center stage the explosion is presented in magnificent gorgeous detail its astounding colorful artistic and silent  until it isnt the sound comes crashing in startling form to signify just how terrifying this weapon could be but the moment that really matters the one that leaves a pit in your stomach is when the scientists learn that the bomb has been dropped over hiroshima again its a scene presented in artistic detail flashing back and forth between cheers and reactions of guilt and sickness and as robert is to speak about its success what he sees instead is the damage thats been done in every horrifying unsettling image cillian murphys portrayal of robert oppenheimer is incredible throughout the film but this may be the standout moment he makes the audience every conflicted feeling he does and its gutwrenching there is more to this story however as robert battles his guilt over what hes helped create and fights fame he hopes to prevent the government from using this as a stepping stone to create something worse and all the while he comes to be accused of leaking information while this part of the film is perhaps the least interesting overall it reveals the motives of the people around him and it serves narratively as a way to explain key parts of his character throughout the film it also reveals his downfall and eventually leads the film to what is perhaps its most poignant message there was always the possibility as the scientists work to create the bomb that it could start a chain reaction that may never end and ultimately it did as emotional beautiful and thoughtprovoking as this film is its that much more powerful because its based on historical events its a film i wont be able to shake for a long time ashley is the editorinchief of eulalie magazine     favorite movies sunset boulevard garden state modern times

Aug 4 2023,positive, oppenheimer the extraordinary film written and directed by the redoubtable christopher nolan tackles not just the history of one man and the seminal event that came to define him but also the complex intersection of science politics and the cult of personality rarely have i left a movie feeling smarter than when i went in but oppenheimer is just such a film and it elevated my thinking especially in regards to the science of politics and the politics of science more amazingly i still dont understand physics beyond newtons third law of motion that every action has an equal and opposite reaction and yet curiously that quote also applies to the emotional reactions of the protagonists in the life of j robert oppenheimer father of the atomic bomb based on what is arguably considered the best biography written about oppenheimer american prometheus the triumph and tragedy of j robert oppenheimer by kai bird and martin j sherwin who spent 25 years researching and writing it nolan took this base material and focused on the successful attempt to dismantle oppenheimers reputation building the background by going backwards and forwards in oppenheimers life much like prometheus the greek god of fire who was punished by zeus for giving fire to humans the post world war ii life of robert oppenheimer doomed him to serve penance for what many saw as conceit compounded by his many human frailtiessexual political and intellectual but this modern day prometheus who unleashed the  power of atomic energy could be more closely associated with icarus the mortal who dared to fly too close to the sun in greek mythology icarus and daedalus his father devised wings made of threads feathers and wax to flee their labyrinthian prison his father warned him to beware of the sins of hubris and complacency advising him not to fly too high lest the sun melt his wings but icarus refused to listen and the sun melted his wings whereupon he fell into the sea and drowned and a labyrinth of storytelling is what this movie is tracking between time frames in his life nolan smoothly transitions from the 195354 atomic energy commission aec kangaroo court instigated by aec chairman lewis strauss to relieve oppenheimer of his security clearance to oppenheimers early career as he finds his way to theoretical physics in england and germany from his ambivalent dabbling in left wing and communist circles to his leadership in the los alamos branch of the manhattan project the vast decentralized program to harness nuclear fusion and create enough energy to power an atomic bomb and the consequences of strausss harassment of an intellectual foe with a still deep base of support from the scientific heavyweights of the time in poker terms this is a study of the consequences of overplaying your hand  it is a complicated story centered on a complex individual who is understood by many and misunderstood by most oppenheimers initial focus was in chemistry his major at harvard but he soon found his way to physics and pursued that course at cambridge it was there that he discovered he loathed lab studies and was unsuited for experimental physics an encounter with max born nobel prize 1959 led him to the university of göttingen in germany where the field of theoretical physics and quantum mechanics were starting to take hold under the tutelage of born oppenheimer received his phd in 1927 it was here that he encountered and befriended future theoretical physics giants such as werner heisenberg and pascual jordan both pioneers in quantum mechanics and future nazis also with him at göttingen were edward teller and future nobelists erwin schrödinger as in the cat paul dirac wolfgang pauli and enrico fermi fermi would later lead the university of chicago section of the manhattan project teller would join oppenheimer in los alamos returning to the united states oppenheimer received appointments at both caltech and berkeley his residency at berkeley was significant both for his championing and establishing a group focusing on theoretical physics where none previously existed and his association with experimental physicist ernest o lawrence the pioneer of the cyclotron that would be instrumental in developing the atomic bomb it was also at berkeley a bastion of left wing ideology long before the 1960s that oppenheimer flirted with communism never joining but always cavorting his brother frank urged on by his wife at the time joined and oppenheimers lover the volatile jean tatlock was an active member oppenheimers political leanings were decidedly to the left of center possibly far left but his ambivalence was probably more fueled by his avoidance of being identified as one thing or another thus all sides of the pro and anti equation thought he was something he wasnt  as war started to rear its head in europe and rumors of jewish annihilation in nazi germany began to surface einstein now living in the united states wrote a letter to president roosevelt warning him that germany was researching the use of uranium in bombs and that the us needed to begin such a project immediately thus were born the seeds of the manhattan project a multipronged rather decentralized program to harness the new physics of the atom into practical military usage general or soon to be leslie groves was appointed to head the project and choose the sites for research as well as those individuals to head up each division in typical army thinking groves previous experience was in the construction of the pentagon something that was deemed suitable experience for supervising a high level physics project but his skill area was actually in choosing the right people to head each program and he chose oppenheimer a curiously counterintuitive selection based on his assumed politics and lack of managerial expertise for the los alamos project a site suggested by oppenheimer it is strausss animus that shades so much of the film by the time they first meet it is after the war and strauss offers the now famous and lauded oppenheimer the directorship of the institute for advanced study in princeton long the home of einstein it is here that strausss multipronged hostility takes root when he is convinced that oppenheimer turned einstein against him whether this actually happened or not what is unmentioned is that strauss a trustee of the institute was himself a candidate for the directorship losing it may have been hard he was 5th choice but having to give it to a left winger like oppenheimer was a humiliation but only the first strauss a jew committed to many religious organizations was disdainful of oppenheimers secular attitude a wealthy selfmade man without a college education strauss was both proud and defensive of his origins  strike two came later when oppenheimer as a member of the general advisory committee of the newly formed aec ridiculed strausss position that the humanitarian provision of radio isotopes to our allies was a security risk worse the full aec board of which strauss was a member voted four to one to release the isotopes leaving strauss on the fringes  returning to the los alamos years oppenheimer oppie as he was affectionately called made sure that groves dictum that all research be compartmentalized for security reasons was followed at least in practicality if not in spirit alien to oppenheimers nature he created committees and subgroups across divisions that discussed relevant findings that could dovetail into furthering the work and speeding their results  as chronological as this retelling may be the most important takeaways about oppenheimers personality are his inclusiveness and ability to stay out of the way of the men he hand picked his brilliance as viewed by others was his incisive mind but from my standpoint his brilliance was in recognizing his own intellectual shortcomings and refusing to interfere in arenas where others had skills that surpassed his own of the scientists he chose to join him in los alamos seventeen would go on to win nobel prizes abraham pais a colleague of oppenheimers at the institute for advanced study said of him there was no greater satisfaction for him than to see such efforts bear fruit and then to tell others of the work that someone had done j robert oppenheimer a biographical memoir by ha bethe national academy of sciences oftentimes accused of arrogance i believe it was more a recognition of his own worth that may have grated on those who did not fly in his circle and strauss was one who did not humility is generally not a characteristic associated with genius to quote david lillianthal first chairman of the aec he was the only authentic genius i have ever met but there is no doubt that our modern day icarus flew too close to the sun he was against the creation of the hydrogen bomb and nuclear proliferation both loudly supported by edward teller and lewis strauss never apologizing for the use of the atomic bomb on japan oppenheimer campaigned against its further implementation teller never forgave oppenheimer for not pursuing his model of the hydrogen bomb at los alamos despite the fact that oppenheimer allowed him to continue his research on this infinitely more powerful weapon undisturbed that teller testified against him at strausss 195354 hearing would eventually have negative consequences on tellers acceptance in the academic community  oppenheimers inability to control his libido didnt help him in his personal life choosing his paramours from among the wives of his colleagues his own marriage and its shotgun aspect may have fueled some of his ambivalence to fidelity but his leanings were wellestablished early on  nolan assembled a cast of thousands well at least many and all of them deliver some of the best work in their vast repertoires cillian murphy as oppenheimer is a revelation of depth drama intelligence and complexity he is in almost every frame and holds us in the intensity of his haunting blueeyed gaze like others in this film it is impossible to think of any other actor who could play this role nothing in his previous work with nolan dunkirk inception would lead you to believe that he would be the natural lead for a movie about one of the most important scientists of our time and yet he is robert downey jr as lewis strauss gives the performance of his career one that will allow you to forget that he has spent the last decade playing comic book superheroes his strauss is subtle devious and duplicitous all couched smoothly in the skin of a patriot the very embodiment of a paranoiac downey effectively conveys the feelings of the very smart when they encounter true genius the dismay reveals itself in his body language as strauss is left on the sidelines instead of the center to which he is accustomed the expression revenge is a dish best served cold comes to mind as you witness the machinations played out tiny bit by tiny bit bland almost obsequious in his early dealings with oppenheimer he is the proverbial wolf in sheeps clothing luring his surprisingly naive and blindered prey to cliffs edge where only a tap on the back will yield the precipitous fall he has engineered almost from the start of their relationship an unrecognizable emily blunt plays kitty oppenheimer the long suffering and insufferable wife the anger smoldering just below the surface and her overall dissatisfaction is one that she makes understandable to all who would laud her husband she is an actress of incredible range and nolan successfully makes use of it  there are far too many amazing actors most of whom make a meal of the small roles they play foremost among them is matt damon as general groves one never doubts the seriousness of his task and yet damon is able to leaven many of his moments with a subtle humor that makes you smile his was one of my favorite roles  florence pugh plays jean tatlock as the unhinged and passionate temptation that oppenheimer is never able to resist josh hartnett portrays ernest lawrence as a charmer one who is comfortable in his brilliant skin tom conti has a wonderful cameo as einstein and benny safdie is a very petulant edward teller who can see no other way than his own gustaf skarsgård son of stellan and brother of alexander is a sympathetic hans bethe a friend through thick and thin of oppenheimer but then again oppie probably didnt sleep with his wife kenneth branaugh plays niels bohr interesting side note bohrs son aage neils bohr worked alongside him in los alamos and would also go on to win his own nobel prize making them one of the only fatherson nobelists and in a notable role as roger robb the vengeful strauss loyalist and lead of the secret committee meeting to emasculate openheimer jason clarke gives the kind of chilling performance that makes the hair on your arms stand up but these are only a few of the more recognizable actors among the many many fantastic men and women who play noticeable roles in oppenheimer the score by ludwig göransson pulsates and underpins the action sequences and those of the lushly filmed light explosions the music heightens the urgency attached to the work in los alamos shot gloriously in imax by hoyte van hoytema he has captured lightning in a bottle with his clips of light explosions and chemical reactions that fill the screen he has made the desert almost a moonscape another character in the film see oppenheimer in a theater and on an imax or xd formatted screen if at all possible cinematically emotionally this movie carves out a world that is filled in equal measures with optimism and despair oppenheimer and oppenheimer are more than the sum of their respective parts it is quite frankly the human condition neely swanson spent most of her professional career in the television industry almost all of it working for david e kelley in her last fulltime position

Aug 4 2023,positive, oppenheimer is christopher nolans 12th feature film and perhaps his most ambitious yet thats saying something considering this is the director of challenging epics such as interstellar dunkirk and tenet the latter arguably being one of nolans weakest films  oppenheimer is definitely a step up from tenet a much more relatable and human story and one that bears a huge historical significance nolan attacks j robert oppenheimers story headon attempting to understand a complex man who would go on to be credited as the father of the atomic bomb  here he is presented as a man with a sense of uncompromising vision and purpose but one who would become haunted by the part he played in history  as weve already seen from the impressive trailers oppenheimer unfolds both in colour and blackandwhite sequences nolan has already commented on this choice with colour scenes representing oppenheimers subjective experience the blackandwhite unfold from the perspective of robert downey jrs lewis strauss and are more objective in nature  the style choice proves a tad jarring at first in fact the entire first hour of oppenheimer is rushed and packed to the brim with information which is nearimpossible to absorb nolan throws characters names places and sciencey words at us at a dizzying pace and it becomes exhausting  thankfully after that first hour oppenheimer really finds its groove the dual timeline follows oppenheimer as he attempts to build a bomb to end all wars as well as the fallout from that as he is years later sitting in front of a security council being questioned about his past relationships and intentions  the difference between oppenheimer in 1942 and 1954 is staggering not so much because of any makeup or vfx tricks to age actor cillian murphy but the haunted look on the actors face murphy is simply extraordinary as oppenheimer a man driven by blind ambition and aimless innovation  murphy is supported by the very handsome and talented cast around him out of the large  too large you might say  cast downey jr and emily blunt who plays oppenheimers wife kitty stand out downey jr is remarkable in a tricky role thats farremoved from his witty public persona and his role as tony stark in the mcu  but oppenheimer is definitely a bit of a sausage fest while blunt is sharp as kitty nolans writing is flawed when it comes to his female characters oppenheimer includes nolans first sex scene and its exactly as youd imagine it unfussy straight to the point and a little awkward  florence pugh plays oppenheimers early girlfriend jean tatlock she only has roughly 15 minutes of screentime but pugh makes the most of it even though a large portion of the role requires being naked without spoiling too much kitty and jeans characterisations feel a little oldfashioned and troubling there simply doesnt seem to be time or any real effort to build or develop the women in oppenheimers life  ludwig göranssons score as expected is magnificent but heavily planted in some scenes which marginally eats away some of the films magic hoyte van hoytemas cinematography is aweinspiring and nolan a pragmatic economic director certainly knows how to frame a shot and find the essence of every scene  the tight closeups on oppenheimer tell us more about him than any line of dialogue ever could and a sequence where the crew tests the bomb might be the finest scene well see on the big screen this year nolan has previously stated that the film is a little bit of a horror film and that statement feels correct there is something utterly horrifying about oppenheimers story but crucially nolan never defends or judges him  nolan also never shows us any of the destruction that oppenheimers creation leaves behind oppenheimer casually mentions the land they have built the testing site and an entire town should be given back to the indians but for the most part oppenheimer is another story about a white mans guilt without any input from the communities that were affected by his actions  oppenheimer much like its titular character slightly falls victim to its own endless ambition the films sheer density and a revolving door of characters make it heavy but more often than not nolans filmmaking soars nolan who has always been accused of being unemotional and cold as a storyteller has crafted his most humane film yet   theres something cleansing about witnessing yusufcat stevens wander onto the stage in his 75th year and strum through his soulful repertoire its an experience that triggers an emotional response  theres something cleansing about witnessing yusufcat stevens wander onto the stage in his 75th year and strum through his soulful repertoire its an experience that triggers an

Aug 3 2023,positive, texas usa  its telling that christopher nolans oppenheimer  a mammoth drama that zips through montages of men talking in congressional chambers scientific labs and new mexico deserts where history will eventually come alive with blinding light and a gutlevel reaction like few directors can achieve on this scale  ends suddenly what were left with is a note of mystery over whether weve really seen it all  it could be because the political power games that stuffed and sometimes stifled the events of the previous three hours are finally revealed as what they were petty washington squabbling failing to take full stock of the godly power thats been delivered by the movies eponymous physicist until doom dawns behind the globesized eyes of the actor playing him for as much as nolans epics traffic in mindmelting rules at least until shattering them with an imaxscreensized mallet the british filmmaker also loves leaving us with a tinge of cosmic ambiguity and cillian murphy  playing j robert oppenheimer the father of the atomic bomb in a rare and welcome leading part  comes equipped with a gaze able to channel that ambiguity with startling clarity  it could also be that oppenheimer simply hasnt earned the moment ever since inception every new nolan film has felt like a summation of what hes been building up to his movies may be cold but coldness is the natural destination for his characters once theyve been humbled by their own sheer brilliance bruce wayne and alfred borden and dom cobb eventually come face to face with the worlds of their own makingas does j robert oppenheimer among the most brilliant of nolan protagonists if the slowonset psychological devastation we come to witness is any indication yet at times in this 180minute saga it can seem like nolan  working from kai bird and martin sherwins pulitzerwinning biography american prometheus  obfuscates the full depths of his subjects burden undercutting the very subjectivity that sets the movies best sequences ablaze with the consequences of ostensibly heroic actions theory can only take you so far oppenheimer says at one point indeed  oppenheimer was a physicist but oppenheimer is as sturdy a feat of cinematic engineering as any of nolans prior efforts nolan approaches his stories like rubiks cubes which here means were kept on our toes so as not to stumble under the constantly shifting tectonic plates of his script the movie opens several years after the bomb has been dropped in 1945 foregrounding the political rivalry that blossomed between former associates oppenheimer and lewis strauss robert downey jr in the 50s mired in separate uphill battles whose atoms nonetheless jump to each others orbits  the scientist trying to retain national security clearance amid accusations of onceuponatime communist activity the politician trying to be confirmed for a cabinet position  this latter timeline serves as the arena in which j robert oppenheimers experiences will be recalled and recounted and in exacting sometimes challenging detail you can understand why the mccarthyism of the 1950s made no concessions for the privacy of its targets  the shifting proximities of timelines and motivations in oppenheimer  most of it presented in color some of the latterchronology scenes in blackandwhite  unfold with thrilling rhythm tightly weaving the dense tapestry of people and places key to oppenheimers burgeoning role in the war and world to come these include his time learning in europe as a promising young talent an eventual arrival in berkeley and his interests in radical methods to solve the worlds issues much to the chagrin of school administration eventually hes recruited  into a secret military project whose objective oppenheimer is smart enough to infer simply by paying attention the germans are turning to science to build a massive new weapon and the americans surely are off to their own pursuit  the directive set forth in nolans last film tenet was that its confusing backwardsisforwardsisbackwards chalkboard logic didnt matter so long as you surrender to the sensory thrills of watching it in practice oppenheimer is a much better film than that one but were expected to play by different rules that is youd better pay attention for as much as oppenheimer showcases the directors knack for harmonizing music image and sound into engrossing cinema the movies momentum has a way of cobbling storytelling intentions back together just as theyre on the verge of crumbling a moment arrives when before heading to los alamos to direct the manhattan project oppenheimers wife kitty emily blunt declares everythings changing we know what she means in practical terms but at certain junctures in the story we can hardly appreciate whats to come when the sights of where we just were were fleeting  this kind of narrative propulsion isnt new for nolan who over the years has made a convincing thematic case out of the disorientation his movies sometimes afflict us with and yet the films speed  necessary to crunch decades of history into a condensed character study  is a bit like a trick in itself both neglecting to let us dwell in a moment while emphasizing that oppenheimer himself rarely did he was a careful and calculating scientist in the eyes of his colleagues while at home he cheated on kitty and struggled with mental torment as a young man he was attracted to a challenge but we come to wonder if this wasnt out of selfpreservation he understood the importance of strategy but he was also impulsive  the showcasing of these contradictions play out in the movies first hour like necessary legwork the elements and components of an equation being carefully applied before a result to be divulged much later in the film reveals the truth behind what oppenheimer is remembering and also how this is all being remembered occasionally oppenheimer will sprinkle in an astounding few frames of atoms suspended in space of fleeting apocalyptic imagery of particles spinning so fast they resemble a film reel its apparent this is more than just a way to get us cinematically invested in the science beyond terminology the average moviegoer wont understandit could very well be that in nolans estimation robert clung to the inexplicable in order to make sense of what was in front of him on newspapers and the tired faces of lovers who continue to haunt him whats clear is that oppenheimer acknowledges a moral complexity that its subject willfully desperately blinded himself to  nowhere is this more apparent than the movies faces and youll recognize a great many in the sprawling cast of oppenheimer the filmmaker has on occasion created moviegoing experiences worthy of the term magical yet its hard to think of a bigger trick hell pulled off than revealing that the most consistently deployed spectacle of oppenheimer one of the biggest postcovid movie events lies in the crevices and frowns and reactions of his performers among the carousel are oscar winners with just a handful of lines rami malek gary oldman casey affleck and actors we havent seen enlisted for such gravely material in some time josh hartnett downey jr kenneth branagh there is the dadcore energy of matt damon playing los alamos military leader opposite murphys scientific one and the intensity of blunt who is able to spin her characters onedimensionality into a wrenching initial sign that oppenheimer must and will confront himself  and theres murphy himself whose few opportunities in major leading roles over the years feels like the result of hollywood not quite knowing how to approach the mysterious energy emanating from the canyons of his jawline the alluring blue of his eyes that can turn from villainous to boyish to supremely melancholic in an instant he is a magnetic central force as j robert oppenheimer his internal tugofwar between fighting for the present and despairing for the future asserting itself even in moments that feel most like straightforward presentation of history that he remains the anchor amid a cast as wide as one of the films vistas as captured by cinematographer hoyte van hoytema speaks to nolans own triumph as well as to the frustrations that can spring when dialogue is delivered in such a way that advances story while leaving mood simmering at too low a frequency  its telling that nolan pumps the brakes on his timelinericocheting for the showstopper sequence of the manhattans projects explosive exam in new mexico ludwig göranssons mighty score lends us a hand throughout the film by establishing the tone and tenor but there isnt a stronger auditory cue than the sound of a crackling geiger counter accompanying our first glimpse at the construction of oppies gadget a gripping buildup where talk of science and potential treason gives way to prolonged anticipation and eventually one of the most spectacularly horrifying  or is that horrifyingly spectacular  images in recent american cinema once the various players on screen start scrambling and the intimidating image of an isolated derrick in the desert asserts itself you begin to sit a little straighter this is all to say you may occasionally forget the events of oppenheimer revolve around security clearances and bombs an impressive recalculation that underscores the complicated endeavor nolan has set forth for himself how does one recount an incredible historical event whose implications could only truly be appreciated in hindsight once the flash of scientific triumph gave way to the aftermath of destructive power nolan for his part is as forthright on the matter as his subject is devastated by it i would advise you dear reader to pay close attention to a moment of selfconfrontation that will test movie theaters sound systems to an even more deafening degree than the bomb itself only i dont have to because theres no missing it and not in the least because the scene in question is the closest nolan has ever come to outright horror while also accentuating the identity crisis faced by oppenheimer and oppenheimer on the one hand the sequence in question shows nolan reaching for the dizzying peak of his powers the same mountaintop occupied by dreamscapes collapsing in on themselves and a prince of crime wreaking havoc on the other it puts into stark relief the comparative cruisecontrol of the movies looming final third when nolan struggles to keep the sting of moral bankruptcy alive amid streams of crosscutting conversation threatening to submerge feelings of dread or poignancy entirely  perhaps this is how the movie was always going to feel and should feel as a way of replicating the collision between brilliance and selfconfrontation that few figures in history navigated on so stunning a scale as j robert oppenhimer as with most nolan films his latest will benefit from multiple viewings where timelines and ideas will surely click more tightly into place but i also think hes aiming for audiences to pick their own way through the disorientation theyre likely to feel after their first screening the swirling sense of confusion and anxiety you can make out through the toll of history but cant quite shake off perhaps the reason we feel we havent quite seen all we should by the end of oppenheimer is because were living it to this day
Aug 3 2023,positive, the conversation about who and what attracts moviegoers to theaters is usually centered on movie stars its very rarely focused on directors quentin tarantino can still get people out to his movies in droves and so can christopher nolan who will see great success with the opening of  oppenheimer its a testament to his stature as a filmmaker that theaters are selling out for a dense threehour movie about the making of the atomic bomb nolan came from humble filmmaking roots with following memento and the highly underrated police procedural insomnia in 2005 he began his batman trilogy and ever since then has been associated with bombastic movies oppenheimer is no different but here nolan fuses his big filmmaking techniques to tell a human story about process and invention guilt and personal responsibility after his last movie 2020s obnoxious puzzle box tenet its great to see nolan return to working in this mode cillian murphy stars as j robert oppenheimer the scientist credited with the creation of the atomic bomb used during world war ii murphy has been in several of nolans films but has never been the lead  here he proves to be controlled and effective in guiding the entire movie as a performer murphy has been typecast in villainous roles with his bigeyed stare but there is so much acting going on with his eyes a seemingly expressive look tells us so much about oppenheimers thoughts throughout the movie like most of nolans movies he plays with the timeline and cuts backandforth because he wouldnt dare make a linear film at this point oppenheimer moves rather seamlessly between depositions congressional hearings with eventual adversary lewis strauss a terrific robert downey jr and meetings with leslie groves matt damon occasionally playing it a bit too big who oversaw the manhattan project mixed in is a glimpse of oppenheimers personal life including his relationship with jean tatlock florence pugh and his marriage to kitty emily blunt and how they occasionally overlapped pugh is amassing a diverse filmography but it appears she jumped at the chance to work with nolan because her character feels like a plot device rather than a fully developed character blunts character for the majority of the movie walks inandout of rooms guzzling booze but blunt gets a chance to shine in the last act nobody gives an icy stare like blunt and she makes an impact in subtle and unexpected ways near the end oppenheimer is a big movie about men in suits talking but watching the process pays off with the inevitable test sequence of the bomb which is a moment that ranks among the best of nolans career the sound design hoyte van hoytemas cinematography ludwig goranssons score which is arguably the star of the show at times and the ensemble cast all converge in this moment and work in tandem to create a sequence that will make you hold your breath some air is let out of the movie in the final act because it becomes more focused on the deposition that is seen throughout along with the congressional hearing its not as suspenseful as the crafting of the bomb but still a necessary inclusion and helps turn oppenheimer into a morality play nolans movies have suffered from his bloated ambitions in the past but oppenheimer makes great use of its runtime
Aug 3 2023,positive, a majestic mournful entertainment thats as serious as a heart attack oppenheimer is christopher nolans bullseye shot at grand statement cinema thats about nothing less than human annihilation its a meaty message movie brimming with big ideas and weighty themes full of intense debates and furrowedbrow discussions which also still uses its sinewy cinematic form to thrill and awe paced with a crisp gripping efficiency for all of its eyepopping threehour length the filmmakers first biopic focuses its subjective eye on physicist j robert oppenheimer cillian murphy whom the press coronated as the father of the atomic bomb he would be wracked with guilt the rest of his life for the quantum leap he unleashed and then pilloried and slandered for voicing such antinuke agonyfully embodying his nickname as the modern prometheus but buyer beware oppenheimer is not a popcornpicture confection this dense examinationcrossexamination of the man whose impactful deeds inarguably ended world war two and started the cold war is the story of a genius after all told with keen insight and an earnest ability to parcel out an arsenal of facts any movie that namechecks pablo picasso igor stravinsky ts eliot john dunne sigmund freud and karl marx expects a baseline level of cultural engagement from its audience and those paradigmshifting canonical brethren are just the comparatively lowhanging fruit of its liberalarts sophistication come prepared for a heady ride with blinkoryoullmissthem cameos from the superstars of modern physics that few people even know anyway is that foundational danish physicist niels bohr kenneth branagh commanding a nearbeatlemania fervor in the corridors of 1920s european academia whos that walking with einstein in princetons woods with a short single line of dialoguecould it be austrian logician kurt gödel james urbaniak fresh from fleeing the nazis and whats that we see for a hot second behind pioneering nuclear physicist ernest lawrence josh hartnettthe prototype for a particle accelerator recognize them or not these are the people whose passionate work effectively birthed the modern world as we know it nolan uses his impressive stable of hollywood starsand enough recognizable character actorsfor good reason not as stunt casting but as a shorthand for representing so many significant players in americas race to build the worlds first atom bomb when matt damon pops up as nononsense bullshitintolerant brigadier general leslie groves you know hes going to be kind of a big deal what else would you expect for the man who built the pentagon and who the government has now charged with managing a kilotoncapable death machine his most significant act insisting that charismatic academic oppenheimer be scientific director of the manhattan project the us governments shootthemoon nuclear weapons development program germany had split the uranium particle in 1938 and now in 1943 oppenheimer knew timeand the right mix of physicists and engineerswas critically important one measure of cold comfort he believed hitlers own prejudice against quantum mechanics a stillpioneering discipline that he considered jewish science  would hobble him its paradoxical and yet it works oppenheimer enthuses to the first of his growing students at berkeley when he explains the contradictory nuances of the burgeoning discipline in which so much was still unproven my work is soabstract he admits implicitly acknowledging his yearning for a physical manifestation of his ideas all i have is theory no surprise that his intrepid drive as well as his intuitive orchestration of idiosyncratic scientific personalities were the deciding factors in the mercurial brainiacs eventual explosive success whats still astounding is the governments ability to realize his vision oppenheimer knew they needed an isolated facility he recommends his beloved new mexico specifically the barren area known as los alamos he also knew that in order to recruit the best and the brightest he would need to have people bring their wives and children so groves builds him an entire town from scratchhouses churches hospitals telephone poles power lines and all three years 4000 people and 2 billion later oppenheimer groves and his menall of them were men by the way bitterly supported by brilliant resigned women sidelined due simply to their sexare standing in front of a tower with the gadget in a predawn test to change the world the i am become death destroyer of worlds detonation dramatized with the full force of imaxs 70mm image and sound is palpably terrifying one of many choice moments throughout the film when nolan uses his immersive audio design and crystalsharp visualeffects splendor to convey oppenheimers emotional anxiety the real struggle which nolan interlaces with oppenheimers 1920s1940s narrative is the 1959 congressional hearings for admiral lewis strauss robert downey jr a founding commissioner of the us atomic energy commission and a political operative nonpareil who envies admires and resents the heady brilliance of the people with whom he surrounds himself strauss is up for secretary of commerce in eisenhowers cabinet and the hearings hinge on the scientific communitys estimation of his character the conservative and pronukes strauss knows that the liberal peacenikconvert oppenheimer would never support him which is why he masterminded a tribunal to question oppenheimers communist sympathies and loyalty to the united states destroying oppenheimers credibility is the key to strausss political survival nolan toggles between the tense heady days of the manhattan project the 1954 tribunal and the 1959 congressional hearings braiding the three events in ways that illuminate each other as much as they do elevate the anguish that all the characters endure and inflict in equal measure not one of them has impeccable scruples despite their heady acumen they are all very messy very fallible people who fall prey to petty slights haughty snubs unbridled arrogance and wounded pride oppenheimer though hardly a saint is the most sympathetic if only because nolan conveys his tortured world with such clarity what makes nolans film ultimately reverberate so intensely is the notion that such fundamentally emotional people created the worlds deadliest weapons another notion of course they did how human the impulse to both create and destroy were all simple souls i guess oppenheimer murmurs at one point more prescient was his famous remark before they pushed that big red button lord these affairs are hard on the heart stephen garrett is the former film editor of time out new york and has written about the movie industry for more than 20 years a rotten tomatoes certified reviewer garrett is also the founder of jump cut a marketing company that creates trailers and posters for independent foreignlanguage and documentary films great review and great film more needs to be written about how discussion of nolans magnificent effort has been almost yolked in the middle brow msm to the relatively trite  in an existential sense  film barbie i would love to hear what nolan really thinks of this barbenheimmer is indeed a thing and it deliberately lessens the important impact oppenheimer could have no need to spook the horses during our last cold war in the 1980s and 1990s there used to be thousands in the streets protesting against the insanity of nuclear proliferation according to the bulletin of atomic scientists these days we are the closest to nuclear war since the inception of their doomsday clock see constant escalation of ukraine war and the continued pushing of the envelope on taiwan its now 90 seconds to midnight  or the end of the earth the closest the doomsday clock has ever been set to armageddon but hey look at this clip of barbies face melting
Aug 3 2023,positive, this piece was written during the 2023 wga and sagaftra strikes without the labor of the writers and actors currently on strike the movie being discussed here wouldnt exist its a paradox but it works this one brief sentence gets at the heart of the new christopher nolan film oppenheimer serving as a potentially accidental kind of mission statement a movie about the life and times of j robert oppenheimer the scientist who led the manhattan project during the latter years of world war ii and who essentially invented a new form of warfare via the atomic bomb is not impossible but presents a series of challenges to any filmmaker here is a man whose intellect was unparalleled who rubbed shoulders with many of the most remarkable scientists to ever live and whose importance to both american and world history is unquestioned but here is a man whose intellect led to the death of countless thousands of innocent people in service of concluding a world war and whose intellect then inspired other people across the world to pursue more violent means of warfare  the paradox of oppenheimer is that the man deserves a full accounting but that full accounting does not flatter him or those around him that the threehour epic is populated by what feels like threequarters of hollywood with many actors appearing just for a handful of minutes that in many ways the film is centered around the trinity test in which the atomic bomb was first successfully tested in the deserts of new mexico but is otherwise an intimate story in which different groups of men debate things in different locations all presented in crystalclear imax photography but to quote oppenheimer it works  in spite of the fact that nolan serving also as sole screenwriter working off the pulitzer prizewinning biography american prometheus is dealing with only reallife characters and events for the first time in his career he still manages to fiddle around with timelines helping ensure that oppenheimer is never less than propulsive intellectual and jittery in its pacing there are two separate title cards for the scientific properties of fission and fusion that appear early in the film meant to delineate one thread in which oppenheimer cillian murphy is brought before a fauxprosecutorial board of men curious to revoke his security clearances in 1954 and another in which politician lewis strauss robert downey jr goes through a contentious cabinet confirmation process in 1959 but theres a third slightly more straightforward thread throughout in which we follow oppenheimer for nearly two decades from his college days at cambridge leading up to the fateful morning in midjuly 1945 when the abomb was tested in the dark of night headline aside its not really a spoiler to talk about american history especially history of such gravity its to christopher nolans credit that hes able to treat a couple of different aspects of the postwwii downfall of j robert oppenheimer as surprises akin to something in a suspense thriller both regarding someone in the shadows coming out to speak against a key figure in a public manner the 1954 hearing against oppenheimer  which resulted in him losing his security clearance and helped contribute to his falling out of the public spotlight after being celebrated across america for years as the father of the atomic bomb  hinges on a letter written to j edgar hoover by william borden david dastmalchian 15 years removed from his feature debut role in the dark knight that calls out oppenheimer for his leftwing political leanings and his connections to more strident communists among the scientific community and in his personal life  for most of the threehour running time its technically an open question for a senate aide alden ehrenreich to wonder who in the atomic energy commission gave borden the classified material to help accuse oppenheimer the eventual revelation that strauss worked with a sour military man dane dehaan to give borden the files feels less surprising than perhaps expected if only because of how effectively downey jr captures in his performance the frustration and moral impotence he feels between himself and oppenheimer a man who he admires but is humiliated by in countless situations the twist that does work more effectively occurs in strauss senate hearing as he attempts to win a place in president eisenhowers cabinet as secretary of commerce much hinges on the testimony of a scientist named david hill who we see only very briefly and silently earlier in the film but since oscar winner rami malek plays hill its no surprise that he has a crucial moment in offering his testimony at the hearing quickly making clear that hes essentially representing any and all scientists horrified by how the american government treated oppenheimer after world war ii and accurately accuses strauss of having spearheaded the attempt to discredit the eponymous scientist  for any criticisms levied against christopher nolan in his career about being too cold or calculated as a filmmaker theres a strong and intense undercurrent of emotion bubbling under the surface throughout every scene the sequences featuring downey jr those filmed from his perspective both during the cabinet hearing and in any flashbacks emanating from his remarks are in blackandwhite a first for imax photography are rife with jealousy as strauss desperately tries to be accepted by a scientific community that instantly understands his mental limitations and treats him as secondrate of the many recurrent images in the film one that stands out and serves as the kicker for the story is that of strauss watching from afar as oppenheimer speaks with the legendary albert einstein tom conti on the princeton campus before strauss tries and fails to make polite conversation with einstein leading the politician to assume the two scientists were speaking derisively about him and oppenheimer himself is both charismatic and tightly wound from the start when we see him as a young man it seems clear that for all his remarkable intelligence this is a man barely holding himself together and frequently coming apart at the seams  when we think of films shot in imax  not just the ones presented on the towering screens  we think of action spectacles such as nolans the dark knight or tom cruise scaling the burj khalifa in mission impossible  ghost protocol but oppenheimer though it does feature some jawdropping imagery meant to depict the visions of quantum mechanics and physics rattling around oppenheimers psyche he dubs it being plagued by visions before leading up to the trinity test is largely focused on the man himself both emotionally and literally nolan and cinematographer hoyte van hoytema shot this in a mix of imax and 65mm film and if you are lucky enough to live near one of the 30plus theaters in the united states presenting the film in imax and 70mm you must run to get tickets if you havent already procured them and so much of whats presented are closeups of actors faces  as much as christopher nolan is known for his ability to conjure up spectacle like one of the magicians from his adaptation of the prestige hes an excellent director of actors and the proof is in the sixstory images littered throughout oppenheimer murphy whose collaborations with nolan extend to batman begins when he played the scarecrow is the obvious standout doing so much with a man who managed to be both charming enough to win over the might of the american military and government as well as scientists across the world while also repressing the very real guilt and trauma he felt at inflicting death and destruction upon society the use of closeups on nolans part and the tautly expressive emotions running rampant on murphys face recall the silentfilm masterpiece the passion of joan of arc in which renee jeanne falconetti delivered a masterful performance for the ages through her pained visage oppenheimer is not a silent film and nolan gives his leading man plenty of dialogue to work through but its in murphys cutting blue eyes and his tightly wound face that so much emotion bleeds through  with a cast also including deep breath emily blunt downey jr matt damon malek matthew modine benny safdie david krumholtz ehrenreich florence pugh josh hartnett kenneth branagh and casey affleck and many many more oppenheimer is as impressively acted beyond the title role with all actors making such powerful impacts that its almost unfortunate how so many of them only make brief appearances but thats the nature of the timejumping globetrotting story  of course the central moment of oppenheimer its true climax is the depiction of the trinity test again since history is history it should not come as a surprise to anyone that the test works because the abomb would quickly be dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki swiftly bringing an end to world war ii in august 1945 much of the hour or so preceding the test has touches and inspirations from paul thomas andersons there will be blood as oppenheimer reembraces his scientist status after briefly donning a military uniform setting up an oldfashioned town in the middle of los alamos new mexico and all in the hopes of effectively creating an atomic bomb that brings together his theories of quantum physics the nighttime sequence building up to the trinity test with oppenheimer nervy and edgy as the rest of the scientists as well as his military keeper damon is remarkably tense in spite of the fact that as noted above the test clearly works perhaps part of the tension derives from the knowledge many viewers have that christopher nolan priding himself on eschewing cgi when possible has stated that his films replication of the trinity explosion was accomplished with practical effects and though oppenheimer is not an action film nolan is one of the finest filmmakers working today who can effectively and clearly create awesome and terrifying actionbased imagery the trinity test is no exception he van hoytema editor jennifer lame and the entire production team have pulled off something here both weirdly beautiful and definitively horrific that the test works is a validation of oppenheimers theories and of his scientists manhours of work over multiple years and multiple billions of dollars but it also represents  as noted to oppenheimer by niels bohr branagh  a new world not just a new weapon oppenheimer as intelligent as he is is also hopelessly idealistic presuming that by using the abomb america would not only show off its power to the world but ensure a longer world peace because of it so when he approaches president harry truman gary oldman to share the concern that he has blood on his hands hes gobsmacked by truman noting harshly but in some way correctly that the japanese care less about the man who made the bomb than the man and thus the country dropping the bomb  the ensuing horror oppenheimer feels along with the twin revelations of how william borden got his hands on classified materials and how lewis strauss will fail to get a cabinet post culminates in the films final scene as nolan hops around in time throughout the swift three hours of oppenheimer he keeps coming back to the image in strauss mind of how einstein seemingly snubbed him after a brief conversation with our title character but as ehrenreichs senate aide notes its always possible that they werent talking about strauss at all but something more important and aside from being a snide dig we learn in the end that the aide is right in the final scene we get the objective truth of what happened in that side discussion as oppenheimer reminisces with einstein about how the latter reviewed the formers calculations of what would lead to the abomb einstein noted in that earlier conversation that oppenheimer could end up destroying the world if he wasnt careful referencing a possibility that a single abomb explosion would lead to a catastrophic chain reaction of neverending detonation and the world going up in smoke in an instant literally that never happened but metaphorically i believe we did oppenheimer intones quietly as devastating as oppenheimer is and as much as the final moments of the film visualize the terror in the mans mind at the notion of having destroyed the world recalling the line from the bhagavad gita i am become death destroyer of worlds that oppenheimer used to refer to himself in real life it avoids being overly didactic or polemical theres little doubt that nolan is not treating this man as a savior  perhaps the most disturbing scene of the film comes after the trinity test as oppenheimer gives a speech meant to rouse a crowd cheering on the end of wwii due to the abomb thus cheering on the death of thousands but envisions the crowd engulfed by the same bomb with charred bodies and flapping skin  but hes treating the man with depth and honesty christopher nolan has made variations on the themes inherent in oppenheimer before from men rent asunder by warring internal motivations to the horrendous and aweinspiring power the human mind can wield but this film feels like an apotheosis for so much of the career leading up to this moment as befitting its ideal presentation this is a big mammoth movie boasting a careerbest performance from cillian murphy a whipsmart script and other technical marvels jennifer lames editing is particularly remarkable ensuring smooth transitions from timeline to timeline and sometimes from aspect ratio to aspect ratio oppenheimer arrived with huge expectations and has turned out to be a glimpse into american history that speaks with gravity and weight this is one of the best films of the year
Aug 3 2023,positive, director christopher nolans biopic on robert j oppenheimer credited as the father of the atom bomb is an explosive look into the troubled genius mind its a cinematic incendiary of our times powered by some brilliant acting and a compelling storyline the movie spearheaded by an onpoint cillian murphy in the titular role hits you like a sledgehammer as it raises questions on the moralethical dilemma faced by the remarkable theoretical physicist after he was tasked with developing nuclear weapons to alter the course of world war ii robert j oppenheimer a bundle of complex contradictions altered the geopolitical landscape and changed the course of world war ii after he built nuclear weapons at americans disposal and nolan delves deep into his sharpyetmuddled psyche with the precision of a surgical knife and the film works wonderfully because of the collective acting prowess of the starstudded ensemble whether its robert downey jr playing lewis strauss the former chair of the us atomic energy commission with great impact or emily blunt playing oppenheimers wife dealing with alcoholism and her husbands regular transgressions this film is a masterclass in subtle acting every actor pulls their heft with aplomb the movie which opens with oppenheimers murky college episode at cambridge university in which he almost poisons his professor by injecting potassium cyanide into a green apple and later battling suspicions of being a soviet spy gives us a dense understanding of this brilliantly fractured person and fortunately its not treated like a dense physics course that can be overwhelming and difficult to understand this film is one of nolans best and searingly simpleyetcomplicated works the dichotomy between a scientific genius love for discovery and his fears on how his inventions will be used to destroy innocent lives has been wonderfully illustrated every character in this film isnt painted with broad black and white strokes they revel in the grey murphys conflicts and struggles are languidly brought out in the 180minute epic spectacle the superhero although broken is clearly this actor in this epic spectacle the film oscillates between a riveting crime procedural  where oppenheimer the director of the manhattan project  is witchhunted in the us in the early 1950s and an extraordinary story of the rise and fall of a celebrated scientist while the heavylifting is done by a rich ensemble of male actors heres looking at you robert downey jr matt damon casey affleck and rami malek the women in this biopic are equally potent blunt as murphys wife a highfunctioning alcoholic overwhelmed by her own infant  and florence pugh  who plays oppenheimers volatile girlfriendturnedmistress  make a significant impact watch out for the confrontation scenes between the husband and wife and husband and mistress that are heaving with pathos this wellmade feature doesnt pass judgment on any of its characters and doesnt pass that burden to its viewers either visually the film is arresting and reaches a crescendo when murphy and his team of sharp scientists oversee the detonation of the first atomic bomb in the new mexico desert the momentous and grim event was the perfect buildup and made sure that oppenheimer closed with a bang
Aug 3 2023,positive, history isnt always a subject for big ticket tentpole movies and even when directors more familiar with explosions than textbooks try to engage such subject matter the results can be rather shaky at the same time a writerdirector like christopher nolan can truly make crucial moments in the fabric of our society come to life in such a manner that factual events can become something dazzling and also frightening to behold the man did it before with his work on dunkirk and now with oppenheimer nolan has used the father of the atomic bomb to deliver an epic biopic that masterfully walks the line between entertaining spectacle and chilling historical reverence oppenheimer uses a very similar structure to dunkirk in that it tells a handful of different stories across time one half details the academic and professional life of j robert oppenheimer cillian murphy as he speeds towards the creation of the atomic bomb on the other half of the story is admiral lewis strauss robert downey jr a man whos slogging through a senate confirmation hearing in the aftermath of the manhattan project these stories weave in and out of each others orbit shifting between color and black and white respectively with oppenheimer being the common thread as christopher nolan has proven time and again nonlinear storylines are of more interest to him than a straightforward narrative and once again the usage of such a narrative twist helps bring oppenheimer to life in brilliant detail combining scientific and historical fact with his unique narrative flare nolan takes what could have been a flat by the numbers historical drama and makes it an engaging epic in a summer of blockbusters the tenet director has chosen to drop a metaphorical bomb on the competition through a movie that feels more suited for awards season but thanks to the consistently engrossing way that oppenheimer engages its subject matter the dawn of the atomic age kind of plays like an atypical blockbuster itself theres even a moment where cillian murphys j robert oppenheimer dons his iconic look pipe and all that feels similar to a superhero first gearing up in a film like batman begins that observation isnt meant to color christopher nolans picture as a superficial affair inspired by authors kai bird and martin j sherwins american prometheus the triumph and tragedy of j robert oppenheimer this is very much a firm examination of oppenheimers life and times but instead of just showing cillian murphys journey from start to finish in traditional fashion the dark knight director jumps between the pre and post atomic era time periods showing both halves on a collision course with history infusing those happenings with momentum and style from the start you feel like youre living history rather than just witnessing it  the world knew that oppenheimer was going to be a star studded affair as the cast announced throughout the prerelease promotional blitz became too large to ignore upon actually seeing the movie its even more pleasing to realize that that roster including such heavy hitters as robert downey jr emily blunt and matt damon is even more impressive than youd think all of it is anchored by a tremendous performance by cillian murphy who locks in this formula of amazing talent with such gravitas that it never feels like stunt casting everyone in oppenheimers stacked deck gets their moment so if you see a familiar face with no lines in act i be patient lending to the paranoia that ensues throughout the films story the audience never quite knows what to expect from even the most recognizable performers hidden within but again its murphys j robert oppenheimer that holds court front and center from start to finish while thats a foregone conclusion as he is after all playing the titular historical figure this longtime member of the christopher nolan repertory company doesnt play the part as such cillian murphy sees all the facets of oppenheimer and is allowed to interact with each piece of his complicated protagonist properly  theres a great deal of respect for j robert oppenheimer in this project but oppenheimer never seeks to merely cash in on the troubled genius who saw the future card at times robert is the life of the party and scientific genius of the day and at other moments hes a distant womanizer whose deeply troubled by the path he seems to be taking  further credit should be given to robert downey jr as his portrayal of lewis strauss is just as vital and compelling in the black and white narrative oppenheimer uses as its counterbalance its really hard to resist talking about the insanely phenomenal cast thats been drafted by the nolan machine this time out but if theres anyone else to single out when it comes to carrying the same narrative heft murphy is lifting throughout its downey and his deliciously complex portrayal of a wouldbe politician who has to navigate his own association with robert oppenheimer in a very complex manner  historical and scientific dramas like oppenheimer have built a reputation for being stuffy and flat prone to being produced as awards bait films that get released towards the end of the year for such consideration though christopher nolan has been reported as superstitious about releasing his films in the same july timeframe unleashing this captivating title in the middle of blockbuster season makes a lot of sense  oppenheimer isnt merely trying to depict history it also tries to get the audience to engage in its course following the invention of the atomic age both in practice and in politics nolan and his cast are using existing history as a potent warning not to repeat it with that aim the iconic director joins the ranks of other films like tetris that try to show the world the repercussions of pivot points future generations merely read about in textbooks by treating history with a respectable level of event movie flare the door is open for everyone to walk through and partake in stories that have previously seemed reserved to appeal directly to awards bodies and academics in experiencing oppenheimer the audience is invited to live the horrors of this cultural shift as if they were alive when it first happened that method is not only narratively pleasing but it also can be seen as a call to empathy and attention towards the fears weve seen turned into blockbuster fodder in the decades that followed the destructive power that los alamos project made a reality  a studious examination of history shown via a reverent lens of hollywood spectacle oppenheimer is a chilling biopic that could be christopher nolans best picture yet depicting an event that was both marvelous in potential yet horrific in its execution  it is ambiguous in how it morally examines its characters while also being abundantly clear on how it stands on the matter of nuclear proliferation it is nothing short of an epic cinematic triumph and

Aug 3 2023,positive, as dense as a black hole oppenheimer condenses hundreds of pages from american prometheus into a single film filled with enough recognizable actors to populate a small town even at three hours the drama doesnt waste a moment keeping the audience rapt for its entirety christopher nolans adaptation narrows the scope of the doorstop biography and largely focuses on two periods in the wildly interesting life of j robert oppenheimer known as the father of the atomic bomb yet those two periods are momentous enough to have shaped not only oppenheimer but also the broader world the centerpiece is unsurprisingly the atomic bomb testing by the oppenheimerled manhattan project in 1945 but nolan places equal weight on the 1954 hearing that found the physicists loyalty to the united states in question during the red scare nolan gives both events their due in this film that is both challenging and immensely entertaining that seeming dissonance is one of many in oppenheimer especially as it depicts the man himself played by cillian murphy the key theme echoes quantum superposition the principle that a particle can be in two places at the same time similarly nolans film posits that people can be two opposing things at once robert oppenheimer is a genius who is naive to the workings of the world a theoretical physicist whose signature discovery wreaks a massive physical impact on the world and the creator of the nuclear bomb who only wants peace no one here is purely good or evil and nolans film is neither a hagiography nor a condemnation of this controversial figure oppenheimer is decidedly antiatomic bomb in case you were wondering but its take on its primary subject is more nuanced murphy is surrounded by literally dozens of recognizable actors listing everyone whose face you know would consume my entire word count and confound my editor most significant are emily blunt doing a crisp midatlantic accent as his wife kitty also a study in contradictions robert downey jr as lewis strauss the prickly chairman of the atomic energy commission and matt damon as leslie groves the gruff general presiding over the manhattan project but oppenheimer has a deep bench with special shoutouts deserved by florence pugh in a small role as jean tatlock roberts troubled lover david krumholtz as isidor rabi his friend and fellow scientist and alden ehrenreich as a senate aide most characters get just a line or two and keeping all of them straight is an intellectual feat roughly on level with grasping the basics of quantum physics  in theory oppenheimer is the type of biographical drama that most people would feel fine waiting months to see on their tv at home yet even beyond the wide scope of his characters and story nolan challenges the idea of the traditional biopic making it an immediate mustsee on the big screen the format  particularly in the ideal 70mm imax  showcases the massive scale of the bomb tests and magnifies quantum particles to the size of a tennis court however it also showcases these detailed performances allowing the audience to see actors like murphy practically under a microscope showcasing every pore and even the smallest of facial expressions every scene somehow feels simultaneously epic and intimate at this size whether its a pillar of fire or a conversation held around a conference table  oppenheimer is nolans longest film and in many ways its his most ambitious though more structurally straightforward than tenet it refuses the traditional biopic route of telling roberts story in linear fashion instead though it primarily focuses on his manhattan project years and his later security clearance struggles it also offers glimpses of other key moments in his life as well as the senate confirmation hearing of downeys strauss bouncing between these times with speed and ease nolan shifts between blackandwhite and color cinematography changing film stock and aspect ratios frequently the only constant is that its consistently gorgeous  select moments lack subtlety and some of the metaphors are rendered a little too clearly yet nolan requires so much of the audience with this epic drama that its a forgivable sin to occasionally make things a little easy on them but as much as nolan asks of the viewer he provides equal rewards what may be most remarkable in this film about the making of the atomic bomb is the humor woven throughout as well as the warmth oppenheimer the man may not have always understood the people around him but oppenheimer the movie is full of humanity and real emotion  nolan rarely misses and oppenheimer is the director working at his best in a film with big explosions and even bigger ideas this is a complex look at a complicated man but oppenheimer unequivocally establishes that this is a story worth tellingand that nolan was the perfect filmmaker to do it 
Aug 3 2023,positive, from comic book blockbusters the dark knight to science fiction epics interstellar to mindbending thrillers inception to smallscale noirs memento christopher nolan has repeatedly proven himself adept at making genre films of all shapes and sizes if dunkirk his 2017 film about the historic world war ii battle was his bid to prove that hes a serious filmmaker then oppenheimer proves that he should be considered one of the modern masters of cinema i honestly dont think nolan suffers from an auteur inferiority complex and likely spends no time worrying about what film critics or his fellow filmmakers think about his filmography nolan loves to tell a disjointed streamofconsciousness narrative and oppenheimer is no different the film unfolds on multiple timelines before the bomb after the bomb and during the bureaucratic witch hunt that pursued oppenheimer in the commiehunting paranoia of the 1950s the film is not a birthtodeath biopic its a portrait of a pivotal historical figure who forever changed global politics by inventing the weapon to end all wars the editing effortlessly cuts from past to present to future though it may be uncertain which timeline is truly the present creating a fever dream of a film that roils and explodes like the images we see filling oppenheimers mind the cinematography and production design give each time line its own look so the audience intuitively feels which section of the famed physicists life theyre witnessing simply from the visual characteristics of the footage its a brilliant form of narrative shorthand that prevents the need for title cards with dates locations and the like which are so often employed in historical films it keeps the film from feeling choppy or episodic the performances are uniformly excellent cillian murphy is all inward intensity as the father of the atomic bomb quieter performances dont always register with audiences and critics but murphys work here is stunning robert downey jr reminds us all that hes a great actor whos been away playing a comic book icon for a decade his portrayal of admiral lewis strauss a political mover and shaker who tries to advance his career at every turn seems destined to dominate any best supporting actor race even though saying so in july feels absurd the smaller character contributions from kenneth branagh niels bohr tom conti albert einstein josh hartnett ernest lawrence benny safdie edward teller and dozens of others help create a rich narrative where everyone on screen feels like a living breathing human being and not a device thats somehow needed to move the story forward oddly for a christopher nolan film the female characters are mostly objects of lust for the title character florence pugh is an early lover who is cast aside but never leaves oppenheimers thoughts emily blunt plays his troubled but loyal wife who first comes into his orbit as a mistress the nolan universe is known for being largely sexless and the director makes up for lost time putting oppenheimer firmly in rrated territory the timing of oppenheimer is a bit of a headscratcher summer at the theater usually means superheroes in capes sequels galore and neon pink bubble gum pop films like barbie during this season of mindless entertainment nolan unleashes a threehour dialoguedriven epic about the best scientific minds in the world racing to solve a theoretical physics riddle and stop a war einstein oppenheimer and niels bohr uniting to contemplate the ramifications of a nuclear explosion doesnt exactly scream avengers assemble to the average moviegoer however for those of you out there waiting anxiously for the fall movie season when all of the awards darlings hit theaters oppenheimer will give you a smell of pumpkin spice in july a cool breeze on a steamy summer morning that lets you know fall isnt too far away itll become a very crowded field as films from martin scorsese killers of the flower moon ridley scott napoleon and michael mann ferrari enter the awards fray it feels appropriately meta that the first masterpiece of the fall awards season is about a genius who fired the biggest peremptory shot in the history of the world
Aug 3 2023,positive, in the stunning eighth episode of twin peaks the return the series diverges from its main narrative to offer an extended scene of the first test of the atomic bomb at white plains nm in 1945 what follows is a kind of origin story for the twin peaks cosmos culminating with scenes of demonic figures insinuating themselves into a picturesque desert town 11 years after the blast as with all things twin peaks and lynch in general what it all means is open for discussion but it seems unlikely that tying a depictionn of how evil enters the world to the dawn of the atomic age is mere coincidence born a year after the test lynch was one of the first of a generation that knew no world except one that could end in flames at the push of a button  christopher nolans films have little in common with lynchs work but oppenheimer nolans biopic of father of the atomic bomb j robert oppenheimer is pervaded with a similar sense of irreversibility treating the trinity test as a point of no return an act once committed would forever change the world and possibly set it up for destruction nolans films have long played with time and oppenheimer is no exception but here the flitting through the most eventful years of oppenheimers life all feed into or empty out of that fixed moment when the brilliant minds behind an extraordinary scientific project handed humanity a weapon of unthinkable power then lost control of what happened next the reveal is a readersupported newsletter dedicated to bringing you great essays reviews and conversation about movies while both free and paid subscriptions are available please consider a paid subscription to support our longterm sustainability the film unfolds on two timelines each anchored to a dramatic and fraught hearing in one shot in color and anchored in 1954 oppenheimer cillian murphy sits before a committee that will determine whether hell have to surrender his security clearance due to his previous and already wellknown association with members of the communist party the second shot in blackandwhite is built around the 1958 senate confirmation hearing of lewis strauss robert downey jr the first chairman of the atomic energy commission dwight eisenhowers nominee for commerce secretary and a man with whom oppenheimer had a complex ultimately adversarial relationship oppenheimer moves at a sometimes dizzying pace jumping freely through time as it switches between its two narrative tracks nolan introduces dozens of characters across incidents that at first seem unrelated heres oppenheimer as a frustrated student here he is considering taking a princeton job offered by strauss in the years after world war ii its the sort of film that can only benefit from a second viewing familiarity with nolans primary source kai bird and martin j sherwins 2005 book american prometheus the triumph and tragedy of j robert oppenheimer or ideally both but as with dunkirk its also a film that teaches viewers how to watch it details cohere into patterns dots get connected characters first glimpsed in the background come into focus and always at the center even when hes not on screen is oppenheimer long a nolan favorite murphy gives oppenheimer its center of gravity and its sense of graveness in the films earliest sceneschronologically if not always in placementhe already looks like a man burdened with an incalculable weight as if he already understood that the ideas and formulas swimming in his head would have global consequences alarmingly thin murphy has cited late70s david bowie as a physical model restrained in expression and with a low deliberate manner of speaking thats reminiscent of peter wellers william s burroughs in naked lunch murphys oppenheimer is  an unnerving presence but also a man of undeniable genius driven by a strong sense of what needs to be done at all times that drive extends to his unwillingness to draw a line between his educational life and support for leftist causes that put him shoulder to shoulder with communists which sets the stage for his later troubles the intense focus and murphys exceptional work make oppenheimer work equally well as a study of a remarkably complex character whose greatest accomplishment would become his greatest but hardly only source of torment and as the story of that characters journey through one the most transformative events in human history nolan makes oppenheimer both biography and thriller the nervy filmmaking and ludwig göranssons intense score combine in an atmosphere of unrelenting dread thats perhaps expectedly true in scenes of oppenheimer and an allstar band of midcentury scientific minds played by among many others michael angarano benny safdie josh hartnett jack quaid rami malek and olivia thirlby but its employed just as effectively when the film navigates his sometimesrelationships with the women in his life particularly psychiatrist jean tatlock florence pugh and his wife kitty emily blunt a woman whose supportiveness of her husband could never be mistaken for weakness in part because it seems to be stretched to its limit at every moment the rise of ip as a nearprerequisite for riskaverse studios has put directors of ambition in a compromising position how do you express a personal vision within the constraints of fan and brand expectation thats a particularly vexing proposition for greta gerwigs barbie which has to build a narrative around a doll thats had such a seismic impact on the culture and the way little girls understand womanhood that the obligatory hattips and payoffs are not enough there are landmines to sidestep too can you advance feminism while boosting a toy corporation how much can you question the mythos of a doll thats had a mixed track record at best in reinforcing standards of beauty and achievement and even if you manage to thread this exceedingly thin needle can you still show the audience a good bubbly time at the movies  gerwig endeavors to try with the understanding that perfection is unattainable her barbie cannot be all things to all people and it cannot wriggle away from the contradictions that ensnare it its a heroic effort nonetheless a bright and funny and eversoclosetosubversive bauble thats willing to take chances and assert itself in the largest possible cultural arena and that squares with its idea of womanhood as an impossible undertaking that requires a certain guile to pull off if you want to dictate the terms strong women have been a dull obligatory component of blockbusters for years second only to genderreversal in their lack of imagination gerwig goes for complicated and makes a satisfying mess of things  the opening third is the truman show with double the artifice as a stereotypical barbie margot robbie who exists in a utopian barbieland lives harmoniously in her dream house along with a vast product line of other barbies and kens though one ken played by ryan gosling is particularly attached to her barbies perfect days in this matriarchal societykens role here is simply beachare disrupted first by minor hiccups like flat feet and a cold fake shower but thoughts of death and other melancholy issues throw her into an existential crisis that leads the one misfit in town weird barbie kate mckinnon to suggest barbie visit the real world where she can track down the person whos been playing with her and figure out why shes made her so sad with ken in tow barbie discovers the gulf between barbieland and the real world is larger than she ever imagined while ken thrills to the possibilities of importing the patriarchy meanwhile the allmale executive team at mattel led by will farrell labors to contain the situation  gerwig has conceptualized barbieland as a retinapiercing dayglo paradise where actions are imaginary and routines are paramount with a harmony made possible by perfection the scifi absurdity of these plastic genitalfree dolls toggling through their accessories shifts to fishoutofwater comedy when barbie and ken skate through santa barbara on rollerblades and face a topsyturvy world where barbie doesnt seem to have had much impact at all gerwig and coscreenwriter noah baumbach are a bit saddled by the fact that barbie is reeling with melancholy while ken gets to have all the fun with gosling merrily indulging kens love for a place where his cocksure stupidity and love of horses are richly rewarded i wasnt as enamored of oppenheimer as keith is  and i did see it in 70mm imax which means it was under the best possible circumstances  largely because i felt the strauss confirmation hearing was probably one layer too many  last night i watched roland joffés fat man and little boy to see how it treated the same story as expected its much more linear and even provides the viewer with multiple scenes of oppenheimer being actively involved in the science behind the development of the bomb in nolans film were expected to take it on faith that hes so brilliant because he knows so many other brilliant scientists einstein bohr heisenberg etc and everyone else keeps mentioning how brilliant he is  reading about the fluid timejumping of oppenheimer reminds me of the finest chapter in the watchmen graphic novel the one with dr manhattan on mars  i cant even remember if that chapter is depicted at all in the awful moviesounds like nolan does a better job here thankfully
Aug 3 2023,positive, the word operatic comes to mind when describing christopher nolans maddening flawed sometimesbrilliant oppenheimer its his boldest most dense film and one that might come into clearer focus on subsequent viewings  even at three hours the amount of story that nolan packs into this film feels like its not enough to convey everything that he has to say oppenheimer closely resembles dunkirk in the way it manages to weave countless storyline structures into this magnificent whole  of course telling the story of robert j oppenheimer a man who poured blood sweat and tears into becoming the father of the atomic bomb is a complicated one the film wouldnt have worked as well without the constantly brilliant editing techniques of jennifer lame who absolutely deserves all of the accolades she is likely going to be getting for her work here  formally and conceptually oppenheimer is a staggering achievement as it zeroes on a clandestine weapons lab that was formed in the los alamos desert during the thick of wwii this is nolans most complex work and it has plenty of substance to boot maybe too much robert oppenheimer powerfully played here by cillian murphy was a man tasked by the us government to build the bomb but the nazis had a 12month head start on him it was the beginning of the arms race one that would inevitably continue against russia in trying to beat the nazis oppenheimer chose a crackling team of the worlds best scientists many of them jewish refugees from germany to build a weapon whose ramifications are still being felt to this day it quite literally changed the world order in the film nolan goes back and forth between oppenheimers early beginnings as a theoretic physics student in 1920s germany to his los alamos testing site and inevitably to his shunning as a communist during the rage of the 50s mccarthy witchhunts politician lewis strauss robert downey jr a conniving individual who gladly threw oppenheimer under the bus to further his career sleazily instigated the scientists security clearance hearing in 1954 downey jr looking gaunt and older is given chewy lines of dialogue all shot in black and white sequences and hes impeccably cast as the villain of the piece  theres also oppenheimers affair with an american communist named jean tatlock scene stealing florence pugh  it eventually ends hampered by her unwillingness to commit he later weds alcoholic kitty harrison an underused emily blunt whose role is underwritten pugh nude practically the entire time is a wonderfully haunting presence a fragile figure with a tragic fate  the number of characters in this film are aplenty all played by notably wellknown actors theres physicist niels bohr kenneth branagh matt damon as the general overseeing the los alamos project ernest lawrence josh hartnett a physicist who invented a particle accelerator and gary oldman as president truman benny safdie even shows up as the thicklyaccented edward teller the theoretical physicist known as the father of the hydrogen bomb and recent oscarwinner rami malek underused is basically given just one scene heres the thing about oppenheimer when it works it soars some of the scenes conveyed here by nolan and lame aided by composer ludwig göranssons sizzling score feel transcendent however the point of oppenheimer is for it to have a cumulative and powerful effect on the viewer once the 3hour runtime ends can any other filmmaker in hollywood work on this grand of a scale and get away with it maybe martin scorsese but thats about it it helps that nolan is aided by the talented cinematographer hoyte van hoytema who shot the movie in 65millimeter film sometimes van hoytemas luscious photography overshadows the chaotic storytelling to the point where youre sucked in by the images and lose track of the story the film is filled with an innumerable amount of closeups  in fact most of the story is told via closeups if nolans goal was to set the viewer inside oppenheimers head then mission accomplished you cant escape murphys haunted blue eyes and its a towering performance from the irish actor theres also a substantial number of scenes that feel damnnear visceral consider the one where oppenheimer speaks to a crowd of patriotic americans posthiroshima bombing their applause drowning out into mute panic sneaks into his head the sound design starts roaring trembling sounds the camera shakes oppenheimer continues talking but its all reverberating echo this is where he realizes the magnitude of whats hes done and that he has the blood of innocent japanese citizens in his hands the trinity explosion has been spoken about plenty of times as well nolan didnt use cgi and the feeling youre left with is like being there at the first historic test of the bomb as a literal light show occurs and a feeling of relief and dread seeps into the characters  nolan is absolutely obsessed with the subject at hand maybe a little too obsessed in getting every detail of his story jammed into the film and yet it still feels as though oppenheimer might be missing key moments that should have been added into its epic three hours
Aug 3 2023,positive, oppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between the singularly original writerdirector christopher nolan and the irish actor cillian murphy who given the leading role here works diligently under the guise of the physicist who created the atomic bomb j robert oppenheimer populated with lightningfast dialogues oppressive music and artificial tension the film differs from nolans previous moves as theres no emphasis on action in a way the type of narrative adopted by nolan curbs the inventiveness that made memento inception and dunkirk instant classics as a cerebral biopic it tries to get our attention through scientific fascination political repression international espionage and the moral dilemma faced by the title character who struggles with his own creation a massive weapon that poses an existential threat to the humankind oppenheimers guilt is well expressed as well as the cynicism of some of his associates like dr lewis strauss robert downey jr is excellent and edward teller benny safdie even president truman gary oldman disregarded his torment and did nothing to prevent his political persecution  its an interesting if formal film that manages to captivate intermittently shot statically in blackandwhite and color it follows a transparent narrative strategy being structured as a series of slowmoving scenes that require you to dive into meticulous dialogue with tenacity on one side its an opportunity to get a history lesson on the matter but the film only really shines on a few scattered powerful moments it all came up more informative than fun
Aug 3 2023,positive,in a year that has given us several great films this one shines above the rest and is the strongest contender for the oscar so far in 2023
Aug 3 2023,positive, as a young man with visions of a hidden universe j robert oppenheimer lays in his cambridge university dorm beset by an inability to rest hes instantly portrayed as brilliant yet carries with him a darkness his mind may be unmatched but his humanity screams louder than any theory he could present at times he is cruel other times cold and unfeeling and then overwhelmingly ridden with guilt the most important man who ever lived creating a weapon without an equal  oppenheimer takes such a complicated figure and fastens you in to his unique perspective as you watch the development of the atomic bomb youre infinitely intrigued by its herald cillian murphys performance of the legendary scientist is multifaceted seeming vulnerable and exposed in one frame yet operatic and enigmatic in the next the invention itself has a devastating effect but the films warning goes beyond the terror of dropped of the bomb the sequence in which the bomb is first tested is nothing short of an audiovisual marvel but the true danger of the film lies in the protagonists presence as he corrals the worlds scientists to follow behind him robert oppenheimer is magnetic more akin to a cult leader than a lowly whitecoat his followers express their qualms but with one impassioned speech he rallys the troops towards a terrible victory despite this statement on statesmen oppenheimer is non committal in its portrayal of its subject as much as it delves into the psyche of its titular character it makes very little stride in a definitive conclusion on his character oppenheimer will leave you with more information than you may have had about the father of the atomic bomb but undoubtedly create several questions as well the film leaves you to pass your judgement on the man himself his actions and his feelings towards them when all is said and done  note while i appreciate you reading this review movies are still incredibly subjective if you think you might enjoy yourself i encourage everyone to support the cinema industry as much as they can stay safe and remember lifes too short for bad movies  the sound quality of this film is horrendous the subject is weighty and the film is fairly dramatic too bad it so lacks much context of the mccarthy eras red scare it would have been nice if and people i know had been able to hear all the words rather than 80 of them
Aug 2 2023,negative,  inside the mjr digital theater at partridge creek in suburban detroit last week part of the audience behind me reacted with sudden cackles and extended giggles   i had noticed them entering the afternoon matinee a group of girls ages probably from 8 through 14 many of them dressed at least in part in pink as were some of their chaperones who may have been their mothers their grandmothers or their aunts   perhaps some of the laughing kids werent even aware of all the functions of the genitalia mentioned by barbie played by margo robbie that didnt matter even at the pottyjoke level some humor crosses multiple demographics   because of that viewing of this controversial pg13 film should be limited only to people who are men women boys girls gay straight liberals conservatives white black brown red and yellow and also to those who really like the color pink   along with oppenheimer  an overhyped film that is interesting but not as good  barbie marks the summer of 2023 as a barbenheimer moment coinciding with a confluence of cultural undercurrents   for one thing these two movies arrived during the first summer since 2019 in which it feels reasonably safe from the covid19 pandemic for people of all ages to return to indoor movie theaters among unmasked strangers this helps build buzz   secondly these movies came during a summer of showbusiness labor unrest with two hollywood unions actors and writers striking simultaneously for the first time in 60 years at the london premier of oppenheimer its actors walked out in support of the strikers   third both barbie and oppenheimer challenge their audiences to think seriously and critically about important issues like toxic masculinity and weapons that might destroy life on earth barbie is a serious comedy a satire oppenheimer is just deadly serious   the humor in barbie is wry sly sometimes overthetop genderbending and hitormiss if you dont like one gag stick around another is on the way   bits of barbie are animated like a kids cartoon some scenes suggest the truman show the wizard of oz and peewees playhouse it opens with a parody of 2001 a space odyssey a stanley kubrick film from 1968   some of the injokes doubleentendres and glib references fly by so fast it will take several viewings to comprehend them all that alone could make barbie a cult classic   furthermore rightwing politicians and preachers are condemning barbie for its ironic support of feminism and its lgbtq attitude toward sexual stereotypes in that these folks cant take a joke you know there is something good here   like the united auto workers and other unions the screen actors guild and the writers guild of america hope to catch up to the economic disruptions from the pandemic when people sat at home and paid for streaming entertainment on big clear screens   his oppenheimer is an important historical biography with many memorable moments about j robert oppenheimer a physicist who helped create the atomic bomb in 1945 in world war ii he is portrayed well by cillian murphy   there is a countdown there is a big red button gradually sight and sound gimmicks build the tension and enhance the dramatic impact from the theater chair next to me i heard a woman stifle a sob   but after this climax comes another hour of story about how poorly oppenheimer was treated by politicians not convinced of his loyalty after the pinnacle moment of the big bang its an awfully long epilogue   his demise is presented more effectively in the book american prometheus the triumph and tragedy of j robert oppenheimer by kai bird and martin j sherwin upon which this film is based it fleshes out oppenheimers youth and family background to try to explain his peculiar intelligence   some of oppenheimer is filmed in blackandwhite adding another layer of gray to the pictures mood among a stellar cast matt damon steals a couple scenes as a gruff general ostensibly supervising oppenheimer   the screen frequently shows oppenheimer smoking his lit cigarette burning like a fuse on a bomb  or on his career or perhaps hes just blowing smoke in addition we see a jumbled timeline of flashback sequences that worked much better long ago in citizen kane   there is also an imax version of oppenheimer which might further overdo the already overdone special effects unintentionally funny are three scenes in which the physicist albert einstein suddenly appears as if he is shoeless joe strolling out from the cornfields   as for the senior citizen experience of returning to a crowded movie theater in the barbenheimer summer of 23 i saw both films on weekdays in a building with 14 screens large leather reclining chairs offered lots of legroom   at the theater bar new to me in the early afternoon i could have purchased a long island ice tea premium for 1625 or a bloody mary for only 1225 instead i paid just 625 for a large diet pepsi at the popcorn stand   i put it in the generous cup holder on my comfy chair and elevated the electronic leg rest id used such things before the pandemic but i also accidentally touched the switch that turned on the threelevel seat heater who knew in the middle of summer   it took a minute to turn it off no jokes here please about a critic on the hot seat or any tasteless wisecracks about how one movie is da bomb while the other is a bomb or about how some boomers just dont know which button to push 
Aug 2 2023,neutral,  christopher nolans oppenheimer is a massive pot roast of a movie sliced into edible bits most of it is topshelf craftsmanship except for the backandforth structure certainly a sharper brain than mine could tell you why the film hops timelines or goes from color to black and white when oliver stone did this sort of thing in jfk it was to convey as much information as concisely as possible given the threehour running time there were so many moving parts so many talking heads that stones illustrative almost freeassociative approach felt necessary here there are only talking heads and from what were given here a simple story once there was a very smart man who did a very bad thing and ironically was raked over the coals for stuff he didnt even do meanwhile even more ironically he gets medals and handshakes for the bad thing the end  theres one element worthy of unreserved praise here and thats robert downey jrs welcomehome performance  his comeback if you will from his comeback which kidnapped him into marvel movies for eleven years  as admiral lewis strauss the man who got j robert oppenheimer cillian murphy stripped of his security clearance on the grounds that oppenheimer had communist leanings history views strauss unkindly but downey makes him a smart man with understandable sore spots he imbues strauss with wit but not an ounce of the smug hipness that characterized say tony stark or some of his other roles for me the movie changed from oppenheimer to strauss whenever downey showed up his upper lip drawn down in umbrage downey and nolan must have understood that a cardboard anticommie villain wouldnt do  as for cillian murphy id like to say that he shoulders this whole ungainly thing and holds it all together but aside from an accent that sounds at times eerily like robin williams in serious mode murphys oppenheimer seems purposely blank its nothing that murphy does or doesnt do its that this oppenheimer has been hollowed out we empathize with his wife kitty emily blunt and lover jean florence pugh who are always chastising him for one thing or another oppenheimer is reduced to visual iconography  the straightbrim fedora the dark suits the cigarette or pipe early on we see oppenheimer spike a contemptuous professors apple with cyanide the plot is a failure he mentions it later on but if any linkage is intended to his complicity in developing the ultimate deathdealer its certainly kept quiet murphy recedes into himself enacting the selfabasing emotions of a martyr and the movie slips from his fingers into the robust hands of downey or blunt or pugh or matt damon  anyway oppenheimer delivers the bomb it becomes urgent to get the bomb before the nazis do  an army that carries the bomb before it is invincible as old marcus brody might say does it work is an existential question since one of the possible events if it doesnt work properly is oh nothing bad just the annihilation of the planet but it works and thereafter hiroshima and nagasaki are knocked off the board compartmentalize goes a refrain from damons general groves and oppenheimer has to keep his science and his morals in different boxes as tom lehrer sang of wernher von brauns ethos once the rockets are up who cares where they come down thats not my department that verse speaks more mordantly and god knows more concisely about the paradox of oppenheimer than this whole solidly built but pompously designed edifice does does oppenheimer care where they come down does nolan he says he does but does he really care about anything other than physics his passion for which is also given short shrift given the two icons in this summers barbenheimer event i know which one seems more plastic and less human
Aug 2 2023,positive, so begins oppenheimer the tale of fission and fusion the first sentence of the quotation above which opens the film is the story of oppenheimer and fission the act of dividing or splitting something into two or more parts the second sentence which will be represented by lewis strauss pronounced straws is about the fusion that would torture oppenheimer mostly after the bomb the result of the process of joining two or more things together to form a single entity oppenheimer was a master of compartmentalization splitting his life into many parts and managing to control them all but with his decision to lead los alamos the process he took on required the joining of many things together most particularly science and the government  ive seen the film 5 times now in 4 formats and i still dont feel properly prepared to write about the work as it deserves 10000 words at minimum without the freedom to take deep notes  which i wasnt going to do in full theaters  and really the ability to work through the maze of the film with the ability to stop and process at times its too much  but i will do my best to offer some broad strokes i dont know if this really qualifies as a review so much as a discussion of the work i wouldnt read further without having seen the film  the color vs black  white thing has nothing at all to do with time oppenheimers perspective is in color strauss perspective is in black and white i have confirmed that much in these 5 viewings a few scenes cross over and are repeated from each perspective most notably the scenes with einstein oppenheimer is not in every color scene but at least his imagination is the driving perspective in every one strauss was never in the various schools or los alamos so there is no black  white in any of those segments for instance  oppenheimer is prometheus and strauss is there to try to tie him to the rock for his perceived arrogance but really it is oppenheimers own fears of what he has empowered that tortures him for the rest of his life  it has struck me more and more with each screening how this films science vs government arguments are very reflective of what i would assume to be nolans feelings about being a filmmaker and then having to hand his work to distributors to release it into the world as they see fit more than he sees fit obviously he has asserted all the power he has to control his films demanding a long theatrical window for instance and to support the control that other filmmakers have of their films  the camaraderie with which oppenheimer and the other scientists work towards the bomb even with all kinds of inhouse conflict is i imagine how nolan sees his work as an artist in the process of filmmaking which can be dominated by one person especially a writerdirectorproducer but cannot be achieved by one person at anything like this kind of scale you can lead but you need a big village to follow and at its best add to your visions  obviously a movie bomb doesnt kill people like an atom bomb but again i would suggest that any artist especially those who do have a large mainstream reach considers the influence of their work on the world of filmic art and sometimes the world in whole  but getting any movie made much less a movie of massive scale skill and grace requires some degree of myopia any multifaceted discussion of leni riefenstahl may inspire fist fights but it is unlikely that while making her films she was thinking about how she was supporting the annihilation of millions of people i am not saying that is a good excuse but perspective matters in oppenheimer one of the most controversial moments even for people who like the film a lot is a bit of purely symbolic nudity and sex between oppenheimer and florence pughs jean tatlock in the midst of the private hearingprosecution over his security clearance some see it as random and unneeded but it shows us how vulnerable he feels when he is forced to discuss his sex life initially just stripped himself and then in the imagined sex act with the dead women with whom he had one of the few relationships that seems to have really mattered to him its also a critical moment in defining his relationship with his wife kitty as he is aware that tatlock haunts her too as much as she has tried to stiffupperlip it  some ask why jean tatlock is showing more skin than oppenheimer in the interrogation scene i dont think that nolan or anyone else was really measuring for effect for me it is one of the most beautiful images ive ever seen on loss and regret and knowing how someone you love is being hurt by your actions while you have no power to escape the moment tatlocks sex is very purposeful in all 3 of their sex scenes she seems to be getting something kitty doesnt get and likely doesnt want and jean has no interest in the surface things that are part of what drives kitty the two women confronting each other in words and imagination are oppenheimers ying and yang as long i am digressing to discussing the great moments of the film another segment on oppenheimers fear and regret comes in a los alamos celebration rally 
Aug 1 2023,positive, if nothing else directorwriter christopher nolan is a patient man whether it be his slow build of the psychological monolith that is batman begins or the controlled death spiral into the corners of the psyche in inception nolan has never been in a rush he has continued that approach with oppenheimer which at times is the undisputed best picture released so far this year and at other times one of the most frustrating this all comes from how nolan begins to quietly unfold the story of one of the most monumental moments in human history and then eventually gets to the big explosive moment oppenheimer  based on the biography american prometheus  examines the decision during world war ii by lt gen leslie groves jr matt damon to appoint physicist j robert oppenheimer cillian murphy to oversee the topsecret manhattan project america is in a race with germany to be the first to construct the first atomic bomb oppenheimers solution is to bring together the greatest scientific minds to a remote location in new mexico to design the weapon this led to the first nuclear explosion in 1945 an event that redefined the world nolans approach to the story was to build an arc of oppenheimers life from his days as an eager student to his battles to save his reputation this works because of a transformative performance by murphy as the man who would become known as the father of the atomic bomb murphy and nolan worked together on the batman trilogy and that history shows in this film every moment murphy is on screen is a controlled delivery of deep and dark emotions he never has to adjust the volume of his performance as the historical significance is enough to elevate each click through the scientists life his performance is in perfect step with nolans directing style nolans methodical approach to the story becomes so dependent on the players that what should have been the biggest bombshell  the creation and use of the atomic bomb  is almost a footnote it ends up just being the link between the first hour of the movie that establishes the characters and story points and the final hour where the emotional and political blasts finally reach the audience the easy approach would have been to focus on the nazis as the villains of the story that specter always hangs over the film but nolans determined approach leads to a more immediate threat from the chairman of the atomic energy commission lewis strauss robert downey jr the full story of the bloody war between strauss and oppenheimer isnt revealed until the third hour of the film when nolan finally decides to disclose that element the movie takes on a tension as great as the race to build the super weapon unlike his work in dunkirk nolan has not strayed too far away from the actual historical events it was his blatant manipulation of the real story of the soldier evacuation during world war that ended up being a major flaw in that production oppenheimer so often plays like the readings of a transcript that even moments that had to be filled in come across with a realistic punch a sticking point with oppenheimer is the time element nolan always has looked at time as more of a blip than continuous thread from memento to tenet that is acceptable with a fictional tale but there needs to be a more linear approach when it comes to history as nolan skips back and forth through oppenheimers life it becomes a test to keep track of whether the events are prebomb during the creation of the bomb or the postmortem bomb world a few time markers would have been handy nolan also continues to struggle with how to use women in his maledominated tales emily blunt turns in an impressive performance as oppenheimers troubled wife but she is never used enough and florence pughs role of jeanne tatlock  oppenheimers onagain offagain lover  comes across less as a way of showing the womanizing ways of the scientist and more of a nod to being gratuitous despite a few minor problems nolan has shown that with great patience comes great power it may take some time but eventually nolan shows his latest work is a blinding light of creativity to have a successful garden you need to know when it is the best time to plant here are the best plants to start in may
Aug 1 2023,positive,oppenheimer is on the cusp of changing the world mostly for the worst but barely focuses on the moral quandary of this all the nolan beats but were missing the snarky sorkin dialogue of a few good men and smooth tarantino style of inglourious basterds
Aug 1 2023,positive,nolan captures that theoretical aspect of oppenheimer on the screen in very personal moments that energy that swirl of passion in the unknown its all there and it is phenomenal to watch 
Aug 1 2023,positive,if it does nothing else this movie reminds us that the world still sits on the brink of global thermonuclear war and international political and military leaders have repeatedly demonstrated they are no wiser today than world leaders were 78 years ago
Aug 1 2023,positive, refrain from posting comments that are obscene defamatory or inflammatory and do not indulge in personal attacks name calling or inciting hatred against any community help us delete comments that do not follow these guidelines by marking them offensive lets work together to keep the conversation civil i am sure everything is commercialized including the movie reviews by so called critics it was showing houseful in bookmyshow and based on reviews i had made advance booking last night i went to watch this trash with 5 members of my family and 3 other viewers entire show was empty and we spent torturous 3 hours  it can be a story about someone but certainly not worth making a movie do we spend so much just to watch how a scientist was treated by a government  in so many years never watched such a pathetic movie want my money back along with compensation
Aug 1 2023,negative, oppenheimer is a whitejewish male view of history and that pov provides an oldfashioned slightly east coastbiased or anglocentric view of history despite attempts to make the film fill its diversity quota the film is disappointing in its blazing whiteness that blinds us to the truth of the world that j robert oppenheimer worked in and without the complications of racist reactions during a time of heightened hatred the audience is misled to the historic conclusions written and directed by christopher nolan the film is based on kai bird and martin j sherwins 2005 biography american prometheus the triumph and tragedy of j oppenheimer  the book was given the 2006 pulitzer prize for biography or autobiography i have not read the book so i can only comment on the film and what secondary sources report oppenheimer is portrayed as jewish but since he is portrayed by irish actor cillian murphy we should consider him as a whitepassing jew we meet the 22yearold j robert oppenheimer in 1926 on a dark and rainy day before the title a caption tells us prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to man for this he was chained to a rock and tortured for eternity this young man is tortured by homesickness hes far from home manhattan and studying under patrick blackett james darcy at the cavendish laboratory in the university of cambridge blackett an experimental physicist is reminded that danish physicist niels bohr kenneth branagh is giving a lecture oppenheimer has broken equipment in his lab experiment and blackett forces him to miss the lecture since he must at the very least clean up for himself out of spite oppenheimer uses a hypodermic to poison an apple left on blacketts desk oppenheimer catches the very end of the lecture but asks a question a question that he has asked before bohr made foundational contributions to the understanding of atomic structure and quantum theory for which he received the nobel prize in physics in 1922 he had founded the niels bohr institute then known as the institute of theoretical physics at the university of copenhagen in 1920  the next day regretting his decision to poison blackett he rushes to find that bohr has the apple in his hand claiming there is a worm hole the kind that involves a bug and not space he quickly dispatches the apple to the trash and has a discussion with bohr who asks the important thing isnt can you read music its can you hear it can you hear the music robert  oppenheimer is a lab disaster but he can hear the music of the universe and  transfers to the university of göttingen officially the georg august university of göttingen in 1942 oppenheimer meets us army general leslie groves matt damon and becomes involved in what will be called the manhattan project the race to develop the atomic bomb before the nazis the nazis have heisenberg heading their nuclear weapons program the us has many immigrant scientists some who have escaped the nazis by fleeing to the us or the uk while groves questions oppenheimer about his communist activities oppenheimer assures him that this wont be a problem yet we know that in the future it will be and the future is represented in another timeline filmed in blackandwhite oppenheimer assembles a team that includes edward teller benny safdie isidor issac rabi david drumholtz klaus fuchs christopher denham and david l hill rami malek  at los alamos new mexico he attempts to recruit albert einstein tom conti but fails los alamos isnt the only site but the central location between ucb radiation lab caltech project camel university of chicago columbia university oak ridge tennessee and other locations oppenheimer has a love for new mexico that predates the us entry into the war in 1941 so this is perhaps the real reason new mexico was chosen over other desert states eg nevada arizona the whole project is so hushhush that all team members must compartmentalize their lives yet although married oppenheimer continues his affair with tatlock although he eventually begins to distance himself from her when he learns of her suicide in 1944 4 january 1944 he is devastated his affair will come back to haunt both his professional and personal life   the race against germany becomes a moot point when germany surrenders in the spring of 1945 for reference but not present in the film benito mussolini is executed 25 april 1945 adolf hitler commits suicide 30 april 1945 oppenheimer still believes the atom bomb will be necessary for the war with japan pressed to complete and test the bomb before the potsdam conference 17 july to 2 august 1945 meeting of joseph stalin winston churchill clement attlee and president harry s truman in potsdam germany  the bomb is tested trinity test on 16 july 1945 despite poor weather  in the postwar world oppenheimer is a hero but after oppenheimer embarrasses lewis strauss robert downey jr also an american whitepassing jew strauss as chairman of the us atomic energy commission works to remove oppenheimer from his position of political influence strauss also believe that oppenheimer turned einstein against him strauss will ultimately pay for his pettiness and oppenheimer is given recognition much later  i knew that i had two timelines that we were running in the film one is in color and thats oppenheimers subjective experience thats the bulk of the film then the other is a black and white timeline its a more objective view of his story from a different characters point of view scenes in black and white kodak created and fotokem developed blackandwhite photographic film for imax show a different timeline that alone merits rewatching the film  you wont be disappointed with the depiction of the detonation of the first atom bomb but there will be other things that are disappointing despite obvious attempts to include diversity by showing african americans in the backgrounds as well as according to imdb on 31 july 2023 uncredited appearances of ansa woo as female student 70 jack wang as cambridge student and aamir yusuf as cambridge student and including women as intelligent people  spoiler alert the sex scene features cillian murphy as robert oppenheimer and florence pugh as jean tatlock pugh stops during intercourse gets up and goes over to the bookshelf picks out a copy of the bhagavad gita and asks murphy to read from it murphy reads the line i am become death destroyer of worlds the quote from the bhagavad gita that oppenheimer famously thought of when the first nuclear bomb was detonated  as intercourse resumes while in a gq interview murphy says that the sex scenes were vital in this film because the relationship that he has with jean tatlock is one of the most crucial emotional parts of the film the scenes are modest in their display of the male body my husband thought this was to prevent an rrating but the film has an rrating and comes 38 years after the nude scene in a room with a view which featured rupert graves as freddy honeychurch simon callow reverend beebe and julian sands george emerson that scene is nonsexual and makes the oppenheimer scene where both jean tatlock and oppenheimer are postcoital and having a discussion sitting across from each other with murphy having his legs coyly crossed so that while the camera lovingly considers pughs naked breasts murphys penis is well hidden by the carefully crossed and never uncrossed legs im thinking of sharon stone in the 1992 basic instinct  if there needs to be nudity why are we only given female genitals to admire could there have been a discussion of the hindu scripture at a bookstore or over coffee yes but it would likely not have had the same memorable impact for heterosexual men  the nudity here only serves the heterosexual male gaze and thus it would seem the nudity isnt really vital because the display of male genitalia isnt important to this film if oppenheimers genitalia dont give us clues to his crucial emotional attachment to tatlock then the exposure of tatlocks breasts provide no clues either particularly since we arent making a comparison between tatlock and oppenheimers wife  according to an art news article kai bird and martin j sherwins 2005 biography of oppenheimer american prometheus the triumph and tragedy of j robert oppenheimer the book on which nolans film is based upon notes that oppenheimer was raised in a manhattan family whose art collection included works of pablo picasso pierreauguste renoir rembrandt van rijn édouard vuillard and vincent van gogh  this exposure to art seems to be symbolized in the film by the appearance of painting that art news identifies as picassos woman sitting with crossed arms the 1937 painting is currently at the musée picasso in paris and is of mariethérèse walter a woman whom picasso began seeing romantically when he was 45 and she was 17 in 1927 the question then becomes why picasso particularly of a painting that was not in his familys collection early on in the film oppenheimer as played by cillian murphy rises as a physicist in training he meets the legendary scientist niels bohr who devised a legendary model for atoms that is still used today and is turned on to the magic of the discipline can you hear the music bohr asks oppenheimer at one point referring to the imagined sounds of invisible particles going about their business oppenheimer left cambridge for the university of göttinge according to the atomic archive oppenheimer arrived at the german university in 1926 where he studied under max born  writing for artnews alex greenberger suggests that the choice may be pablomatic picassos behavior toward women was bad as was oppenheimers oppenheimers philandering is portrayed in the film my husband thought the picasso painting represented oppenheimers interests in the spanish civil war which would eventually get him in trouble the year of woman sitting with crossed arms is the year that his father died and his fathers death according to britannica left oppenheimer a fortune that allowed him to subsidize antifascist organizations brittanica also notes that the tragic suffering inflicted by joseph stalin on russian scientists led him to withdraw his associations with the communist party though brittanica quickly notes that he never joined the party  the timeline britannica presents is that in 1939 oppenheimer began an affair with the married katharine pueninga botany grad student at ucla whom he would marry in 1940  yet by introducing art londonborn british and american director nolan has opened a pandoras box how can this oppenheimer a man aware of art be totally ignorant of japanese influence in california  japonism describes the influence of japanese art especially ukiyoe prints literally pictures of the floating or everyday world on french artists in the second half of the 19th century these prints were first exhibited in the japan pavilion at the 1867 paris worlds fair but also later at the école des beauxarts in 1890 the term japonism was coined in 1872 by the french art critic phillippe burty to describe the influence of japanese decorative objects as well as woodcuts on european art usually the term is applied to the work of the impressionists and postimpressionists who were specifically influenced by the flat blocks of color the emphasis on design and the simple everyday subject matter however the woodcuts of vallotton also demonstrate this influence with their flat shapes and asymmetrical design as do many of the works of bonnard and vuillard who painted scenes of everyday life taken from unusual points of view van gogh considered japanese prints a model of pure artistic expression uncorrupted by western modes of representation japanese art is something like the primitives like the greeks like our old dutchmen rembrandt potter hals vermeer ostade ruisdael he wrote to theo in july 1888 it doesnt end rather than simply continuing to copy japanese prints though van gogh began experimenting with aspects of them in his own paintings including the use of bright flat colours and strong diagonals closeup and birdseye views unconventional cropping the omission of the horizon and the isolation of prominent objects such as large cutoff tree trunks in the foreground inspired by the natural world he painted flowers including on several memorable occasions irises  comparing one of these springtime views to a japanese dream the japanese influence can be seen and felt in its simplicity and by incorporating themes from nature shibusa or shibui in its adjectival form is an important concept in japanese aesthetics while not easily translated it has been described as a calm understatement a quiet and sober refinement severe exquisiteness and interesting beauty just as they sought to improve modern design by looking at previous styles such as the gothic arts and crafts practitioners embraced japanese forms they admired japanese works because they like medieval art were thought to derive from a culture that was free from the depravities of modern industrialism as designers grew more knowledgeable about japanese art and culture they began emulating not merely the surface motifs they saw in the works but their underlying design strategies there are two california universities mentioned in oppenheimer the university of california berkeley and the california institute of technology in pasadena it would seem disingenuous for the film to pretend that oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists in california were unaware of the antieast asian racism present in berkeley or pasadena and the effects it had in these two institutes  in the spring of 1942 all persons of japanese ancestry in berkeley had one week to pack and prepare for their forced trip to the tanforan racetrack in san bruno they would be housed there for months in the horse stable stalls until they were transferred to remote areas for berkeley that meant 1300 residents those residents included uc berkeley faculty eg art professor chuira obata who was at ucb 19321954 and staff as well as about 500 students  at the ucb 1942 commencement sproul announced that the senior classs top student cannot be here today because his country called him elsewhere that student harvey akio itano had three weeks earlier been sent with his family to an internment camp tule lake itano who received his bs in chemistry had been chosen by the faculty as the university medalist for 1942 he would become a professor of pathology me phd at uc san diego  at caltech there were also professors who worked to assist their students  professor linus pauling fought particularly hard for two of his research assistants miyoshi ikawa and carol ikeda in both cases paulings intervention prevented these colleagues from being forcibly interned pauling found ikawa a place in the graduate program at the university of wisconsin ikawa would return to do postdoctoral research at both caltech and uc berkeley before becoming a professor at the university of new hampshire ikeda completed his phd at the university of nebraska he would later work at dupont  pauling was briefly a friend of oppenheimer having met him in europe june 1927 when oppenheimer accepted the position that split his time between caltech and berkeley the friendship was renewed however when oppenheimer invited paulings wife ava helen to travel with him to mexico and she reported this to pauling pauling immediately cut ties with oppenheimer  according to the pauling blog oppenheimer did extend an invitation for pauling to lead the chemistry division for the manhattan project after oppenheimer was given a loyalty hearing before the atomic energy commission pauling wrote an article that was published in the nation a disgraceful act 1 may 1954  another researcher at caltech robert a emerson persuaded government officials to permit rubber research to take place at the camps and then he had to convince japanese american scientists and nurserymen to join the project significantly he enticed his former graduate student shimpe nishimura to stay in the united states and eventually take over leadership of the manzanar research people who worked on the project included chemist kenzie nozaki and frank hirosawa dr masuo kodani homer kimura shuichi ogura and frank kageyama  kodani was from pasadena born in los angeles and had been a student at ucb graduated in 1938 his german jewish emigre advisor richard goldschmidt had tried to find him a position on the east coast but was unsuccessful  ogura was born in pasadena and was a visiting student at caltech  while manzanar was in california there were three internment camps in new mexicolordsburg ft stanton and santa fe lordsburg nm is about 400 miles or 56 hours away from los alamos ft stanton nm is about 220 miles or four hours santa fe to los alamos is about 1 hour or 34 miles  lordsburg us armyrun internment camp held japanese internees from hawaii the continental us and alaska from 19421943 the internees were moved mostly to santa fe so that prisoners of war from italy and germany could be held there ft stanton ins held mostly german seamen and german enemy aliens but was also a secret detention camp where 17 japanese american dissidents were held for six months the santa fe internment camp ins was located just 15 miles from downtown santa fe and eventually 4555 male internees passed through  the new york magazine article who are the japanese in oppenheimer  ryu spaeth a features editor at new york intelligencer wondered where the japanese were in nolans film  it is not nolans job to faithfully depict the japanese he has made a movie about j robert oppenheimer after all but some common understanding of this faraway foil is necessary for us to comprehend this historical figures significance nolan is most concerned with the fact that oppenheimer brought us into the nuclear age which gave humanity the ability for the first time to destroy itself the legacy of the bomb however is more specific and concrete than oppenheimers final vision of a world engulfed in nuclear fire at the very same instant that the bomb created modern japan in a burst of light it also gave rise to the america we know today  america as superpower two new nations were born from this expression of the bombs divine power and the cost of this transformation like some ghastly blood sacrifice were those 220000 human beings who were either incinerated or succumbed to radiation poisoning human beings oppenheimer said were necessary to target to show what havoc the weapon could really wreak which is to say that the inauguration of the american century would not have happened without the japanese but of course america does not see itself as sharing its history with anyone let alone that it has a ghostly sibling on the other side of the world which is how kai bird writing for the new york times on the occasion of oppenheimers release can say with a straight face that the real tragedy of oppenheimers life was that it discouraged scientists from standing up in the political arena as public intellectuals well no  the tragedy is that his genius was literally weaponized against a country that may no longer have posed a threat to him or his country against people who have been forgotten by their opponents if they were ever known at all would it really be possible for oppenheimer to have been oblivious to the antiasian sentiment in california and the internment of japanese american teachers faculty and students from caltech or ucb  shamefully antisemitism emerged even there when oppenheimer recommended a top student bob serber to be hired the appointment was blocked by department chairman raymond t birge who wrote a colleague saying one jew in the department was enough moreover oppenheimer represents the project as mostly a mens club looking at the us department of energys interactive history of the manhattan project it seems the project was a boys club however there were women involved and not just the one at los alamos who in the film notes she czechamerican lilli hornig was asked if she could type hornig who is portrayed by olivia thirlby was jewish and had accompanied her husband donald hornig played by david rysdahl to los alamos the film does include some debate on plutonium chemistry perhaps being too dangers for women particularly in reference to reproduction  but the world she graduated into on the eve of the pearl harbor attacks was rife with sexism and antiasian racism and wu found it hard to find a good academic position  because of world war ii and the subsequent communist takeover she would never see her parents alive again she is believe to be the only chinese american working on the manhattan project  it was reported that in 1940 you were listed as a sponsor of the friends of the chinese people an organization which was characterized in 1944 by the house committee on unamerican activities as a communistfront organization the second sinojapanese war had already begun in 1937 the first sinojapanese war was 18941895 with the 29 july 1937 tongzhou mutiny then the nanjing massacre that began on 13 december 1937 the chinese themselves were not a unified front having conducted a communist purge in jiangxifujian 19311935 and the ccp purged  koreans minsaengdan incident  suspected of supporting the japanese occupiers 19331936  the wartime hysteria affected not only japanese americans but also the chinese and other east asians remember california had led or supported many antiasian legal initiatives from the chinese exclusion act of 1882 to alien land laws  the wartime hysteria as well as the virulent antiasian sentiment in california is not mentioned at all in oppenheimer if one cannot intelligently discuss world war ii in europe without touching on antisemitism in germany europe and the us then one cannot possibly intelligently discuss the war against japan without discussing racism toward japanese and east asians in the us uk and canada even when someone mentions pearl harbor perhaps the average person in the us  forgets that the population of hawaii in 1940 was predominately japanese 139631 compared to caucasian at 112087 the chinese were 27179 and the filipino population was 63052 koreans were 6851 and native hawaiian were 64310 mainland usa had racist laws targeting east asians filipinos and native hawaiians as well as latinos and native americans during that time period  japan had been a us and uk ally in world war i so the question should be what soured that relationship to understand the full impact and implications of dropping the atom bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki one has to discuss antieast asian racism in the us uk and canada post world war ii the japanese a crew of 23 men on the daigo fukuryū maru 第五福龍丸were contaminated by the nuclear fallout on 1 march 1954 and pacific islanders were affected by 24 subsequent nuclear bomb detonations for testing between 19471958 at the bikini atoll  to understand the impact of the los alamos on new mexico racism toward latinos and native americans in the west california arizona new mexico etc needs to be discussed in the film murphys oppenheimer blithely assures therell be no problem acquiring los alamos theres a boys school well have to commandeer and the local indians come up here for burial rites this is barren land except it wasnt  there were in fact dozens of families within 20 miles largely poor families of ranchers and farmers many hispanic and indigenous who unwittingly went about their daily lives in the first fallout of the atomic age now those who were infants and children downwind of the detonation of the gadgeta code name for the plutonium bomb used in the trinity testare nearing the end of a decadeslong battle to be recognized and compensated for generations of illness they trace to exposure from radioactive fallout it should be noted that there was a latino team member of the manhattan project luis alvarez portrayed by alex wolff wolff is not latino but his father was jewish alvarezs grandfather was a spanish physician born in spain who lived in cuba before settling in the us  nolans source was written by two white men sherwin was born in brooklyn new york and died in washington dc 2021 he had served in the us navy in japan and received his phd in history at the ucla in 1971 thats just a year before david carradine would begin his yellow face run as eurasian kwai chang caine in the tv series kung fu sherwin had also published a world destroyed hiroshima and its legacies in 1975  sherwins coauthor kai bird was named after a refugee from communist china and educated in india high school but his ba was from carleton college northfield minnesota and his ms was from northwestern university evanston illinois he has been a freelance journalist in yemen bangladesh india and pakistan  the book  american prometheus was also published almost two decades ago 18 years  this was after the japanbashing of the 1980s and 1990s but before the current rise in antiasian sentiment related to  the covid19 pandemic in 2021 about 1200 people marched in  berkeley to protest antiasian hate in los angeles a solidarity march was held in koreatown 27 march 2021 in new york 22 march 2021 there was a demonstration in manhattans chinatown  the year 2021 was when universal pictures won the bidding war for nolans  oppenheimer script but antiasian racism began to rise in 2020 with the international public health emergency measures  nolans scripting of oppenheimer might have been better suited for the audiences of 2005 in the film japanese people are an abstraction and antieast asian prejudice in the west coast and the us is as nonexistent as the concerns of the people of new mexico there were people who were living in new mexico before oppenheimer inherited money from his father in 1937 and bought his perro caliente ranch and before los alamos was built in 1942  in the film oppenheimer the desert is portrayed as a wasteland instead of a fragile ecological system and a place where many generations of people had lived and would be as we know today secretly suffering from trinitys radioactive fallout for decades the possibility of cell damage and negative effects on reproductive cells is broached in the film in the discussion about hornig working with plutonium chemistry but the downwinders are given no consideration in the film and it isnt the case that the scientists didnt come into contact with the downwinders who according to the slate article were recruited for construction or custodial work in the 20142015 tv fictionalized tv series manhattan a chinese american scientist dr sidney liao who is played by eddie shin and day laborers and maids are included in the cast its one thing to think of an enemy an ocean away as an abstraction but another to callously decide the people working service jobs for the main characters as unworthy of safety considerations in this age that calls for diversity one has to ask in 2023 do we really need a white male compartmentalized version of history even if its idea of diversity is the inclusion of jewish american main characters oppenheimer strauss and einstein and some consideration of white women  oppenheimer had its world premiere in paris 11 july 2023 and then its british premiere in london 13 justly 2023 followed by its us premiere on 17 july 2023 oppenheimer was released theatrically in the us by universal pictures on 21 july 2023 
Aug 1 2023,positive, j robert oppenheimer the theoretical physicist in charge of the project and many others sweat it out in the new mexico desert as they watch the test from what they hope is a safe distance oppenheimer has told the military head of the operation lt gen leslie groves that chances of the explosion destroying the world are near zero groves response is that zero would be a much more comforting answer spoiler alert the world was not destroyed but watching this unfold on the screen waiting for the button to be pushed to set off the bomb you cant help but hold your breath and grip the armrests of your chair that alone tells you something about oppenheimer r 180 minutes in theaters christopher nolans epic film biothriller is so gripping that you feel like youre right there with oppenheimer anticipating the possible horrors his creation might unleash  never mind the horrors it did unleash in telling oppenheimers story writerdirector nolan dunkirk inception tells a complex story about a complicated brilliant man nolan doesnt just focus on oppenheimers involvement in the manhattan project which led to the nuclear bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki ending world war ii among other things it deals with oppenheimers personal life his communist ties and the postwar political repercussions of his leftist leanings in covering all of this and jumping back and forth in time in the process nolan presents an expansive story that seems oddly misshapen in which for instance the third act postbomb is extended into a story in itself in this case it doesnt seem to matter much though another example where it doesnt matter lawrence of arabia a magnificent epic whose first half is much stronger than the second oppenheimer is a breathtaking achievement and for many reasons the exceptional performances hoyte van hoyutemas majestic cinematography see this film on the largest screen possible ludwig goranssons grinding buzzing soundtrack which amps up the suspense the intelligence on display given my limitations i had to assume much of the scientific dialogue made sense the stillrelevant moral questions the film asks regarding weapons and war and the responsibilities of science and innovation cillian murphy plays oppenheimer with the same restraint that makes his gangster character in peaky blinders so compelling youre not encouraged to like oppenheimer or even necessarily understand him hes an intellectual snob a cold fish with an unpredictable moral compass he has no apparent qualms about sleeping with friends wives for instance outwardly he celebrates the success of the atomic bomb but hes also tortured by that success and tells president harry truman gary oldman in one brief scene that he feels he has blood on his hands harry doesnt take this well wearing a widebrimmed hat and suit cillians oppenheimer looks like a scientific gunslinger  a brainy variation on a clint eastwood or gary cooper western character  as he strolls through the los alamos desert community he creates for his scientific team he is the stuff of legend members of the allstar supporting cast also are remarkable robert downey jr in heavy makeup as a manipulative political figure out to destroy oppenheimers reputation and emily blunt as oppenheimers bitter alcoholic wife deliver oscarcaliber portrayals as characters different from any theyve played before at least that im aware of florence pugh as oppenheimers communist lover and matt damon as groves also are excellent also in the cast oldman kenneth branagh tom conti  as einstein casey affleck jason clarke benny safdie josh hartnett alden ehrenreich matthew modine  its quite the ensemble much has been made about oppenheimer and greta gerwigs barbie opening on the same day maybe its because they both are potential blockbusters in direct competition maybe its because of the filmmakers involved since nolan and gerwig are about as highly regarded as anyone these days maybe its because its hard to imagine two films being more different barbie pg13 114 minutes in theaters cowritten by director gerwig lady bird little women and noah baumbach the squid and the whale stars margot robbie as the living version of the famous barbie doll and ryan gosling as her sort of boyfriend beach and barbieobsessed ken barbie and ken live with other variations of barbie and ken in barbieland where almost everything is pink and according to barbie every day is the best day ever that is until barbie starts thinking of death and visits weird barbie kate mckinnon and learns about cellulite and other reallife phenomena barbie and ken wind up heading out to the real world where they are exposed to other things like oh the patriarchy and barbie befriends a mother gloria america ferrera and daughter sasha ariana greenblatt its a clever idea to use barbie and ken to explore gender roles and relationships personal identity and so forth if asked to name a toy for girls on family feud no doubt barbie would be first on the list but the mattel doll certainly can be and has been accused of setting up destructively unrealistic expectations in terms of body type and conforming to dated perceptions of women through this story gerwig suggests that barbie  and even lunkhead ken  can change with the times at the same time the film expresses the exasperation of modern women  especially through an amazing speech delivered by gloria about the impossible contradictory demands placed on them barbie has a lot of good qualities besides this speech robbie and gosling go for broke as their silly characters who struggle to understand where romance leads given they have no genitalia and they pull it off the art direction involved in the creation of barbieland  along with the costume design the hair and makeup etc  brilliantly engulf you in a colorful fantasy world the problem is that a little amount of barbie and ken goes a long way and the film eventually comes off as onenote barbie could have been a great saturday night live skit or even a series of snl skits but like some of those skits that have been turned into movies  coneheads and the waynes world movies

Jul 31 2023,positive, why settle for only one review when you can have many points of view oppenheimer is a dense historical film that several of us at intheirownleague has definite opinions about so read on and see if you agree with any of us on this new opus by christopher nolan christopher nolan has directed his best feature yet with oppenheimer walking into this film without knowing much about oppenheimer and his historical impact was a recipe that could have easily been disastrous in fact it did take me a little bit before i became invested in the film the nonlinear storytelling was a little confusing but halfway through the first act i was on board  this is a fascinating character study of a troubled human being dealing with the moral dilemma of his creation as a woman of science the conversations about the atom and quantum physics were music to my ears i was geeking out but it left me contemplating the bioethics involved in this scenario as scientists and explorers of the world we have a natural tendency to discover and experiment but where do we draw the line and how should we deal with the political machinations that push and manipulate scientists  nolans name comes with a level of prestige and he doesnt disappoint the sound score cinematography acting and overall execution are immaculate the film left me admiring the brilliance of the human brain and heartbroken with the reality of our complete lack of sympathy towards other human beings the ego is blinding and seeking control and power oftentimes ends in atrocities and horrors  with christopher nolans latest film it sometimes feels like he is looking back to his breakthrough film memento 2000 both films look at a person responsible for death being controlled by someone else unlike leonard shelby guy pearce j robert oppenheimer cillian murphy is at the whims of a government thinking more about the world supremacy that comes with an atomic bomb than the morality of having one grey moral areas are nolans specialty and he brings all his narrative tools to the haunted life of oppenheimer and the politics surrounding the creation of the atomic bomb its use and the nuclear proliferation to follow great performances from the intensely internal one from cillian murphy to the subtly bombastic robert downey jr and everyone in between and technical craft with breathtaking cinematography sound and a tense score carry this narrative in every way in what might be the directors finest film in greek mythology prometheus was punished for eternity for giving fire to man oppenheimer 2023 is essentially the story of prometheus but this one is frighteningly true a biopic of j robert oppenheimer its a chilling character study in which a man through scientific genius and just the right motivation gave humanity the power to eradicate itself through atomic warfare in the aftermath of the hiroshima and nagasaki bombings oppenheimers punishment was the overwhelming regret he felt once he realised what he had created writerdirector christopher nolan could easily have turned this feature into one of excuses but through hypnotic editing and confrontational yet empathetic direction he has made a staunchly antinuke film that decries the ways in which people desperately cling to modicums of supremacy despite its threehour runtime the film flies by the nonlinear narrative introduces its conclusions so that we become drawn into how events unfolded as one of sciences greatest minds becomes weighed down by his guilty conscience this is a film in which innovative righteousness and patriotic celebration have their veils removed to reveal grotesque ambition and the screams of civilians dying at the hands of this grotesqueness through spellbinding visuals a gripping script and cillian murphys magnificent performance this is not solely a remarkable character study its a film that through the filter of history dazzles with its mastery of craft directly challenging us on how the lust for power can and perhaps will one day destroy us all a tourdeforce of storytelling and historical analysis there is a strong case to be made for oppenheimer being nolans best film yet christopher nolan the most grandiose director currently working took the metaphor of the man who built the atomic bomb and used it as an allegory for himself  oppenheimers plot is built around one of oppenheimers critics strauss robert downey jr and his behaviour towards oppenheimer cillian murphy after the war the twisting subplots of the building of the bomb a security clearanceinvestigation oppenheimer must endure and strauss senate confirmation which hinges on that investigation twirl around the black hole at the storys center which is the largely undepicted truth of what the bomb oppenheimer built did in an unusually stacked supporting cast matt damon david krumholtz jason clarke and alden ehrenreich stand out but the women in oppenheimers life namely emily blunt as his wife and florence pugh as his communist lover have almost nothing to sink their teeth into but anyone whos seen nolans previous work knows this is par for his course women are plot devices or ornaments nothing more its the men in suits who count men with the power to shape life by taking it away are the only ones who matter and its their actions nolan depicts not their feelings for a movie about the potential end of humanity the most heated chitterchat is about unions in academia though nolan lets mr murphys exceptional cheekbones do most of his expressing for him and while nolan is winning friends by speaking up for the workers in presentday hollywood the inescapable sense is that this entire exercise is just a salve for his enormous ego i am nolan saviour of cinema look upon my works ye audiences and despair for what it is it works but its so boring when a man can demand so much to facilitate his achievement and still think he did it alone the hallmarks of a christopher nolan film are all here in oppenheimer the lush cinematography by hoyte van hoytema the operatic and haunting score by ludwig göransson the fx by scott r fisher and company all contribute to you knowing youre watching a nolan directed motion picture the script is adapted from american prometheus written by kai bird and martin sherwin which is more of a biography than an historical account of the manhattan project itself this distinction is important in understanding the focus of the film on oppenheimer himself and less on the story of the manhattan project the bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki and the resulting cold war  that focus can be somewhat frustrating in its convenient glossing over of the terror that oppenheimers work unleashed instead recounting his personal hell as a target of the mccarthy era robert downey jr already has well deserved oscar buzz swirling around his performance as lewis strauss oppies bugbear who stakes his career and reputation in destroying him publicly  as astonishing as cillian murphy is as oppenheimer and he is incredible showing the emotional cost that eroded the mans psyche and physical health he is upstaged by the depiction of what he called the gadget the trinity test scene will leave you breathless but the true horror for me came afterwards in a scene that shows his scientists cheering for him and him congratulating them only for all to be reduced to ash in his minds eye truly nightmare fuel and you wont leave the theater feeling safe and secure in your bed later on that is the point of oppenheimer and that is why this film is a must see
Jul 31 2023,positive, this sprawling epic chronicling the creation of the atomic bomb is the most balanced film yet from director christopher nolan who has too often sacrificed character studies for spectacle the easy part for director christopher nolan was making oppenheimer a bigscreen behemoth a sprawling epic chronicling the creation of the atomic bomb trickier was embedding within that blockbuster megaproduction a film of almost excruciating intimacy a psychodrama that probes the soul of perhaps the 20th centurys most unknowable man mission accomplished on both counts movies dont get any bigger than oppenheimer and seldom do they get under a characters skin more effectively this is the most balanced film yet from nolan inception interstellar who has too often sacrificed character studies for spectacle first the spectacle nolan has chosen to make oppenheimer on 70mm imax film a decision that creates a granular universe that pops to life even on the digital transfers most theaters will be showing a ridiculously obvious bit of advice absolutely see oppenheimer on the biggest screen you can in the tradition of the maxiscreen medium nolan and his perennial cinematographer hoyte van hoytema offer breathtaking vistas of the new mexico desert and picture postcard images of the lush university campuses the characters frequent filming almost entirely at or near the original locations in new mexico nolan even recreated the manhattan projects los alamos town  every board and nail of it  conjuring for me anyway temporary nervous memories of michael ciminos calamitous rebuild of 1880s casper wyoming for heavens gate then theres the movies centerpiece the detonation of the worlds first nuclear device  called the gadget by its creators  early one july morning in 1945 following an excruciatingly long countdown i had no stopwatch but i suspect those last few seconds are substantially drawn out the explosion erupts with hypnotic grace nolan takes dramatic advantage of the fact that depending on how far away you are youll see an explosion long before you feel and hear it as the fireball fills the screen nolan does the whole thing without a single digital effect the soundtrack is silent except for the breathing of oppenheimer who has left the safety of his bunker to stand mouth agape in the open air one knock on nolan has long been that he doesnt know when to tell his composers to put down their pens here ludwig göranssons soaring score falls silent with unnerving results as for the human element never before has nolan found such perfect balance for a films secret sauce cillian murphy seems born to play oppenheimer  compare him here with photos of the physicist and it is frankly hard to tell them apart murphys wide blue eyes seem to stare in perpetual horror at visions of what oppenheimers creation hath wrought his haunted gaunt visage betrays the scientists own private lifelong condition of shock and awe concerning matters of quantum physics murphy is the singularity around which the entire film orbits but the whos who supporting cast suggests that all of hollywood was waiting by the phone hoping nolan would call matt damon pleasingly lumpy and charmingly officious is gen leslie groves the military officer in charge of the manhattan project emily blunt and florence pugh play the most prominent women in oppenheimers life although there were reportedly many more and they make it almost believable that anyone would be willing to devote their lives to a guy with his head not merely in the clouds but in the cosmos only one actor has ever won an oscar for acting in a christopher nolan film that was heath ledger as joker in the dark knight and lets face it ledger was a directorproof creature certainly murphy has a best actor shot this time but the shooin supporting actor nod has got to go to robert downey jr as lewis strauss the 1950s tycoon who was alternately oppenheimers greatest promoter and worst enemy downey disappears into the role eyes like saucers behind round dark eyeglasses vanishing hair brushed into a pitiful combover embodying the twin qualities of power and paranoia downey evokes a latecareer henry fonda with compelling results elsewhere beneath masterful makeup youll spot tom conti as albert einstein gary oldman as harry truman and kenneth branagh as physicist niels bohr one guy turns up seemingly just to pick up something that oppenheimer has dropped and i couldve sworn it was bohemian rhapsody star rami malek sure enough malek returns an hour or so later to give one of the films pivotal speeches which brings up the one weak link in oppenheimers cinematic chain reaction its 3hour length the studio released a photo of the celluloid imax version sitting on a projector noting that unspooled the physical film would stretch 11 miles as if that were a good thing for such an assured piece of filmmaking youd think nolan would have known when to end oppenheimer the climactic explosion comes roughly two hours into the film then settles into chronicling the scientists turbulent mccarthy era during which he lost his security clearance  and access to government contracts  due to early contacts with american communists fair enough but nolan insists on subjecting oppenheimer and us to one impassioned speech after another in front of a commission that we already know has been rigged by strauss to toss him under the bus its an important chapter but compared to the worldchanging events that came before this one is worth at most 20 minutes or so when the admittedly powerful finale finally came im sorry to say i was glad oppenheimer was over and thats no way to feel about a film that gets so much so monumentally right
Jul 30 2023,positive, oppenheimer is utter perfection its a timeless movie for the ages with a lengthy running time thats worth every scene for its history character development direction and a memorable score directorcoscreenwriter christopher nolans genius  also obvious in the likes of dunkirk inception and the dark knight is evident in every frame of this biopichistory of the atomic bomb cillian murphy well known for peaky blinders may very well earn the best actor academy award for his portrayal of the physicist who changed the outcome of world war ii and indeed global politics the audience sees oppenheimer as a brilliant student of the world around him  art languages politics and science all intrigue the young man he understands when german scientists split the atom in 1938 that this achievement could be used in weaponry oppenheimers politics and his connections to the american communist party are called into question by maj gen leslie groves matt damon leader of the manhattan project the united states name for the development of the atomic bomb the rest as they say really is history with an allstar cast including robert downey jr rami malek gary oldman kenneth branagh and emily blunt as oppenheimers wife and florence pugh as his mistress i still cant believe this film is three hours long i didnt feel it i never felt the time drag and every sequence is engaging to have a successful garden you need to know when it is the best time to plant here are the best plants to start in may
Jul 29 2023,positive, this line from ts eliots triumph of modernist poetry the waste land encapsulates christopher nolans granular approach to the life of j robert oppenheimer the father of the atomic bomb who reads the poem in his university days haunted by visions of atoms and stardust too tortured to sleep oppenheimer based on kai bird and martin j sherwins biography american prometheus the triumph and tragedy of j robert oppenheimer is an existentialist portrait of a man caught between his own petty humanity and his ability to peer into the very fabric of the universe and understand it over the course of three hours oppie as his colleagues call him finds himself both master of and subject to the principles of quantum physics straining to reconcile the vast matrices of war and politics with his own almost obstinate naivete and blind loyalty to his own impulses strong attractions as he tells his wifetobe at a party when she asks him to explain his field of study fissionat its best oppenheimer is a character study that uses its protagonist to atomize the worldly implications of the distinction between theory and practice between humanity and life as a human being and oppenheimer is the perfect vessel for the task embodied by cillian murphy this complex figure is explored as more than just a part of history but as a man torn asunder by what nolan rightly calls impossible ethical dilemmas source universal picturesoppenheimers life is a mess of contradictions as an adult he went from the living rooms of the leftist academic intelligentsia to los alamos where

systematic underhanded discrediting by the united states a smear campaign that he did little to fight whether he likes it or not as his berkeley colleague the eventual nobel prize winner ernest lawrence josh hartnett frustratedly tells him oppenheimer isnt just selfimportant hes actually important the narrative of oppenheimers life certainly holds more than ample fascination for even a film with a threehour runtime and the story is treated comprehensively with care and depth yet nolans film fixates on the strange character of the man himself presenting him as an impossible force and an immovable object at odds with his own temperament he cant help but set himself up for failure at every turn he is impulsive and egotistical injecting cyanide into his professors apples but snatching

Jul 29 2023,positive, a biopic of masterful craft and heavy emotion oppenheimer is a high stakes story of war politics and the inner battle of a complicated  mind who changed the world with fire and fury now i am become death the destroyer of worlds this line  from the bhagavadgita  a 700verse hindu scripture  was famously quoted by  robert j oppenheimer during an nbc documentary that aired in 1965 oppenheimer  known universally as the father of the atomic bomb is also the subject of  christopher nolans latest film and it is one of the revered directors best  yet  intellectually engaging visually and sonically  stimulating and packing an emotional wallop oppenheimer further  cements nolans standing as the thinking mans blockbuster filmmaker while  placing the spotlight on one of the 21st centuries most brilliant  minds and his most infamous achievement the creation of the atomic bomb that decimated  the japanese islands of hiroshima and nagasaki thus ending world war ii skipping back and forth between different time periods as  well as black and white and colour photography nolan knocks the dust off the  stuffy biopic formula and delivers a movie that is pulsating with energy and  epic in scope he also does so without losing the intimacy of retracing the  peaks and valleys in the life of a giant in the science community a man whose  logic driven approach to his work is often upended by the unconventional and  even egotistical blunders made in his personal life                                           cillian murphy delivers perhaps his best feature film  performance yet as oppenheimer portraying the eccentricities and fragilities  of this brilliant mind with an impressive restraint as the guilt that consumes  oppenheimer slowing eats him up inside great too are the films numerous  supporting performances robert downey jr delivers one of his best turns as lewis  strauss the bitter and shrewd head of the atomic energy commission matt damon  brings his magnetic movie star charisma to the role of general leslie groves  the director of the manhattan project and emily blunt brings both fragility  and strength as oppenheimers put upon wife kitty  when oppenheimer focuses on the witch hunt against  the famed scientist who was accused of being a spy for the soviet union the  film shifts from a story about the fight within the soul of a man to the fight  for the soul of a nation as swampy figures within us government bureaucracy  and intelligence conspire to drag oppenheimer down into the thick stench of accusation  and character assassination while much has been made about the frightening nature of oppenheimer regarding the danger of nuclear war and rightfully so perhaps the biggest  takeaway from the film is how almost 80 years later duplicitous figures  within the us government still utilise the same old tricks to usurp their  enemies  the technical craft in oppenheimer is fantastic shot  on imax film the photography by hoyte van hoytema dunkirk is  rich and dense the sound design by richard king inception and  his team is an immersive sonic journey and the editing by jennifer lame hereditary  is a masterclass in nonlinear structure it all culminates in the trinity test  one of the best  sequences in a nolan film  in which oppenheimer and his team of scientists in  los alamos new mexico undertake the first test of an atomic bomb they have  spent four years and 2 billion creating the recreation of this significant moment  in science is as aweinspiring as it is frightening it is also a reminder of  how mankind unfortunately continuous to use its god given intelligence and ingenuity  to create weapons of mass destruction while lost in the fog of war 
Jul 29 2023,positive, oppenheimer the latest from christopher nolan is a searing portrait of a man plagued by visions of a world that cant be seen a theoretical world composed of the literal particles of his ideas driven by an unyielding need to bring his visions to light j robert oppenheimer cillian murphy struggles with the notion of bringing theory into practice reminiscent of the very process of filmmaking its a film about the creation of something not before seen and the consequences this entails its set against the backdrop of oppenheimers hearing to renew his security clearance and maintain his vocal political influence on the united statess atomic policy a semblance of control over the further development of the weapon he helped unleash oppenheimer maintains several states at once shifting backward to oppenheimers early education and to his involvement in the manhattan project and forward to the contentious cabinet hearing of former chairman of the atomic energy commission and friendturnedantagonist lewis strauss robert downey jr visually its clear to see nolans love of the physicality of film of the process of transferring concepts to a physical medium and using the physical medium to present those ideas to the world nolan uses the development of the manhattan project to symbolize his own efforts were witness to jarring visions of the physical processes oppenheimer sees in his head images of chaotic motion of particles unharnessed energy with the potential to create new worlds and destroy our current one for a film framed around political proceedings theres very little interest in political analysis here communism is used as a backdrop but ideology isnt the focus and nolan spends little time delving into the brunt of the political conditions his characters advocate for narratively its one of nolans more straightforward efforts in recent years which despite its linear shifts maintains a clear through line and focus the ensemble cast puts in stunning performances led by murphy and downey and emily blunt is compelling as the equally troubled katherine kitty oppenheimer from the onset oppenheimer in all its jarring imagery and sound sears its way into the viewers brain its an effectively devastating portrayal of the formulation of events that unleashed unprecedented destruction onto the world the results of which were still caught in the looming shadow of today r 180 min 
Jul 29 2023,negative, if you like film at all youll no doubt be seeing christopher nolans epic threehour biopic oppenheimer considering the cinematic doldrums lately why wouldnt you go for this hugely hyped wildly praised spectacle which is bound to be given every known award youll spend the hours studying legendary physicist and father of the atomic bomb j robert oppenheimer played by cillian murphy in vast closeups especially if you see the film in imax which makes murphys face seem as tall as skyscrapers and his wide blue eyes as big as swimming pools the attempt to understand what made oppenheimer tick is as old as the abomb and this film tackles it afresh clearly with the assumption that itll all be news to the younger generation if youre already convinced of the dangers of nuclear war superseded only by the ongoing endtimes series of rolling climate catastrophes that now seem more likely to kill us all this film is going to lack a certain urgency however still all of the nolanisms beloved by his fans  who are legion after such career hits as the dark knight the dark knight rises inception interstellar and dunkirk  are represented nolans traditional emotionally melodramatic hollywood movie tendencies are as usual dressed up in intricate flashbacks narrative trickiness pyrotechnic editing flourishes and pounding soundtrack bombast and because nolan can now stack his casts with famous actors as yet another aspect of his skyhigh production values youll have the repeated experience of registering celebrity faces as characters are introduced and so many characters get introduced scenes sometimes play like handshaking parties theres matt damon as lieutenant general leslie groves who brought on oppenheimer as the head of the secret mission to win world war ii by creating an atomic bomb theres robert downey jr as lewis strauss chairman of the us atomic energy commission theres tom conti as albert einstein theres kenneth branagh as danish physicist niels bohr theres benny safdie as father of the hydrogen bomb edward teller theres josh hartnett    and rami malek    and casey affleck im hinting in my subtle way that i dont particularly like christopher nolan films in general so thats something to note as you read this review i also dont like this film in particular but of course there are innumerable rave reviews of oppenheimer so mine stands as a rare dissenting opinion the film is constructed in a way that suggests trying to pull together the fissured strands of oppenheimers personality even while acknowledging that theres no way to arrive at a sensemaking whole when contemplating his visionary brilliance his vacillating politics his turbulent love life his triumph and tragedy as the modern prometheus and his interludes of swaggering hubris combined with his interludes of guiltridden reticence ultimately oppenheimer is treated as an oceanic mystery of a man raised to the sky in public opinion for in the view of the majority saving the allies from the ongoing horrors of fascism and world war ii then cruelly pilloried on trumpedup anticommie charges but the real punishment is his awesome guilt in leading the effort to unleash the horrors of nuclear war upon us nolan deploys a citizen kanelike model of narrative fracturing to convey oppenheimers dizzying complexity in the crucible in which he found himself orson welless original title for citizen kane was american and he makes kanes material circumstances a vital issue in his film born into the hardscrabble working class he becomes incredibly wealthy overnight through access to vast american natural resources  in his case literally striking it rich with the colorado lode mining bonanza this makes possible his ascent to fame and great man status while hollowing him out at the same time catastrophically cutting him off from his own family and community like welles nolan embraces the idea of the final unknowability of the character early in nolans film for example you see the incredible incident of the deadly poisoned apple that the resentful student oppenheimer gives his professor this turns out to be based on something that really happened while oppenheimer was studying at the university of cambridge nolan represents oppenheimer with aching sympathy as a lonely boy genius homesick and further isolated from his peers by his obsessive visions of structures underlying the teeming chaos that seems to make up the world hes shown to be pitifully selfconscious of his own incompetence in the lab which doesnt exactly match the real oppenheimers superior tone in describing his cambridge education to a friend i am having a pretty bad time the lab work is a terrible bore and i am so bad at it that it is impossible to feel that i am learning anything    the lectures are vile nolan based his film on a pulitzer prizewinning biography that also regards oppenheimer with tender pity attributing his act of poisoning to his recurrent depression robert did something so stupid that it seemed calculated to prove that his emotional distress was overwhelming him write the biographers kai bird and martin sherwin in american prometheus the triumph and tragedy of j robert oppenheimer consumed by his feelings of inadequacy and intense jealousy he poisoned an apple with chemicals from the laboratory and left it on blacketts desk oppenheimer injected an apple with some toxic substance that was perhaps not as lethal as the cyanide represented in the film in which a remorseful oppenheimer is portrayed as waking up in the morning shocked at his own murderous act he races back to the professors office to retrieve the apple from his desk to his horror one of his idols  niels bohr  is just about to take a bite out of the apple when oppenheimer snatches it away with the breathless explanation wormhole thats not actually what happened in real life accounts are a bit vague but they agree that somehow oppenheimers poisoned apple created no casualties but still got found out by the authorities at cambridge oppenheimers father had to hurry to prevent young oppie from being expelled in part by guaranteeing his sons regular visits to a psychiatrist notsoyoung oppenheimer went on to further acts of reckless hubris according to a review of another recent oppenheimer biography as a young professor in california he crashed his car while racing a train an accident that left his girlfriend unconscious his father made amends by giving the young woman a painting and a cézanne drawing why not include oppenheimers far more cinematic daredevil race against the train in this biopic its every bit as telling of what comes later as the highly symbolic poisoned apple incident is oppenheimer gave all of humanity a poisoned apple but he failed to snatch it away again see the womanizing oppenheimer is shown to be an unintentional but nevertheless total disaster to the women in his life though admittedly he seems drawn to dark depressive humorless women who happen to be members or former members of the communist party his longtime love jean tatlock florence pugh commits suicide when oppenheimer ends their lengthy onandoff affair his longsuffering alcoholic wife kitty emily blunt is shown to be curdling into everangstier meanness during their marriage and repeatedly rejecting motherhood in the harshest way but theres no way to make the starker weirder more shockingly arrogant aspects of oppenheimers personality conform to the portrait that nolans building here youll wait a long time for an american biopic to make a serious effort to tell the harsher truth its a terrible genre for that reason the more interesting insightful aspects of famous lives are almost inevitably censored drawing on cillian murphys pitiful thinness  which he achieved through dramatic weight loss he could hardly afford  and the softer possibilities of his pinkmouthed bigeyed face nolan presents us with a perpetually distracted endearingly eccentric brainy naif who gets carried away with his own visions and enthusiasms until its too late to reckon with the crushing consequences of what hes done theres little sense especially of oppenheimers wellknown towering ambition it could certainly help account for some otherwise puzzling behaviors of his such as his insistence on appearing before the kangaroo court assembled to remove his security clearance and tarnish his reputation in ways potentially fatal to his titanic career this was well into the mccarthy era of blacklisting leftists for far less involvement in communist politics than oppenheimer had however scattershot his actual activities were by 1954 the likely consequences were obvious einstein himself warned oppenheimer against appearing and then when oppenheimer refused to listen dismissed him in a cutting remark to his assistant there goes a narr which is german for fool oppenheimers refusal to dodge the hearing is credited to his heartfelt patriotism but surely his sense of selfimportance and untouchability was a part of it too as the film demonstrates once on the receiving end of the commissions attacks oppenheimer became soft and cagey in a way that infuriated his wife who wanted him to put up a strong fight against the forces of american government behind the blacklist nolan represents this as a kind of martyrdom of saint oppenheimer but a certain amount of crass careerism couldve been portrayed as kicking in more overtly here when his wife shrills why wont you fight after all he had a lot to lose as nolans film demonstrates postwar oppenheimer was famous considered the top scientist in america and maybe the world celebrated on the cover of time magazine his conviction that he could help guide the governments handling of nuclear weapons along more humanely concerned lines really did get him dismissed by harry s truman as a crybaby but the fact is he was actually getting consulted by the president and every other important suit on down the line nolans is the kind of film that features an ahistorically dramatic line delivery and a pause for a shudder of horror from the audience when someone mentions the name of los alamos the obscure desert location of oppenheimers secret atomic bomb building and testing site theres exactly the same kind of ahistorical frisson in gone with the wind 1939 when rhett butler mentions the battle shaping up in a tiny pennsylvania town that might decide the fate of the entire civil war called  weighty pause  gettysburg theres also more than once the intoning of oppenheimers own famously hammy quote from the hindu text the bhagavad gita in reaction to his work on the ultimate weapon of mass destruction now i am become death the destroyer of worlds in real life oppenheimers detractors noted that his pretentious quotes drawn from extensive if eclectic reading were among his more maddening rhetorical traits but there can be no humorous eyerolling at such pronouncements in this film which makes me appreciate even more the wild and funny barbenheimer mashup memes making the rounds about the incongruous yet oddly cold warcompatible sameday opening of barbie and oppenheimer my favorite one shows an eerie distorted blackandwhite image of the face of reallife oppenheimer with the caption now i am become barbie girl in barbie worlds but the anxious wouldbe profundity in the handling of the films subject matter is part of the typical nolan strategy of informing the world and the members of the academy and other awardgiving entities of the importance of his chosen subject nolan is making the press rounds saying that j robert oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived so it logically follows that his film is crucial viewing and that all of his seriously considered directorial choices are also terribly important critics take down the information about these choices like publicists and report them faithfully to a duly impressed public  such as nolans surprising decision not to show the japanese victims of the atomic bombings instead we see oppenheimer merely imagining the effects of the bomb on members of his rapturous american audience but the absolute lack of physical reality given to the results of dropping atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki  the refusal to portray mass annihilation  is one of the films more stunning glossingover effects its ludicrous the idea that oppenheimers imaginings safe in the united states of the flayed skin of a few people in his audience who are applauding his speech and a charred body impeding his path as he takes his triumphal march away from the podium is somehow more effective and chilling not showing in any memorable or realistic way the ghastly consequences of oppenheimers biggest achievement is a safeplaying strategy once again to preserve audience sympathy for the hero which you generally need if you want a big blockbuster hit and christopher nolan always wants a big blockbuster hit
